          "text": "Sola Fasure, the Media Adviser to the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has given a reason for the deletion of a social media post on the minister\u2019s handle.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported the minister shared a post on social media after the defeat of Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, in the just-concluded Osun State Governorship election.\n\nBut hours after the post had gone viral, it was deleted.\n\nFasure\u2019s reaction was contained in a statement titled, \u2018Ignore unauthorised message posted on Ogbeni Aregbesola\u2019s pages\u2019.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt has come to the attention of the media office of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, that an unauthorized message was posted on his Verified Twitter and Facebook Pages at about 8:00am on Sunday 17th July, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe unauthorised messages have now been deleted. Members of the public, especially the media, are advised to ignore it!\u201d\n\nThe former Osun State governor, who boycotted the election, had remained silent on development in Osun State after his outburst against the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress and his political boss, Bola Tinubu, in February 2022.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission on Sunday morning declared Ademola Adeleke the Governor-Elect of Osun State after scoring a majority of votes cast in the governorship election in the state.\n\nThe victory came for Adeleke nearly four years after failing by a small margin in his bid to govern Osun State.\n\nOn Saturday, Adeleke polled 403,371 votes to defeat his closest rival, the incumbent governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola, who polled 375,027 votes.\n\nThough 15 political parties participated in the election, the top contenders were Oyetola and Adeleke.\n\nBoth Oyetola and Adeleke contested for the Osun governorship seat in 2018, which Oyetola won after a rerun.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Aregbesola had publicly moved against the second-term ambition of Governor Oyetola.\n\nInstead, Aregbesola endorsed the former Secretary to the State Government, Moshood Adeoti, who later lost to Oyetola at the APC governorship primary election held on February 19, 2022.\n\nAregbesola reacted to the election in a now-deleted post titled, \u2018Osun Le Tente\u2019, connoting the wish of the Osun people excelled, on Sunday morning.\n\nHe posted a bible verse, Daniel 4:17, which exalts God\u2019s power to place control in the hands of whoever He wishes.\n\n\u201cThis matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.\u201d \u2013 (Daniel 4:17),\u201d the minister posted.\n\nIn the outburst ahead of the party\u2019s governorship primary election in the state, Aregbesola said that enough is enough for the politics of godfatherism and enthronement by treacherous leaders who equated themselves to the status of a god.\n\nThe minister had said he trusted Tinubu, but the ex-governor of Lagos State repaid him with betrayal.\n\nAregbesola, who was the Governor of Osun State from 2010 to 2018, also accused Tinubu and ex-governor of Osun State, Bisi Akande, of forcing the current governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola, on the people, against popular will.\n\nThough Aregbesola made moves to reconcile with his political boss Tinubu, the efforts yielded no result.\n\nA few hours before the governorship election, a faction of the APC led by the minister, The Osun Progressives, released a statement noting that despite the feud, its members would remain in APC.\n\nThis was after a stalwart of the APC and one of the closest loyalists to Aregbesola and a TOP mobiliser, Kolapo Alimi, defected to the PDP.\n\nOur grievances with Oyetola \u2013 TOP\n\nThe TOP\u2019s position was contained in a post shared by a former commissioner in the state, Sikiru Ayedun, on Friday.\n\nThe group alleged maltreatment of its members by Governor Gboyega Oyetola\u2019s administration.\n\nPart of the statement issued by TOP read, \u201cOur association, a caucus within the State of Osun All Progressives Congress (APC), was founded last year when we alarmingly saw the direction our party was going. It was like the falcon could no longer hear the falconer. We were filled with trepidation on the tempest long foretold.\n\n\u201cWe were at this junction before, in the run-off to the 2003 General election. We feared that history might tragically repeat itself except we acted selflessly and forthrightly. Like-minded members and leaders of the party, therefore, came together to form the group.\n\n\u201cAs a caucus within the party, we have consistently made strident efforts at peace and reconciliation within our party. For this, we have only asked for one condition, which is inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cThe State Governor and his henchmen, most regrettably, have turned his office and our party into a zero-sum game. You are either with them or against them. They rejected any idea of inclusiveness. They rebuffed all propositions for peace and reconciliation and not even a Councillorship position was ceded to any other section of the party outside of the Ileri-Oluwa caucus.\n\n\u201cAny party member that is not publicly demonstrating obscene loyalty to the governor and attacking Ogbeni Aregbesola or anyone remotely or directly associated with him is branded an enemy and marked for alienation from government and party offices. Worse still, the independent-minded party members not praise singing the Governor are subject to insidious and malevolent attacks.\n\n\u201cThe policy of exclusion in Osun APC is so deep that Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola who is the immediate past Governor of the state and the current minister from the state was neither consulted, invited nor included in any party matter, the most recent of which is the APC\u2019s Osun Campaign Council for this election. This posturing has riven the party.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we remain unflinching members of our party, the All Progressives Congress and stand by its ideals, irrespective of our travails or even the outcome of the election. We are long-distance runners and will not abandon the ship of our party, in calm or stormy waters.\u201d\n\nWhy Aregbesola shunned Osun election -Aide\n\nAregbesola did not partake in the Osun State Governorship election.\n\nIt was learnt that the former governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, has travelled abroad to attend a conference.\n\nAccording to an aide of the minister, Aregbesola shunned the election to avoid a crisis.\n\nIt was learnt that the minister was in Lagos State on Thursday before travelling to Abuja on Friday.\n\nWhen contacted, Aregbesola\u2019s media adviser, Sola Fasure, confirmed the minister\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cHe proceeded on an official assignment on Friday,\u201d Fasure said.\n\nThe media aide noted that Aregbesola was not invited to work for Oyetola\u2019s second-term bid in Osun.\n\nHe also said the minister was not named in the Osun State campaign team by the All Progressives Congress.\n\nHe said, \u201cAregbesola is not in Oshogbo. He is on an official assignment. He was not invited and not a part of the election council. The governor did not also invite him to be part of the campaign.\u201d",

It will also help us as a guild financially wise. Most of us find it strenuous accessing loans and financial assistants for our projects; that is what forming a co-operative society will address. As a co-operative society, we can also buy things cheap and resell to our members, as a way of assisting ourselves to cope with the economical situation of the country and stop us from going through unnecessary stress to get bank fundings..\u201d Victor Okhai pointed out.\n\nAlthough forming a co-operative society was a part of his campaign promises, Victor Okhai however insisted that joining the co-operative society would be at the discretion of members, stressing that the guild won\u2019t force members to join the co-operative society.\n\n\u201cPart of the reasons for our forming a multi-purpose cooperative society is to help our members also have a good savings culture and to help us access funds for our businesses. The guild is an NGO but the multipurpose cooperative society will enable members engage in business activities that the guild ordinarily would not be able to.\u201d He stated.\n\nThe team from the Lagos State government who were in agreement with what Victor Okhai siad, further explained the types of co-operative society available to the guild, while also lecturing the people present on the seven principles of the co-operative society and the core co-operative values.\n\nThe types of co-operative societies available for members of the public to join according to the Lagos State team, are; the co-operative thrift and credit society, the co-operative multi-purpose society, amongst others.\n\nThe highlights of the inauguration was the swearing in of executive leaders for the guild\u2019s co-operative society.\n\nThose chosen to lead the guild\u2019s co-operative society are; Victor Okhai, who will be the president of the co-operative society, Kingsley Omoefe, who will be the secretary and Osita Okolie, who will act as the treasurer of the co-operative society.

          "text": "By Ugochukwu Alaribe \u2013 Umuahia\n\nAbia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has directed the chairman of Ariaria International Market, Elder Emeka Igara to ensure that all the blocked drainages in the market were desilted within 7 days.\n\nIkpeazu who gave the directive at the end of a crucial meeting with some selected stakeholders of the market in Aba,said he was disturbed with the news about the recent effect of flood on traders in the market following torrential rains in the past three weeks.\n\nThe Governor who was represented by the Commissioner for Trade and Investment, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu, decried the attitude of some traders and residents of the area who dump refuse in the drainages in and around the market instead of the government approved dumping sites.\n\nRead Also:\n\nAbia can\u2019t develop with less than N200bn annual budget \u2014 Emenike\n\nUmuchieze Cattle Market: Ikpeazu inaugurates Committee, charges on Security\n\nMakinde, Ikpeazu celebrate with Wike as son graduates from UK university [Photos]\n\nHe disclosed that the government is determined to bring a lasting solution to the menace of flooding in the market.\n\nSpeaking on the ongoing 1st phase of reconstruction of shops at A Line, the Commissioner explained that the state government is committed to remodelling the Ariaria International Market to and appealed to the traders to exercise patience as the state government works to resolve the bottlenecks causing delays in the speedy completion of the job.\n\nHe assured the traders that the ongoing reconstruction of shops at A Line was dear to the governor of the state, stressing that no original shop owner was going to lose his or her shop(s).\n\n\u201cWhat slowed down the job at A Line, which effectively commenced in April 2022 are the rains. July is always a difficult time in construction but we are going ahead with the blocks while hoping to return to the road aspect as soon as we have better weather conditions for the implementation of rigid pavement technology.\n\n\u201cYou should exercise patience with us. But I can assure you that the governor is interested in the delivery of a world class market infrastructure in Ariaria, hence the support we are giving to the designated developer.\n\n\u201cThe governor wants to ensure that the work is completed before he leaves office with minimal disruption to trading activities. It was for this reason that we made sure that affected traders whose shops were demolished for the purpose of the reconstruction were re-settled within the market to carry on trading while we work in phases.\n\n\u201cHe has therefore directed chairman of the Ariaria market, Elder Igara and his team to ensure that work starts on identified blocked drainages in the market.\n\n\u201cAriaria is on a low land and at the moment lower than Faulks Road and that is why water from Ariaria cannot flow into the gutter on Faulks road. Our work plan includes to raise the market so that we can achieve gradient storm water flow into the drains on Faulks Road.\n\n\u201cAnother major issue is that the federal government contractor on Enugu-Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway channeled the water on the road to Ariaria, instead of providing drains thereby adding more pressure to the amount of water flowing into Ariaria from the expressway/Enyimba area. We are engaging with them to see how they can adjust their work plan to include provision of drains around the area.\n\n\u201cThe idea of scooping the drainages is to bring a temporary relief to the issue of flood in Ariaria.

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru & Ibrahim Ogalah\n\nPresident Muhammdu Buhari, yesterday, revealed that a particular governor of the All Progressives Congress, APC, pressed him to disclose his preferred candidate for the flag bearer of the ruling party before the election of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nSpeaking in Daura, Katsina State, during Sallah homage to the Emir of Katsina, Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, Buhari affirmed that the process that led to Tinubu\u2019s election was purely democratic, and reflection of the will of party members.\n\nThe President, in statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu,was quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cWhen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) signaled parties to elect their presidential candidates, we had 30 aspirants, mostly ministers in my cabinet and governors.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI told each of the aspirants to go and do their best. One particular governor, in his wisdom, came to meet me and asked who they should vote for at the party convention, checking if I had a preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere was no need for interference, knowing the competence of all the aspirants. They went and elected Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and he picked his running mate, Sen. Kashim Ibrahim, in a process for the 2023 elections. I am praying that we will have peaceful and successful elections.\u201d\n\nThe President said the openness and fairness with which the convention and the nomination of the APC were conducted should be seen as the affirmation of the spirit of fairness and openness with which the 2023 general elections will be conducted.\n\nAccording to the statement, Buhari, who thanked Nigerians for their support for the APC in 2015, and 2019, said he had a rich experience in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 presidential elections, travelling to all the 774 local councils in the country, and in 2019 visiting 36 states.\n\nHe said if Nigerians knew what other African countries were passing through, they would be grateful to God as he assured that his administration was doing its best to tackle security challenges.\n\nThe President prayed that God would give him more strength and wisdom to protect the people and fulfill his promises.\n\nBuhari further said: \u201cThey say he who wants to serve should be ready for the responsibility of leadership. Three times I wanted this position and three times I ended up at the Supreme Court. For that reason, in terms of experience, I have gathered a lot. I visited 774 local councils in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI feel privileged that Nigerians elected me in 2015. Since then, we have been doing our best to tackle the challenges, with God helping us. We are not alone. If only we knew what other countries in Africa are passing through, we will be grateful to God, and protect our country. Other African countries are passing through a lot.\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we are doing our best, and will keep doing our best to improve the situation. I am praying that the Almighty God will give us more strength and wisdom to protect our people, and fulfill our promises of ensuring wellbeing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said his administration would keep doing its best to address the concerns on security, which the Emir of Katsina and Governor Aminu Bello Masari highlighted in their remarks.\n\n\u201cI have heard all that the Governor and Emir have to say on what people expect from government. I will not add anything. I am the one receiving the orders. I will continue to do my best,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State thanked the President for his foresight in closing the borders across the country to promote local production of food, which led to self-sufficiency.\n\nUsman, in his remarks, made four demands to the President: the immediate implementation of the Cancer Research Center which had been appropriated for by the federal government; the commissioning of the Rimi windmills as promised by the Minister of Power two years back and the resumption of work on Katsina-Kano dual carriage way and the Kano-Maradi rail track.",

          "title": "In Nigeria, refining oil costs more than human lives (Part One) The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "Rivers and Delta are two of the nine oil-producing states in the Niger Delta. Like in many instances, oil exploration and the situation of refinery have unleashed environmental catastrophe on oil bearing communities. This investigation by Special Correspondent Gabriel Ogunjobi, digs into year of unresolved injustice of oil spills in the oil producing areas and what many observers see as the health impacts and economic sabotage resulting from oil exploitation.\n\nTHE AFFLICTED PEOPLE OF OGONI CLEAN-UP\n\nFriday Kpeloi, seated with his arms folded, was quiet in the midst of his two colleagues as they narrated how their land, water and atmosphere were contaminated by oil pollution. The other two top activists of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) were Lazarus Tamana and Pastor Christian Lekova Kpandei. The movement\u2019s pioneer, Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa was hanged by General Sani Abacha with eight other activists in 1995 despite international outcry. They had sought justice for their people who suffered the consequences of crude oil mining in Nigeria.\n\nDescribed as the world\u2019s second worst environmental catastrophe after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the Ogoni communities split across Eleme, Gokana, Kana and Tia Local Government Areas of Rivers State were over flooded in 1970 by oil following the corrosion of the Trans-Niger pipelines owned by the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation (SPDC).\n\nAlthough the clean-up of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster caused by the same international oil giant is a done deal Ogoniland remains saturated in sticky residue of oil;the aquatic habitat still polluted, vegetation dried up and human lives strangled by the effects of this unending depletion.\n\nSuccessive spills between 2008 and 2009 from defective Shell pipelines led to another massive contamination in Bodo. The Ogoni people accused Shell of late responses to the developments, leaving oil to pump into the creeks for over two months.\n\nWhile the legal battle instituted by the law firm Leigh Day, against Shell in a London court was still going on, the oil giant agreed to a compensation package of \u00a355m for 15,600 Nigerian fishermen and Bodo community. It was the first time compensation would be paid over an oil spill in Nigeria.\n\nKpeloi followed developments at home from the United States where he lived at the time; reading articles, including some written by Saro Wiwa himself, and phoning his kinsmen settled home. The news was not always pleasant. One particular triggering instance was when Saro Wiwa led the Ogoni people in a non-violent protest to demand clean-up of their indigenous land. They banished Shell activities across Ogoniland. In 1995 however, nine of these activists were charged with incitement and murder.They were subsequently sentenced to death by hanging.\n\nThe murder of the Ogoni Nine,as Saro-Wiwa and his comrades were called,sparked an undying resolve to tackle the government and oil giants both home and abroad.The United Nations soon took notice of the situation and joined in the crusade for the clean-up of Ogoni.\n\nOgoni in the diasporas felt the urge to return home. Tamana, for example, returned from the UK and Kpeloi from the US, to become frontline fighters.\n\n\u201cBut I am not back home to finally settle\u201d Kpeloi told me, insisting that he would return to the US once the struggle was over.\n\nHis hometown, Kegbara Dere, near Bodo, bears no sign of development, apart from the tarred road that leads to the oil manifold station. The locals are disconnected from the power grid because the transformer is non-functional.\n\nBut this is the least of their problems. After the manifold station was blown up during the 1967 civil war, floods brought the still-flowing oil beyond the manifold spill area to farms, acres of mangroves, and the creeks that sustained most of the riverine area of Kegbara Dere.\n\nAlso, when oil was spilled from Bodo pipelines \u2013 transporting crude through the sea into the edge of Bonny Island for offshore refining \u2013 their shared waterfront was contaminated. The creek water still clots with oil in some places even till now.\n\nThe two communities are like Siamese twins; same breath, same death. For more than six decades, the people of these two communities have been firsthand victims of the impacts of oil contamination.\n\nWhen some natives of Bodo were compensated, Kegbara Dere was exempted and Kpeloi vows he will fight the injustice.\n\nIronically,Kpeloi himself has become a victim of the story.\n\nIn late 2021, began to experience difficulty in breathing. \u201cWhen the cough was getting severe, I decided to visit the hospital for a check-up in November last year,\u201d says the activist, with a quaint English accent. He brought out a paper from his chest pocket, reading the doctor\u2019s diagnosis: \u201cChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.\u201d\n\nAs if to prove that he was struck with the illness in Nigeria, he tried to look for another piece of paper. The paper, as he would later find, was a sheet from the 263-page report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) over Ogoniland pollution in 2011.\n\nThe report revealed that benzene, a known carcinogen, was detected in all air samples at concentrations ranging from 0.155 to 48.2 \u03bcg/m3. Approximately 10 per cent of detected benzene concentrations in Ogoniland were higher than the concentrations WHO and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) report as corresponding to a 1 in 10,000 cancer risk. Many of the benzene concentrations detected in Ogoniland were higher than those measured in more economically developed regions around the world.\n\nKegbara Dere, for instance, experienced a series of spills between 1990 and 2009 at the Bomu manifold area owned by Shell. In April 2009, there was a fire following an oil spill on the Trans-Niger Pipeline, which transports over 120,000 barrels per day through Ogoniland. Although Shell claimed to have completed two remediation projects in the Bomu manifold area in the past, most of the manifold area was still covered in oily residues, soot and ash.\n\nUNEP\u2019s findings confirmed that some 9,000 square metres of the manifold area are heavily polluted, the concentration of oil on the surface being above saturation, resulting in an oily sheen on pools of standing water and a strong oily smell.\n\nThe highest soil contaminations, at 63,600 mg/kg TPH, were found in the top 0.60 metres of a borehole in the most heavily contaminated area directly bordering the southernmost part of the manifold. This is extremely high and is far above the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Industry in Nigeria (EGASPIN) intervention value of 5,000 mg/kg.\n\nThe 70-year-old Kpeloi is not only nursing a terminal illness, he is bereaved.His younger brother died at the age of 68 of an undisclosed illness early this year. Yet, Kpeloi is optimistic of pulling through to fight for justice.\n\n\u201cThere are cases that went on for seven, eight years before justice,\u201d Kpeloi.\n\nBesides compensation in some quarters across Ogoniland, the agreement with the Shell companies included clean-up of all polluted areas. \u201cBut as far as I am concerned, clean-up has not started. What they are doing is crude and ridiculous,\u201d Tamana declared.\n\nIn 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari announced a $1bn restoration fund for the pilot clean-up project.\n\nPastor Christian Lekova Kpandei, a decoder with Amnesty International, is at the frontline of monitoring oil spills. He holds the oil corporations accountable towards clean-up. In 2016, he had an experience that shook his conviction.\n\n\u201cWhilst I was tracking the patterns of the spills in the creeks, the Army arrested and detained me for two weeks,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cSince then, I told myself there is no point dying for nothing while some people are in the cities enjoying the wealth. The striking questions are these: How do these people know where to burst? How do they transport the contents when the entire Ogoniland is militarised? They are aided by the military.\u201d\n\nChristian benefited from the paltry N600,000 compensation but the remaining part of the bargain, which is restoring their farmlands remains untouched. The creek at Bodo is polluted by oil directly flowing into it, killing the mangroves where fishes used to lay eggs.\n\nIn January 2015, Shell admitted responsibility for the Bodo spills, pledging to compensate the people and clean up Bodo Creek. Whilst Bodo residents have since received the compensation, clean-up is haphazardly done, this investigation can confirm. Apart from residents\u2019 allegation that the contractors were using simple tools such as shovels to sand-fill spill sites, satellite imagery views from 2006 till 2020 showed no signs of Bodo environmental restoration.\n\nThe Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses showed that the coastal fringes of Bodo were still occupied by mangrove vegetation and appeared healthy, resembling a community of short water plants on the river surfaces as of 2006.\n\nBut the continued oil spill in the community disrupted this ecosystem. After the 2009 oil spill disaster in the area, the contaminants progressively weakened the integrity of the swamp vegetation. Bodo swamp in 2013 became less vegetative, losing its appearance of dense shrub-like assemblage. The combination of oil spill and the mangrove vegetation forms a black, brown and green texture on the surfaces thereby compromising the health of the swap ecosystem.\n\nBy 2020, sparse plants and trees rising from dark coastal soil suggest that Bodo is still not completely rid of oil contaminants\n\nApart from Bodo and Kegbara Dere, this reporter confirmed that many other communities outside Nigeria\u2019s Ogoniland are still battling the ripples of oil contamination. For example, all the pipe borne water plants in Bori, Khana LGA were shut down because of suspected contamination.\n\nNot only that, the wide stretch of riverine area near an old oilfield in Goi is soaked in oil, with earth crust sinking in the blackish abyss. The oil residue renders the entire land useless.\n\nSTILLBIRTH, SOOT IN RIVERS\n\nDespite the controversy dogging the Ogoniland clean-up, the environmental pollution in Rivers State is worsened by illegal oil bunkering in the state. The consequence of this is illegal artisanal refining of stolen oil, which in turn leads to the release of carbon black or \u2018soot\u2019 into the ecosystem. From one creek to the other, flares envelop many parts of the state which is about 60 per cent landmass and turns a bright morning day into evening. The cloud is misty as if rain is imminent. When it does rain, the water is not potable and often comes as acid rain.\n\nIn Port Harcourt especially, homes are rarely painted white these days because their walls are stained with the soot. The windows in urban settlements of Rumuodara and Rumuokoro in the capital city are coated by deposits of soot and the nostrils of the dwellers release black fluids whenever they sneeze.\n\nPius Dukor, a socio-political commentator based in the state\u2019s capital, recalled how he lost his voice for more than seven days after inhaling the thick soot. The choking smoke, he said, seized his breath but luckily spared his life at the end.\n\nRegina is one of the victims of the soot problem. The mid-40-years\u2013old woman, who hailed from Bodo, a 30-minute drive from Port Harcourt, recounted her stillbirth experience in 2013. She sells periwinkles for a living in the oil-rich state but because Bodo shores have become toxic for aquatic creatures, Regina would paddle a canoe far to Bonny to pick periwinkles where the water is relatively fresh.\n\nPregnant women like Regina were advised to keep off from the shores to reduce the health risk on their babies. \u201cBut I was always going to the shores to pick periwinkles so I lost my baby,\u201d she says. \u201cI was feeling a sharp stomach pain that evening in 2013 and at the same time bleeding until I was rushed to the clinic.\u201d\n\nUN experts have opined that the environmental restoration of Ogoniland may take at least 25 years, adding that all sources of ongoing contamination, including the artisanal refining must be stopped before the clean-up of the creeks, sediments and mangroves can begin.\n\nLately, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike made efforts to stop oil bunkering. He demanded a comprehensive list of illegal refineries and their operators across the 23 LGAs and also promised the disbursement of N20 million to each of the 23 local council chairmen ready to clampdown on the illegal refineries in their creeks.\n\nOIL REFINING OR RENEWABLE ENERGY?\n\nAt various quarters, there are conversations that artisanal refining, though illegal, is bridging the gap for the demands of petroleum products. Government, on the other hand, is pushing for the establishment of modular refineries to halt illegal refineries, an alternative to keep the oil market afloat. But that is half of the story. From inception, refining oil in Nigeria has come at great cost with government losing billions of naira to rehabilitate ailing refineries. Also, oil production has far-reaching public health risks for the communities hosting the government-owned refineries or the pipelines.\n\nFor the first time in 43 years of operation, the NNPC published an audited financial report in 2020. In 2018 alone, the report revealed that the refineries incurred a total loss of N154 billion, with the Port Harcourt refineries alone losing N45.59 billion. But this huge loss was not even for rehabilitation but administrative maintenance including paying workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nIn 2021 alone, the NNPC spent N100 billion on the rehabilitation of the nation\u2019s four refineries in 2021, with nothing to show for it.. The PHRC is made up of two refineries, located at Alesa Eleme near Port Harcourt with a jetty (for product import and export). The jetty is located 7.5km away from the refinery complex.\n\nFor the communities on the fence lines of these Port Harcourt refineries, their consquences are the spilled oil cloaking farmlands and killing their farm yields. The wastewaters from the PHRC are often not properly disposed of, ultimately contaminating residents\u2019 source of drinking water. For instance, at Ekerikana community where the Port Harcourt Refinery discharges effluents into their river, the people complain that the underground water emits oil odour and becomes harmful when used domestically. It is not exactly different from the spill from the NNPC product pipeline that runs through Nisisioken Ogale in Eleme around 2005. The groundwater was found contaminated with benzene, a known carcinogen, and the presence of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). The benzene concentration was at levels over 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) standards. MTBE is not a part of crude oil but an additive added to refined products at the refinery. Its presence proved that the spill was not from the crude oil but that of a refined product, which the NNPC was directly responsible for.\n\nDELTA, NIGERIA: A LOST HERITAGE\n\nThe Warri refinery is hosted in the sprawling neighbourhood of Ifiekporo and Ubeji communities. From the tank farm, international and local oil companies ferry the vessels on the Atlantic front in Delta offshore for refined oil.\n\nLiving on the fence line of a refinery in Nigeria is characterized by one thing in Delta: an untamed rage gravitating towards militancy. Apart from the greenery along the same paths with pipelines, what oil-rich Warri represents needs no telling. There is crude everywhere; the nose perceives its smells seeping from the nooks and crannies, as if the whole place would be in flames if there was any spark. There are traces of oil in the Ifiekporo creeks but it is difficult to trace the source on foot.\n\nWhere is the smell oozing from? Certainly, not from the tank farm. Whether or not the land was of tranquillity or militancy will manifest in a bit.\n\nFlashback to the days of yore. Warri was the nerve of the state\u2019s economy, dubbed as the oil city. Its prominence in Nigeria\u2019s south is only surpassed by Ogoni\u2019s Rivers state, bearing the same natural resource but in larger quantities. The thing about Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is that the moment it came, it overrode the nation\u2019s existing priority. The country\u2019s economy and the citizens are yet to recover from the effect; Nigeria tarnished agriculture, especially cocoa and palm oil farming, which was the economic mainstay for the new bride (crude oil).\n\nWarri had attracted the fortune of oil multinationals, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), and the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Company (WRPC), the youths flourished and the city got boisterous. Alas, a dangerous trend hit the oil city many years later.\n\nBefore noon on March 30, I arrived at the tank farm, still looking for the source of the oil smell. A friendly soldier ushered me to the sight of the berthed ships waiting for the vessels to be loaded. There was a tailback of tankers clogging the vicinity.The soldier tells me \u201cthe traffic is still subtle this time\u201d.\n\nAs I moved a few miles out of the tank farm, I caught the sight of some teenagers and young adults breezing in and out of the creeks that led to the waters. Their bodies were dripping black oil. Behind the shelters where they came from on canoes with blue plastic barrels on canoes were swamps. Away from the waterside, they loaded the heavy barrels onto the truck beds.\n\nSuch bunkerers litter the creeks around the oil refinery and the tank farms. Some other times, they tap directly into pipelines away from oil company facilities, and connect from the pipes to barges that are hidden in small creeks with mangrove forest cover. They pollute the water bodies while transporting stolen crude oil to the illegal refining sites where they \u2018cook\u2019 the oil and flare soots into the atmosphere in the process.\n\nSoot is a threat to public health but no one in the community was willing to talk to me about the impacts of this oil theft.\n\nOil theft in Delta is an organized crime of sea pirates whose history hacks back to the Warri crisis of 1997 and 2003.. By 2003, the gun-toting non-state actors and the Nigerian navy clashed over illegal oil bunkering. They use the waterways to transport arms into the country, intimidating oil workers on the sea and also hijacking their vessels.\n\nThis was how Delta deteriorated over the years by prolonged violence. Because of oil.\n\nOil multinationals such as Shell, Chevron, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, and its subsidiaries, and other ancillaries and servicing companies, now lay supine. And in the mid-2000s, they fled the city in droves. Shell initially downsized in the mid-2000s through SoFu (Securing our Future) initiatives, and later shut down its operation in Warri, a development that threw the state into turmoil. Oil production was severed because flow stations were attacked by non-state gunmen.\n\nChevron also closed its onshore facilities, and then its main export terminal at Escravos. Both Shell and Chevron declared force majeure-an inability to fulfil their obligations due to events beyond their control on Nigerian exports.\n\nHuman Rights Watch concluded that the Warri crisis was a classic example of a \u201cresource war\u201d, connected to the oil bunkering around the Escravos River and other oil fields.\n\nFor Delta, the joy of oil was short lived. Oil activities shrank but the business of oil criminality grew rapidly and pollution exacerbated, owing to both unscrupulous activities of oil companies and oil theft such as I witnessed in Ifiekporo.",

Arrest should be made in any case of someone seeing carry APP party agents tags.\u201d\n\n09:35am\n\nIragbiji, Ede Residents Troop out to Vote under Tight Security\n\nThe residents of Iragbiji in Boripe Local Government area of Osun and Ede trooped out in large numbers as early 6.30 a.m, eager to cast their votes amidst tight security in the Saturday governorship election.\n\nIragbiji is the home town of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, who is seeking reelection on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), while Ede is the home town of his main opposition, Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the 2022 Osun governorship election, according to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), is taking place in all the 30 local government areas of the state with 3,763 polling units and 332 registration areas.\n\nThe 15 political parties\u2019 candidates participating in the election include: Mr Oyegoke Omigbodun, Social Democratic Party (SDP); Dr Akin Ogunbiyi (Accord); Mr Yusuf Lasun (Labour Party); Munirudeen Atanda (Action Democratic Party) and Busuyi Ayowole of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP).\n\nAt Iragbiji, voters were seen in large numbers at their polling units, as early as 7.00 a.m, waiting for the arrival of ad hoc staff of INEC to commence accreditation and voting.\n\nAt Polling Unit 2 Ward 2, Iragbiji Town Hall, the voters were already stationed at the unit in readiness to cast their vote.\n\nAlso, at about 7.30 a.m, voters were seen at Polling Units 7, Opposite WEMA Bank and Polling Unit 6, Osolo Hall, both in Ward 2, to check their names on the pasted INEC voters registers.\n\nThe same scenario played out at Unit 2, Ward 1, LA Primary School, Popo, where voters were being educated by INEC ad hoc staff on how to check their names on the pasted voter register, advising them to conduct themselves in orderly manners.\n\nThe voters were equally admonished not to sell their votes.\n\nThe INEC Presiding Officer, Valentine Awoegbe, also advised the political parties\u2019 agents, election observers and the media to cooperate with the INEC staff, while performing their duties for a hitch-free poll.\n\nThere were large numbers of security personnel manning strategic locations in the two major towns to ensure hitch-free conduct of the election.\n\nRestriction of vehicular movement was, however, not noticed in the town as commercial motorcyclists were seen operating freely within the town early in the day before the commencement of voting.\n\nIn Ede and its environs, eligible voters were seen rushing to their various polling units as early as 6.30 a.m in readiness to participate in the governorship election amidst tight security.\n\nNAN correspondent, who went round the community reported that many voters were already at their polling units as early as 7.00 a.m, awaiting the arrival of the electoral officers.\n\nThere was large presence of security personnel manning strategic locations in the town, while some were seen patrolling the major roads to ensure normalcy at about 6:45 a.m.\n\nAlso, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members, who would serve as INEC ad hoc staff, were seen in buses conveying them to their various polling units and wards.\n\nAt Ward 2, Unit 9, Abogunde area, where Adeleke, the PDP candidate, is expected to cast his vote, voters were already waiting for the commencement of the election.\n\nAlso, at Ward 1, Unit 4, Atapara area, voters were seen in large numbers making arrangements for the arrival of INEC officials.\n\nINEC officials started arriving at their locations by 7.00 a.m.\n\nSpeaking, Mr Akinwumi Olaniyi said the election would be peaceful, looking at the level of preparedness of INEC and the heavy presence of security personnel.\n\nAlso, Miss Abigal Ayoade, on her way to the polling unit, appealed to the electorate not to take laws into their hands, but rather ensure they obeyed all the regulations set aside by the electoral officers.\n\nIn Ile-Ife, there was large turnout of residents of the ancient city heading towards their polling units to vote.\n\nThere was massive deployment of security agencies to different locations in the town.\n\nMany eligible voters trooped to their polling units as early as 7.30 a.m to ensure that they cast their votes early.\n\nAt L.A Primary School, Ilode Ward 11, Unit 007, election materials were on ground in readiness for accreditation and voting.

At Ward 02, Unit 7, Oke-Bode in Atakumosa West Local Government, INEC officials and security operatives arrived as early as 7am with election materials and set up immediately.\n\nOlakunle Muhammed, a residents of Osunjela commended electoral Officials for their early arrival. At Ward 02, Unit 7, Oke-Bode in Atakumosa West Local Government, INEC officials and security operatives arrived as early as 7am with election materials and set up immediately.\n\nOlakunle Muhammed, a residents of Osunjela commended electoral officials for their early arrival.\n\n09:15am\n\nTight Security as Voters Troop Down to Polling Units\n\nYinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nAs over 1.5 million Osun voters are out today to elect the next Governor of Osun State, voters were seeing at the polling centers struggling to retrieve their names in a peaceful manner before the commencement of accreditation at Ode-Omu, Oogi town in Ayedaade Local government area of the State.\n\nHowever accreditation commenced at 8.30am with security beefed up in all the polling stations accross the state with the presence of personnel of Civil Defence Corps, Army, police and other security agencies.\n\nElectoral officers at Ward 10, Unit 13, Egbedore Local Government Area of Osun state are also ready for commencement of voting.\n\nMeanwhile THISDAY noticed large turnout in most of the polling stations.\n\nAt St David Anglican Middle School,Ode-Omu, accreditation commenced without any problem. Voters conducted themselves well.\n\n09:04am\n\nVoters at their polling units\n\n07:10am\n\nOyetola, Adeleke Go Head to Head as Osun State Votes\n\n*PDP claims APC planning to rig election\n\n*INEC promises free, fair poll\n\n*Police deploy 21,000; NSCDC positions 11,226 men\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nAfter weeks of acrimonious campaigns, the people of Osun State will today decide whether Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) should continue for another four years or elect a new man to succeed him.\n\nFifteen political parties are fielding candidates for today\u2019s election, but it is evidently a straight fight between Oyetola and Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThis would be the second time the two candidates would be meeting. Both Oyetola and Adeleke contested for the Osun governorship position in 2018, which Oyetola won after a rerun.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured the people of a free and fair poll and spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the 332 registration areas across the 30 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe election umpire restated its readiness to announce the result in less than 12 hours after the poll.\n\nThe two leading political parties are desperate to win today\u2019s contest to signpost readiness to dominate the 2023 elections.\n\nTo underpin the importance of the poll, the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu led a final campaign for Oyetola last Tuesday. He was accompanied by party chieftains like the party\u2019s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima and several APC governors.\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar also led a powerful campaign team to the state on Thursday assuring the people that Adeleke is sure of victory in the poll, and that \u201can end has come to the reign of the ruling APC\u201d in the country.\n\nAtiku was accompanied by the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; Vice-presidential candidate of the party and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and some governors of the PDP.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across Osun State, with voters bitterly divided among the two leading candidates.\n\nFear of violence was palpable, considering the rancorous campaigns before the poll.\n\nThe allegations by the PDP that the APC was working to rig the poll dominated discussion across the state.\n\nPolice Deploy 21,000 Operatives\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has assured Nigerians that today\u2019s poll would be violence-free.\n\nBaba, who spoke last Tuesday, said to accomplish the task, no fewer than 21,000 operatives would be deployed across the state.\n\nBaba warned that the police would not allow any person or group of persons, no matter how highly and lowly placed in the society to derail the electoral process, and vowed that \u201cvote-buying or any form of inducement would not be allowed as they remained serious offences.\u201d\n\nThe IG adds: \u201cThe police will be deployed to protect the facilities of INEC and its personnel. This deployment is not meant to intimidate any law-abiding citizens; rather it is to deter misguided elements that may threaten the conduct of the election and violate the electoral act. It also serves as a strong warning that government is determined to protect the citizens.\u201d\n\nThe IG has also deployed the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department, DIG Johnson Kokumo, for the governorship election.\n\nAlso deployed to the state are four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.\n\nBaba also moved the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode (temporarily) to the Force Headquarters until the conclusion of the election.\n\nNSCDC deploys 11,226\n\nSimilarly, the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi, has deployed 11,226 officers and men to cover the 3,763 polling units, collation centres, flash points, as well as critical national assets and infrastructure during today\u2019s poll.\n\nThe deployed personnel were drawn from the national headquarters and nine state commands; Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi and Edo to supply manpower for the election.\n\nThe NSCDC said the objectives of the corps in the election were to create a secured environment for its successful conduct and enhance the general security in the state before, during and after the election.\n\nOyetola and Adeleke\n\nThe leading candidates for today\u2019s poll remain Oyetola and Adeleke.\n\nOyetola, who is seeking reelection for a second term, enjoys the privileges that come with being incumbent. He is also enjoying the perks of \u2018federal might\u2019 and the backing of Tinubu.\n\nHis chances in today\u2019s poll has been brightened by his good relationship with Osun civil servants. Unlike his predecessor who owed salaries for months, Oyetola has been consistent with salary payment and also improved the welfare of the civil servants. All of these, pundits argue, will work in his favour.\n\nHowever, the cold war between Oyetola and Rauf Aregbesola, his predecessor, may reduce the former\u2019s votes in LGAs controlled by the latter.\n\nThe disharmony within the party left it with factions \u2013 the Ileri Oluwa group is loyal to Oyetola while TOP pledges allegiance to Aregbesola.\n\nNotwithstanding, Oyetola stands a very good chance of getting a second term today.\n\nAdeleke, the \u201cdancing senator\u201d, says he is determined to recover his \u201cstolen mandate\u201d from the APC. He is in the race with a big war chest. He also has a broad support base.\n\nA lot of people from Adeleke\u2019s Osun West Senatorial District, which is yet to produce a governor since the fourth republic, are agitated. Adeleke will gain from this, but may not be enough to make him governor.\n\nThe crisis in Osun PDP may also affect Adeleke\u2019s chances. The party is also divided into factions. One is recognised by the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) while the other is backed by Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former governor of the state, whose political sway in the state cannot be overlooked.\n\nStrengths on Senatorial Basis\n\nOyetola looks good to win Osun Central where he is from. Besides, many prominent Osun political stakeholders are from this senatorial zone, and they belong to the APC. They include former governor, Chief Bisi Akande and the current Senator, Ajibola Basiru, who is also the Oyetola campaign chairman. Osun Central is good-to-go for Oyetola.\n\nAdeleke is from Osun West, with Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party. Here, Adeleke will have an upper hand, but not enough to make him governor. Oyetola will still get substantial votes here.\n\nIn Osun East, Adeleke will benefit greatly from the influence of Francis Fadahunsi, the Senator representing the area, who is a PDP member. Oyetola\u2019s good performance during his first term will give him victory in Osun East.\n\nINEC Chairman Charges Staff on Good Conduct\n\nThe Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu yesterday charged the staff of the Commission to remain neutral and repeat the transparent conduct exhibited in Ekiti State governorship election four weeks ago.\n\nIn a statement he signed, the INEC chairman, said: \u201cExactly 27 days ago, we conducted and concluded the Ekiti Governorship Election that was widely adjudged to be free, fair, credible, and inclusive.\n\n\u201cThe feat was happily an elongation of the earlier successes recorded in Edo and Ondo states on 15th September and 10th October 2020, and in Anambra State on 6th November 2021. The sheer determination, resilience, and competence displayed by all of you, our members of staff, made it possible for the Commission to achieve these lofty goals.\u201d\n\nHe reminded the staff of the commission of the need to maintain the same impartial conduct exhibited in the other states.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cI have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun State that the Commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety.\n\n\u201cThe people of Osun State and Nigerians will understandably hold us to our promise on election day. They will observe our attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls. They will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of commitment and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour. You must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.\u201d\n\nPDP Claims APC Planning to Rig Election\n\nThe PDP yesterday alleged an orchestrated plot by the APC \u201cto derail the nascent democratic process by compromising the integrity and sabotaging the will and desire of the people for a free, fair, transparent and credible electoral process\u201d in today\u2019s election in Osun State.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba alleged that the APC had accentuated its rigging programme by deploying billions of naira to compromise some security and electoral officers to intimidate voters, manipulate electoral process and inordinately favour Oyetola, against the will of the people.\n\nThe PDP alleged that huge money had been funneled to certain compromised security and INEC officials \u201cto execute this ignoble scheme.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cthe said INEC and security officials are reported to have been bought over to, among other things, criminally assist and provide cover for APC agents to prosecute a well-oiled vote buying and violence-triggering scheme.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba adds. \u201cOur Party has information on how two prominent APC governors from the South-west, a former APC National Chairman from the South-south, certain federal minister and a particular member of the House of Assembly from Lagos State are coordinating the release of billions of naira to bribe electoral and security officials, as well as fund heavily armed thugs imported from Lagos, Ondo, Ogun and other South-west states to unleash violence and help the APC to rig the election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said that it had however been made aware that some patriotic INEC and Police officials vehemently rejected the poisonous offer by the APC.\n\nThe PDP called on the IG and Yakubu \u201cto take immediate decisive steps to check the activities of police and INEC officials deployed to Osun State so as to avert a breakdown of Law and Order, especially given the manifest determination of the people of Osun State to resist the APC on its evil scheme.\u201d",

PDP first issued the quit notice in December last year when this present leadership assumed office.\n\n\u201cThis election was a referendum on the disastrous APC stewardship, and proves conclusively that Nigerians want PDP back. And, indeed, PDP is coming!\n\n\u201cThe task before us now is to transit from Opposition to Governance. This we shall do. With Osun done, next villa!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe call on all PDP members and all Nigerians to join the moving PDP train. Don\u2019t be left behind. Our next destination is ASO VILLA.\u201d\n\nAyu commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security operatives for \u201ctoeing the path of neutrality and ensuring that the votes counted\u201d.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Earlier on Friday, many African fintech startups offering virtual dollar card services sent emails to their customers stating that their virtual card service will be unavailable indefinitely starting Saturday, July 16, 2022. Virtual cards are digital replicas of physical bank cards. They are created and stored within digital virtual wallets.\n\nAn email sent to Barter customers by Nigerian-born unicorn Flutterwave read, \u201c\u2026effective Sunday, 17th July 2022, all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases.\u201d The payments giant attributed the reason for this suspension to \u201can update from the company\u2019s card partner\u201d. Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Meet Burna Boy's monitor engineer, Precious Tawo as he takes us on his journey into sound engineering",
          "text": "Today\u2019s guest on Everyday People is someone whose magic you\u2019ve probably experienced at any Burna Boy, Wizkid, or Fireboy DML\u2019s concerts. Without further ado, let\u2019s meet Precious Tawo, freelance sound engineer and production manager. He has worked with firms like Google, IBM, and MultiChoice, and is a die-hard perfectionist, perhaps in recovery. He also runs Decibelz Production Limited, a one-stop-shop for all your audio rental needs.\n\nThere\u2019s this saying my sister made all of us get used to, which is still on my email address now:\n\nGood, better, best.\n\nI will never rest,\n\nUntil my good is better\n\nAnd my better best\n\nWe grew up singing that. We always lived by that mantra.\n\nSo I kept on putting my best into what I was doing. Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019. I also have some people I mentor, all so I can give back.\n\n*Average dollar to naira to rates in February 2014.\n\n**Dollar to naira rate in November 2013.\n\n***Average dollar to naira rates in 2013.",

So, we need the cooperation, collaboration, support and the buy in of everybody.\n\n\u201cGovernment cannot do it alone. So, we need everybody, I want you to know that government is committed to bringing everybody on board.\n\n\u201cSo, people are welcome to blow the whistle, to make sure that we destroy and tackle corruption,\u2019\u2019 said the minister.\n\nProf. Bolaji Owasanoye, the Chairman, Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), represented by Mrs Anne Odey, a member of the ICPC board, welcomed the initiative.\n\nOwasanoye, who said it would greatly help in the fight against corruption, advised that the platform be made easily accessible, as well create secured and confidential hotlines for informants and the information received.\n\nThis, he said, was necessary to strengthen an ethical environment devoid of victimisation and reprisals.\n\nHe also called for a continuous public enlightenment to ensure sustainability and avoid false and mischievous complaints and reports.\n\nDr Garba Abari, Director-General, National Orientation Agency (NOA), represented by the Director of Press, Mr Paul Odenyi, called on AFRICMIL and Yar\u2019Adua Foundation to extend the whistleblowing platform to election matters.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for us to raise the issue of transactional politics that is denting our elections, people are buying and selling votes as if it is a market place.\n\n\u201cSo if the platform can be used to blow whistle on those who try to corrupt our electoral system like we witnessed during the party primaries and in elections, it will help,\u2019\u2019 Abari said.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Director-General of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Mr Joseph Ari says institutionalising apprenticeship and traineeship will address the high rate of poverty and unemployment.\n\nAri said this on Thursday in Abuja at the Second National Skills programme with the theme, \u201cInstitutionalising Apprecenticiship and Traineeship for National Development\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the increasing rate of unemployment and poverty is a wakeup call for all including ITF, which core mandate is skills development to seek lasting solution.\n\nHe said the choice of this theme was deliberate because of soaring unemployment and poverty in Nigeria and how we can apply apprenticeship in resolving it.\n\n\u201cThis is bearing in mind how well it worked miracles for countries that took that route when they contended with issues such as we are facing now.\u201d\n\nAri said repositioning apprenticeship would help tackle increasing poverty and unemployment as indicated by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe NBS in its Labour Force Statistics, Unemployment and Underemployment Report of Q4 2020, unemployed persons in the economically active or working age, 15 to 65 was 122,049,400.\n\n\u201cOf this number, 69, 675,468 were willing to work, but only 46,488,079 were in paid employment.\n\n\u201cWhat could be inferred from the survey is that more than 23 million Nigerians that were perhaps qualified and willing to work were without jobs.\n\n\u201cIt also shows that the unemployment rate among the youth, 15 to 35 years, was up by eight per cent.\n\n\u201cIt rose from 34.9 per cent to 42.5 per cent, which is the highest among other age groupings within the period under review,\u201d he said.\n\nAri expressed concern that in spite of the high unemployment rate, rather than absence of jobs, vacancies still existed in several sectors.\n\nHe said that a Skills Gap Assessment of six priority sectors revealed that some vacancies could not be filled by Nigerians because of lack of requisite skills.\n\n\u201cThe question that arises from this paradox is, how can we plug these gaps using apprenticeship?\n\n\u201cThe answer to this question can be found in countries such as Germany, China, Australia, USA and others.\n\n\u201cThese countries at various times faced similar challenges such as we are contending with.\n\n\u201cWhat they did was to pour greater investments in skills acquisition and apprenticeship training,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile citing instances of how countries like Germany scaled the hurdle, the director-general said they saw potential in apprenticeship and took advantage of it.\n\n\u201cIn Germany, about two decades ago, there was mass unemployment with roughly five million unemployed people and low employment rates.\n\n\u201cToday, nearly two-thirds of young Germans are enrolled in apprenticeships once they leave full-time education using the German Dual Vocational and educational training (DVT),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEngland in 2009 made concerted efforts to increase the number of apprenticeships to combat youth unemployment by creating National Apprenticeship Service.\n\n\u201cBetween 2009 and 2014, the number of active apprentices in the country doubled from 444,800 to 851,500.\n\n\u201cWhile France in 2020 alone spent more than a billion Euros to boost its apprenticeship programmes.\u201d\n\nAri explained that apprenticeship had been an age-long tradition and an institution in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that it was a common feature in the traditional setting to see people engage in vocations like farming, carving, carpentry, catering, and building among others.\n\nHe, however, expressed concern that the potential of apprenticeship in tackling unemployment and poverty had not been fully actualised in Nigeria.\n\nThe director-general said the traditional apprenticeship, which was still being practised in Nigeria was not viable enough to curb issues of unemployment and other societal problems.\n\nAri said it was in the realisation of the numerous benefits of apprenticeship that ITF took the lead in collaboration with critical stakeholders to ensure its institutionalisation.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for establishing ITF to help harness potential in vocational skills to effect the needed change.\n\nAri said in its fifty years of existence, ITF had pursued its mandate with single-mindedness and vigour.\n\nHe said that ITF had trained more than 22 million Nigerians whose contributions to the growth of the various sectors of the economy could not be quantified.\n\nAccording to him, ITF liaised with a total of 1,353 companies for promotion of in-company apprenticeship activities\n\nbetween 2010 and 2019 alone.\n\nHe stressed that the fund \u201cvisited and appraised 1,146 companies to determine their potential to conduct apprentice training in identified trade areas.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it harmonised 444 existing In-company apprenticeship schemes of companies in line with the ITF National Apprenticeship scheme.\n\n\u201cIt also installed the scheme in 286 companies as well as monitored 831 companies, leading to the training of 36,397 most of whom are gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nThe ITF boss disclosed that the fund was currently working on bringing in skills intervention programmes like National Industrial Skills Development Programme (NISDP).\n\nHe said that Women Skills Empowerment Programme (WOSEP) and Passion to Profession Programme (P2PP) were being considered among others.\n\nAri called on curriculum planners and employers\u2019 associations to design youth apprenticeship programmes among other suggestions.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the programme would provide the platform to articulate strategies for a robust apprenticeship scheme in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, commended ITF\u2019s commitment to creating avenues for dialogue on ways of enhancing skills acquisition.\n\nHe lauded the convening of the programme, saying its theme aligned with efforts by the Federal Government to resolve challenges linked with rising unemployment and poverty.\n\nAdebayo, who was represented by the Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Maryam Katagum, commended ITF for being one of the foremost agencies under the ministry.\n\n\u201cYou may be aware that the Federal Government has through its Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) initiated and implemented a number of programmes.\n\n\u201cProgrammes that have recorded positive results, especially in terms of uplifting the living standards of Nigerians as well as developing national economy.\n\n\u201cWhat government, however, finds worrisome is that although most of our programmes get expected outcomes in terms of jobs created, Nigerians with the requisite skills are lacking,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister assured of the ministry\u2019s commitment to implementing resolutions that would emerge from the summit.\n\nThe Chairman, Oil and Gas Free Zone, Dr Chris Asoluka, said the move toward institutionalising apprecenticiship and traineeship for national development was achievable.\n\nAsoluka, who was the theme paper presenter, urged the director-general of ITF to assemble the best brains and people who shared in his vision, to come up with workable framework.\n\nHe said that a properly planned framework would engender better policy or law that would drive the idea and ensure effective implementation.\n\nMeanwhile, goodwill messages were delivered by the Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development Pauline Tallen and Mr Olawale Fasanya, Director-General, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN).\n\nOther critical stakeholders including the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) and the British High Commission to Nigeria also delivered their goodwill messages.\n\nThey all expressed commitment to working with ITF to upscale job creation while drastically reducing poverty in Nigeria.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the programme which had two plenary sessions had discussants, who spoke on developing functional framework for national apprenticeship and traineeship scheme.\n\nThe discussants also spoke on the issues and prospects of apprenticeship and traineeship scheme in Nigeria.\n\nThe ITF was established by the Federal Government to set and regulate training standards and offer direct training intervention among others (NAN)\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "David Nweze Umahi: The vituperation of a political opportunist",
          "text": "By Ebenezer Oji\n\nDavid Nweze Umahi, governor of Ebonyi State, a maximum ruler who brooks no opposition, loves to listen to himself talk even if he when he has nothing reasonable to say. Clearly, Umahi does not appreciate the limits of his power as an elected leader in a democratic society.\n\nQuite recently, he started facing the worst political crises of his life. His effort to impose Hon. Francis Ogbonnia Nwifuru has not been without resistance from older members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Up till this moment, that matter is yet to be resolved. A faction of the party organized a parallel primary election and elected Engr Elias Mbam, a former Minister of State for Finance and Chairman, Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, as candidate.\n\nIn his usual strange ways, Umahi made a public announcement over two months ago, even before party primaries commenced and told Ebonyians that Nwifuru is the next governor of the state. It didn\u2019t occur to him that it is a democracy and he cannot force down his personal preferences on Ebonyians. After all, not all Ebonyians are in APC.\n\nShortly after this overreach, the party chiefs decided to flog him politically and he is yet to recover from the beating. Last week he reportedly travelled to Kigali, the capital of Rwanda pretending to have gone for medical checks. But according to many accounts, he was there making frantic efforts to see the INEC helmsman who was there for a conference. He is fighting tooth and nail to have his name restored as APC senatorial candidate for Ebonyi South. But he is still failing and chances are that his party may not field anybody because of his greed.\n\nUmahi is yet to recover from his political humiliation at the APC presidential convention. The trailer loads of rice and yams he allegedly evacuated to the 19 Northern states fetched no single vote. A desperate presidential aspirant who sold Ndigbo to those who turned our lands to killing fields by Fulani herdsmen.\n\nHe thought he was the one to be compensated with the presidential slot. He thinks Nigerian politics could be cheapened for him because he was used to being very lucky since he was brought into Ebonyi to join politics. In his recent incoherent rantings, he blamed Ohanaeze and Igbo leaders but forgot to see anything wrong with his own selfish maneuvers which made him decamp from PDP to APC in October, 2020 or his dangerous schemings which led him to undermine/ betray strategic Igbo interests as Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum, a position he had since rendered morribund.\n\nUmahi\u2019s latest attempt to overreach himself occured on Friday, 15th July, 2022 when he addressed Ebonyi Founding Fathers and Elders. He blamed politicians from other zones in Ebonyi state who dared to contest the 2023 Governorship elections. He claimed that only Ebonyi North should be granted the legitimacy to contest, because, according to him, that was the best way to follow the zoning policy in the state. Then he dabbled into his disjointed arguments on the need for equity, justice and fairness.\n\nInfact, he made every effort to incite the Elders against the PDP Guber candidate, Dr Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii, who hails from Ebonyi South Senatorial district.\n\nBut the fact remains that Umahi is being hypocritical. He is a man who thrives in the manipulation of political symbols to achieve his selfish interest. He can go to any length to foist his surrogate on the state so as to continue running the state through his foot-soldiers, outside the corridors of power.\n\nEbonyians are aware that Umahi is trying to cover up his tracks, having privatized the resources of the state for himself and his immediate family.\n\nWho is he to talk about Charter of Equity now? If he meant well for the state, why did he not address the issues before now when he knew the timing would permit such a dialogue and discussion?\n\nThere are many analysts who have argued that since the three zones have had a go at the governorship seat, any one of them can kick-start it now. It was on that basis that the PDP threw their primaries open and nobody was disqualified on the basis of zoning.\n\nSecondly, since 1999 when the issue of zoning came into the political lexicon of the state, it has always been observed through political contest. In 1999, it was Dr. Sam Egwu vs Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu. In 2007, it was Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu vs Chief Martin Elechi. Finally, in 2015, it was Engr David Umahi vs. Arch. Edward Nkwoegu (EDON).\n\nUmahi should watch his statements and spare us any further uprisings, disturbances and deadly tensions. Ebonyians have been sacrificed enough. We need peaceful elections to elect credible leaders who will liberate us from the dungeon he threw us into. Umahi should seek the advice of Elders and be prepared to play by the rules. His immunity does not entitle him to cause trouble during the elections as Ebonyians are prepared to resist his determination to impose his agent on the people.",
          "summary": "By Ebenezer OjiDavid Nweze Umahi, governor of Ebonyi State, a maximum ruler who brooks no opposition, loves to listen to himself talk even if he when he has nothing reasonable to say.\nUmahi is yet to recover from his political humiliation at the APC presidential convention.\nHe blamed politicians from other zones in Ebonyi state who dared to contest the 2023 Governorship elections.\nIn 1999, it was Dr. Sam Egwu vs Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu.\nFinally, in 2015, it was Engr David Umahi vs. Arch.",

          "text": "What is the current level of bilateral relations between Nigeria and Venezuela?\n\nVenezuela and Nigeria this year are marking 56 years of bilateral relationships. We have very strong relations in the multilateral institutions like Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and United Nations institutions. We have very good relations in social areas like the cooperation in scholarship programs from Venezuela to Nigerian students. This manifested in the support to build Hugo Chavez primary school in Jankanwa in Nasarawa state. We work together in the Food and Agriculture\n\nOrganisation and Venezuela has offered technical support to more than 300 Nigerian rice farmers for some years until 2018.\n\nWe have been working together in the last three years despite the impact of the COVID-19 and despite the impacts of the unilateral quasi measures imposed by the United States against Venezuela. We have worked to increase and strengthen the level of bilateral knowledge. We are working in the Joint Meeting to explore other areas such as education, health, agriculture, culture and the economic sector like industry, oil and gas, which have enhanced inter-connectivity between our regions and countries. However,\n\none of the most important challenges is that Africa and Latin America don\u2019t have a direct connection for flights or any other kind of transportation services.\n\nIn the human rights sector, the Ombudsman of Venezuela has interests to start relations with the National Human Right commission of Nigeria. We are also working together in the social, economic, trade, commerce and security areas.\n\nSo, what is the volume of trade between both countries?\n\nIn the area of trade and commerce, unfortunately the level of exchange is very low but we are working with the public and private sectors of Nigeria like NACCIMA, ACIM, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce or Port Harcourt Chamber of Commerce to work in the creation of a bilateral or bi-national business forum.\n\nThe idea is that this meeting be organized this year between the private sector in Venezuela and Nigeria and the public institutions both in the import and export processes. These include different areas like food services, personnel services in order to increase our trade and commerce. If we have direct connection by flights or by ship, we can use that opportunity to increase the level of bilateral exchange in trade and commerce.\n\nAfter the difficult time caused by the pandemic, we are strengthening the capacities between both countries to connect with our people and our nations because we have historic relations. President Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro established a very important base of bilateral relations between Venezuela and Africa in the process to build the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).\n\nAfter the difficult time caused by unilateral quasi measures we are recovering our economic and industrial capacity. Last year, we hit oil production of more than one million barrels per day. Remember we produced between 2 million and 800,000 per day before the sanctions but we fell to around 300,000 barrels per day because of the sanctions promoted by US Presidents; Barrack Obama, Donald Trump and now Joe Biden against Venezuela. The oil, gold Industry of Venezuela was affected so much but from 2021 we are beginning to have an economic recovery.\n\nWe controlled and stopped the hyper-inflation, we established different mechanisms to manage the economy because of the persecutions and sanctions against the Venezuelan Central Bank. Actually the minimum wage today is around $80 per month but before the sanctions the minimum wage was around $300 per month.\n\nNow, we are working to recover to the same level. The social protection system worked very well throughout the most part of the last five or six years of the difficult time of the economy of Venezuela. We recovered the capacity of oil production, we recovered the capacity of refineries of the country and the economy is growing. Last year, we grew more than three percent and for this year Venezuela is working to expand economic capacity.\n\nNigeria has a robust ICT sector. In what ways will you cooperate with Nigeria to promote ICT?\n\nWe can do that in two levels -within our public institutions and also in the private sector to explore the opportunity. Venezuelan ICT sector is very strong and we can explore the capacities and complement each other. Both countries can help each other increase their capacities.\n\nYou talked about direct flights, can you throw more light on this?\n\nOne direct flight from Caracas to Lagos is eight hours. But today, if you have to go from Caracas to Abuja, normally we use Caracas to Istanbul which is 13 hours and then Istanbul to Abuja which is 6 hours, so you spend 19 hours in the flight. The only direct flight between Africa and Latin America is from Addis Ababa to Brazil via Ethiopian airlines.\n\nIf that is the case, why don\u2019t we have direct flights and BASA agreement?\n\nActually, we are in a negotiation to sign that agreement between Venezuela and Nigeria. In Africa for instance, if I need to travel to Benin , I need to pass through Togo. One of the reasons for AfCFTA is the connection between our people and not only free movement of goods. We have COMBIASA as our airlines and we are ready to negotiate with Nigeria to open direct flights from Caracas to Nigeria.",

Technical and legal assistance as well as feasibility studies for projects selected in agreement between InfraCredit and AFD will enable, among others, to support the development of infrastructure projects and job creation,\u201d the statement said.\n\nInfraCredit\u2019s Annuity PPP Guarantee was developed to facilitate the sustainable financing of new infrastructure projects alongside subnational governments in Nigeria. Such eligible projects could benefit fom InfraCredit\u2019s guarantee, which can mobilise up to 20-year local currency financing from the domestic debt capital markets.\n\nSpeaking on the Agreement, chief executive officer of InfraCredit, Chinua Azubike, stated that to date, InfraCredit\u2019s guarantees have enabled the issuance of up to USD266 Million (NGN Equivalent) of local currency infrastructure bonds, of which 61 per cent include PPP projects.\n\nHe however, said that an increasing pipeline of sub-national infrastructure projects requires project preparatory support to deliver well-structured bankable projects that can access the debt capital markets.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration will enable state governments to adopt new funding tools and PPP models that will attract and retain the private sector\u2019s financial incentive to invest in viable infrastructure projects.\n\n\u201cAFD\u2019s technical assistance funding will enable InfraCredit to build deal pipelines of well-prepared state government-supported and private sector- led infrastructure projects to be executed,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the Agreement with InfraCredit, Xavier Muron, Country Director of AFD in Nigeria, noted that \u201cThis \u20ac600,000 grant to Infracredit will finance studies and technical assistance for future infrastructure projects via public-private partnerships throughout Nigeria.

Technical and legal assistance as well as feasibility studies for projects selected in agreement between InfraCredit and AFD will enable, among others, to support the development of infrastructure projects and job creation,\u201d the statement said.\n\nInfraCredit\u2019s Annuity PPP Guarantee was developed to facilitate the sustainable financing of new infrastructure projects alongside subnational governments in Nigeria. Such eligible projects could benefit fom InfraCredit\u2019s guarantee, which can mobilise up to 20-year local currency financing from the domestic debt capital markets.\n\nSpeaking on the Agreement, chief executive officer of InfraCredit, Chinua Azubike, stated that to date, InfraCredit\u2019s guarantees have enabled the issuance of up to USD266 Million (NGN Equivalent) of local currency infrastructure bonds, of which 61 per cent include PPP projects.\n\nHe however, said that an increasing pipeline of sub-national infrastructure projects requires project preparatory support to deliver well-structured bankable projects that can access the debt capital markets.\n\n\u201cThis collaboration will enable state governments to adopt new funding tools and PPP models that will attract and retain the private sector\u2019s financial incentive to invest in viable infrastructure projects.\n\n\u201cAFD\u2019s technical assistance funding will enable InfraCredit to build deal pipelines of well-prepared state government-supported and private sector- led infrastructure projects to be executed,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the Agreement with InfraCredit, Xavier Muron, Country Director of AFD in Nigeria, noted that \u201cThis \u20ac600,000 grant to Infracredit will finance studies and technical assistance for future infrastructure projects via public-private partnerships throughout Nigeria.

We found a good partner from China and this is the contemporary World magazine and it is a very powerful magazine all over the world.\n\n\u201cHere the Nigeria Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution is a very important institute, not only for Nigeria. You know peace, we need peace, we need resolution.\n\n\u201cNigeria, we have serious problems, we have problems of insecurity, China also we have insecurity but mostly from external forces. But in Nigeria we have different insecurity.\n\n\u201cAnd I discuss with the DG how we can do things differently and the good thing is to have symphonies and my idea advocating harmony is to share Chinese harmony, to perform Nigeria-China symphony.\n\n\u201cToday is a very good example of how we can have cooperation between the two most important institutions and try to provide our idea, our approach, and our solution to Nigeria to the African continent, to the whole developing countries.\n\n\u201cSo, I do believe that this is just the beginning and also this is supported by the two governments and I think we can do good things,\u201d Cui said.\n\nDr Bakut Bakut, director-general, IPCR Dr. Bakut Bakut said that the signing of the Chinese Contemporary World Magazine MoU between Nigeria and China is another stride in the already existing good bilateral relations between both countries.\n\nBakut said that with the content of the magazine duly applied, Nigeria will begin to prevent insecurity and spend less on fighting the scourge.\n\n\u201cIt is a magazine, but not just an ordinary magazine that you see on the road. This is an intellectual magazine which is focused on looking at issues that are not sentimental.\n\n\u201cWe look at real issues of governance, International relations, economics, development, poverty eradication, culture, environmental issues.\n\n\u201cSecurity is part of what we are doing. The reason for the Institute of Peace and Conflict Resolution is a preventive agency.\n\n\u201cIf we have enough money to prevent insecurity, there will be no need for the army of police to collect money to resolve the security challenges.\n\n\u201cIn other words, what we are doing, we are a security related agency, and we try to prevent insecurity before it becomes an issue. So this is the purpose,\u201d Bakut said.\n\nBakut explained that aside from being an intellectual magazine, the policies will make an impact across all strata as the IPCR now have zonal offices across the country to implement policies.",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved. The Commission was able to recover 10,659,168 units of various companies\u2019 shares as well as the sum of N1, 384,255,526.73 recovered for investors during the period under review.\n\nIt issued New Rules on Robo-Advisory Services to guide the regulatory requirements and expectations for providing automated advisory services in the market and released the Rules on Trade Repositories during the period under review.\n\nSimilarly, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission also introduced new rules on Crowd Funding, Social bonds, Digital Assets Exchange DAX, Digital Assets Custodians DACs, Issuance of Digital Assets as Securities and Requirements for registration of Digital Assets Offering Platforms as part of its efforts to guarantee security of investments in the capital market.\n\nOn Corporate Governance measures, the Commission also released guidelines on the Implementation of Sections 60-63 of Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and in order to strengthen the disclosure regime in capital market, the Commission in a circular dated January 19, 2022 provided public companies a fast track option for filing Audited Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also developed the SEC Corporate Governance Guidelines SCGG to address corporate governance issues not considered in the NCCG, and released same in October 2020. As part of its efforts to harmonise the reporting timeline of the SEC Corporate Governance Guideline SCGG with that of the National Code of Corporate Governance NCCG, it also in year 2021 exposed to the public for comments an amendment to Rules 42(2).\n\nThe Commission has also as part of its regulatory interventions to amicably resolve disputes between the board and shareholders of listed companies resolved the disputes between Alhaji Muneer Alade Bankole (the Chief Executive Officer and Sheikh Abdulmohsen A. Al-Thunayan Chairman of the Board, of Medview Airlines, resolved those between major shareholders of Ikeja Hotels Plc and returned the company to profitability and also reached a settlement with Oando Plc in 2021 after concluding investigation of Corporate Governance allegations levelled against the company.\n\nIn regard to its market development mandate, the Commission has continued its Investor Education and Public enlightenment programmes by organizing workshops on infusion of Capital Market Studies into the curricula of Basic and Secondary Schools in Nigeria and also collaborated with the Standards Organization of Nigeria SON and other partners to organize Stakeholders\u2019 Sensitization Workshops on Commodities Standards in Lagos and Kano during the period under review.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission held webinars on Non-Interest Capital Market Products, Financial Inclusion, Ponzi Schemes and Solid Minerals targeted at the pension industry, investor protection, women, Youth/millennial and the commodities segment of the market.\n\nAlso in pursuit of non-interest market education and enlightenment programmes, the Commission collaborated with Islamic Financial Services Board IFSB and the Auditing and Accounting Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions AAOIFI to organize Non-Interest Capital Market training for over 1000 participants.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission has led the team to improve the capacity of the Nigerian Capital Market Institute NCMI by providing it with necessary tools to train Capital Market Operators CMO in different fields.\n\nOn international engagements, Mr Yuguda is now saddled with leadership of West African Securities Regulators Association WASRA. Under his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\n\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\n\nAlso, in furtherance of its drive to leverage its operations by deploying innovative technologies and solutions to its departments and units, the Commission conducted a review of its IT infrastructure and determined that it was in a poor state.\n\nThe investigations focused on the internal and external perceptions of the Commission with the conclusion that the IT infrastructure was out dated and needed to be upgraded to international standards of securities regulators.\n\nAlso, on its Risk-Based Supervision Framework Implementation and Capacity Building Project the Commission secured a $400,000 grant from the African Development Bank AfDB to support capacity building projects in the areas of RBS, Derivatives and Green Bonds.\n\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nIn addition, it has also secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN the sum of N3.5 billion for Information Technology transformation project. Given the unparalleled achievements recorded so far, it has been argued by some financial experts that there is nexus between Yuguda\u2019s reforms and investors\u2019 making Nigeria a preferred destination in recent times.",

          "text": "Nearly four years after failing, by a small margin, in his bid to govern Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has overcome the biggest obstacle to his dream.\n\nOn Saturday, he achieved a hard-fought victory over the state\u2019s incumbent Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state\u2019s governorship election.\n\nSenator Adeleke, 62, riding on the back of a campaign aimed at developing the state and retrieving what he says is his stolen mandate, secured 403,371 votes, 28,344 more than his closest rival, the incumbent governor. Governor Oyetola polled 375,027 votes.\n\nIt was enough for the Returning Officer of the election, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, to declare him winner and governor-elect.\n\n\u201cI declare that Adeleke Ademola Jackson Nurudeen of PDP, having satisfied the requirements of the law, is hereby declared the winner and he is returned elected,\u201d Professor Ogundipe declared, sparking jubilation among Adeleke\u2019s supporters.\n\n\ufeff\n\nSaturday\u2019s election featured 15 contestants with the rematch of Oyetola and Adeleke drawing the most attention.\n\nAs the results from the local governments trickled in, it was clear that the election which was generally considered peaceful was a two-horse race between both men.\n\nThey split 96.76 per cent of the total valid votes cast in the election.\n\nKehinde Atanda of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) came in at a distant third with 10,104 votes, followed by Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party with 4,515 votes.\n\nVotes for the other candidates are as follows: Akinade Ogunbiyi, A party \u2014 4,514 votes; Awojide Segun, AAC \u2014 2,148; Kehinde Atanda, ADP -10,104; Awoyemi Lukuman, APM \u2014 1,222; and Adebayo Elisha, APP \u2014 601 votes.\n\nAdeleke Adedapo of BP got 374 votes; Rasaq Saliu, NNPP \u2014 393; Abede Samuel, NRM \u2014 777; Ayowole Adedeji, PRP \u2014 1,007; Omigbodun Akinrinola, SDP \u2014 515; Ademola Adeseye, YPP \u2014 1,303; and Adesuyi Olufemi, ZLP \u2014 364 votes.\n\nVictory At Last\n\nIn the last governorship election held in 2018, it was a tough contest as the APC flagbearer had to win a supplementary election before he was returned elected.\n\nFollowing the initial poll held that year, Oyetola trailed Adeleke who had led by 353 votes going into the supplementary election which held in seven polling units.\n\nThe votes garnered in the supplementary poll would later help the incumbent governor to overturn the deficit and put him ahead of his PDP counterpart, leading to his emergence as the winner of the keenly contested election.\n\nAccording to the final votes announced by the electoral umpire that year, Oyetola polled 255,505 votes while Adeleke scored 255,023 votes \u2013 a difference of 482 votes.\n\nIt was, however, victory at last for the PDP candidate and his supporters on Sunday (today) when he was returned elected by Professor Ogundipe who doubles as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG).\n\nCompared to his loss in the last election, Adeleke bounced back to defeat incumbent Governor Oyetola with a vote margin of 28,344.\n\nBetter Conduct\n\nSaturday\u2019s election started off on schedule at many polling units observed with accreditation and voting going on smoothly for the most part.\n\nSome of the candidates and observers also had words of praise for the conduct of the poll.\n\nGovernor Oyetola told reporters that he is satisfied with the conduct of the poll and commended the security operatives for \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing has been very peaceful,\u201d he said after voting at Unit 2, Ward 1 in Boripe Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cI think INEC has performed very well,\u201d said PDP\u2019s Adeleke after he voted. More than 21,000 policemen had been deployed for the exercise along with three police helicopters and three gunboats.\n\nAhead of the polls, there had been concerns about possible disturbances by cultists and the menace of vote-buying.\n\nHowever, as the exercise progressed, reports from observers and security agents indicated that it was peaceful, backing up assurances by security operatives that adequate arrangements had been made for the poll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to make adequate arrangements to take care of the possible consequences of the activities of the cultists,\u201d said the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the election, Johnson Kokumo.\n\n\u201cThat is, effecting their arrest before the election and of course mopping up light weapons in circulation. This is intended to create a conducive atmosphere where the gubernatorial election will take place without crisis.\u201d\n\nPeaceful Poll\n\nHours into the poll, the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier-General Mohammed Fadah, adjudged the poll peaceful.\n\n\u201cThe place is more peaceful than Ekiti because there isn\u2019t any report of violence,\u201d he told Channels TV\u2019s Seun Okinbaloye when asked about the poll in Osogbo, the state capital.\n\n\u201cEverybody is peaceful like it\u2019s Sallah day, everywhere is peaceful and they are doing their thing in a very peaceful manner. There is no negative report so far.\u201d\n\nIn a preliminary report, the Civil Society Situation Room also adjudged the election as peaceful.\n\n\u201cFrom the Situation Room\u2019s observations, no violence has been recorded and the number of people who came out was encouraging,\u201d it said in another assessment report \u2013 the second for the day.\n\n\u201cWe commend the people of the State of Osun for coming out early to cast their votes, especially the elderly who waited in queues patiently.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to vote-buying, however, the steps taken to combat the act fell short.\n\n\u201cThere was open negotiation of buying and selling of votes well-coordinated by the polling agents in many of the polling units,\u201d the Civil Society Situation Room said in its assessment of the election.\n\n\u201cThere were no complaints from any of them (the polling agents) against each other. Codes were used to extract commitments from voters as opposed to the blatant money exchanging hands observed in the Ekiti State governorship election.\u201d\n\nVote-Buying Still A Problem\n\nCandidates also had concerns about vote-buying.\n\nThe governorship candidate of the Accord Party, Akin Ogunbiyi, told journalists that he witnessed vote buying in Aiyedire Local Government Area.\n\n\ufeff\n\nShortly after casting his vote with his wife at Ile-Ogbo Ward 1, Unit 1, Methodist Primary School, Ogunbiyi listed other areas where vote-buying took place to be in Ile-Ogbo and Osogbo environs.\n\nHe lamented that there was no official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) there to arrest party agents who trade votes for money.\n\n\u201cThe police officers there can\u2019t do any arrest. They were sitting down. In fact, it was by their side that they (voters) were going to collect money for the vote that they sold,\u201d Ogunbiyi said.\n\n\u201cAn Aiyedire Local Government, there was a vehicle parked behind a building. There was a lady inside and there was another man. They were the ones who were exchanging cash for votes.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe candidate of the Labour Party, Lasun Yusuf, also had concerns about vote-buying.\n\nAfter voting at his polling unit in Irepodun LGA around 10:20 am, he had a warning for voters.\n\n\u201cI just have fears for the future generation but let me sound a note of warning, if people actually go out today to buy the votes, Nigeria is in problem,\u201d he said.\n\nAhead of the polls, INEC had said it would work closely with security operatives on the issue of vote-buying. As part of efforts to tackle the menace, various security agencies were present in the state for the poll, including the EFCC.\n\n\u201cWe have our Force Intelligence Bureau operatives; our tactical operatives are here too. They are not in uniforms, they are everywhere, and we are working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC),\u201d Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, told Channels TV during the polls.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe EFCC would later arrest three men for vote buying.\n\nAccording to the anti-graft agency, the three suspects were arrested through actionable intelligence and digital means, and all three will be prosecuted.",
          "summary": "On Saturday, he achieved a hard-fought victory over the state\u2019s incumbent Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state\u2019s governorship election.\n\ufeffSaturday\u2019s election featured 15 contestants with the rematch of Oyetola and Adeleke drawing the most attention.\nFollowing the initial poll held that year, Oyetola trailed Adeleke who had led by 353 votes going into the supplementary election which held in seven polling units.\nAccording to the final votes announced by the electoral umpire that year, Oyetola polled 255,505 votes while Adeleke scored 255,023 votes \u2013 a difference of 482 votes.\nCompared to his loss in the last election, Adeleke bounced back to defeat incumbent Governor Oyetola with a vote margin of 28,344.",

          "text": "Following the attack on Kuje Correctional Centre by terrorists, Nigeria\u2019s Defence Headquarters (DHQ) on Saturday allayed fears of alleged impending attacks on Abuja.\n\nThis is coming as the Brigade of Guards has also set up a board of inquiry to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the Kuje incident and the involvement or otherwise of soldiers posted to the correctional facility on the day of the attack.\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) had issued a security alert on planned terror attacks on churches, schools and public infrastructure in Abuja.\n\nAnother anonymous alert, patterned after standard security alerts which had trended on social media indicated that there was an influx of unknown persons around Karshi Hills and Orozo, in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC).\n\nAccording to the alert, some persons were seen regularly and clandestinely going up the hills around Navy Town Estate thus raising high suspicion that the invaders were building camps within the hills which also connect to other adjoining forests within the FCT and Nasarawa State.\n\nThe alert said the terrorists planned to attack educational institutions located in the area.\n\nBut speaking in Abuja, the Director of Defence Information (DDI), Maj. Gen. Jimmy Akpor said security agencies were on alert and determined to contain any security threats to the seat of power.\n\nHe said: \u201cSecurity agencies are not sleeping. They are doing what needs to be done to keep the place safe. A lot of things are being done. Measures have been put in place. Of all the security agencies, none is sleeping\u201d.\n\nOn the intelligence alert of an impending attack making the rounds, he said expectations were that the citizenry would provide available information to security forces and not circulate such on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, the Brigade of Guards, charged with the security of the president, his family and the seat of power, said it has set up a board of inquiry to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the attack on the Kuje Correctional Centre by Boko Haram and the roles, if any, played by soldiers assigned to the facility.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja Saturday, the Assistant Director of Army Public Relations and Public Relations Officer of the Brigade of Guards, Captain Godfrey Abakpa, said: \u201cThe board of inquiry was set up to ascertain what happened that day to get to the root cause of the attack.\n\n\u201cA board of inquiry has been set up to ascertain what happened that day to get to the root cause of the attack.\u201d\n\nHe said contrary to reports that many soldiers were detained in underground cells, no soldiers were in detention.\n\nHe, however, affirmed that soldiers deployed to that area were responding to the demands of the investigation.\n\n\u201cNobody is being detained. The investigation is ongoing. Everybody is telling his side of the story. It is not our job to guard prisons but we respond in support of civil authority.\n\n\u201cThe board was set up because it happened within our area of responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the security cordon around the seat of power, he maintained that the measures were taken to ensure that the fleeing inmates, who escaped from Kuje and who may be lurking in the shadows were arrested.\n\n\u201cCheckpoints and patrols were ordered because some of the escapees are believed to be still around like the one arrested in the Area 1 Park,\u201d he said.\n\nHe gave the assurance that with the measures in place presently, such an attack would be difficult to come by.\n\n\u201cThere should be no panic. There is the tendency that no such further attack will be possible with the arrangements in place,\u201d he explained.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "title": "With New Status, NNPC GMD\u2019s Nomenclature Now Group CEO",
          "text": "As the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) officially transits to a private entity that would be regulated in line with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), the nomenclature of the Group Managing Director (GMD) of the national oil company would also change to the Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO), in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nThis is coming as Nigeria produced less crude oil in the first six months of 2022 compared with the same period in 2020 and 2021, an analysis of the data on the country\u2019s total oil production from the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), has indicated.\n\nAccording to findings by THISDAY, companies globally take conscious efforts to define how their impact would be measured, ranging from services to relationship management with both the employees and external stakeholders. Under the new status, NNPC Limited would be the holding company.\n\nThe Corporate Affairs Commission on September 21, 2021, completed the incorporation of the NNPC Limited following the provisions of the PIA 2021.\n\nThe PIA was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 16, 2021, following its passage by the National Assembly in July of the same year.\n\nSpecifically, Section 53(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 requires the Minister of Petroleum Resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of the enactment of the PIA in consultation with the Minister of Finance on the nominal shares of the company.\n\nWith the registration by the CAC, NNPC Limited was floated with an initial capital of N200 billion making history as the company with the highest share capital in the country.\n\nSince when the PIA was signed into law last year, the management of the NNPC has taken proactive steps to prepare it for the July 1 take-off as a CAMA company.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari would unveil the new NNPC Limited on July 19.\n\nThe shift in nomenclature from GMD to GCEO implies that going forward, the NNPC subsidiaries would be managed by the GCEO.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that consequently, the GCEO would now be directly responsible for the overall growth of all the subsidiaries and the holding company (NNPC Limited) and the Group CEO being the chief accounting officer is empowered to make decisions in line with established governances by CAMA.\n\nHowever, the title GCEO comes with additional responsibility for measurable performance, upholding the highest level of professionalism and accountability while acting as the company\u2019s representative in all strategic engagements globally.\n\nThis is a significant departure from the way NNPC used to operate as a corporation where most of the major decisions would have to pass through Federal Executive Council (FEC) approvals, among others.\n\nPIA introduced a landmark reform through the creation of NNPC Limited as a commercially focused CAMA entity that would operate without recourse to direct funding from the federal government.\n\nThis was a monumental change expected to reshape the overall industry in Nigeria while serving as a model for other National Oil Companies (NOCs).\n\nIn addition, this change would naturally come with higher expectations in terms of delivering value, greater responsibility for regulatory compliance, active engagement with stakeholders and above all, a scaled sense of accountability in the entire organisation.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the strategic importance of our talent pool in this journey and winning their commitment to delivering the desired results would continue to encourage us to innovate and reorganize the NNPC in a way that will be motivating and rewarding. We would, therefore, remain innovative in our structure and nomenclatures that fit our aspirations and inspire us to deliver exceptional value,\u201d a top official at the NNPC who pleaded to remain anonymous, told THISDAY.\n\nFurthermore, with the new status, greater emphasis must be placed on corporate governance. PIA 2021 made clear provisions regarding the Board of NNPC Limited. These provisions alongside CAMA mandate NNPC to be structured in a manner that conforms with best practices.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari inaugurated the Board of NNPC Limited and charged the Board members to ensure that the company remains focused on profitability, continuous value creation beyond legal and regulatory compliance, and operational excellence at par with industry peers while acting as an enabler to foster development.\n\nNNPC had explained that it was fully committed to effective corporate governance, accountability, appropriate risk management and sustainable value in the face of the energy transition.\n\nTo achieve this strategic requirement, four committees were set up by the Board of NNPC Limited comprising, the Board Establishment Committee (BEC), Board Finance, Strategy, and Investment Committee (BFSIC), Board Sustainability Committee (BSG) and Board Audit Committee (BAC).\n\nThe responsibilities of the committees are as follows: Board Audit Committee with oversight functions covering internal and external audit, enterprise risk management and internal controls, financial reporting, ethics, and compliance; Board Finance, Strategy and Investment Committee with oversight functions covering strategic planning, financing strategies and capital allocation, investment framework, performance reporting and Information Technology; Board Establishment Committee with oversight functions covering corporate governance, nomination and capacity development, succession planning and remuneration of directors, and Board Sustainability Committee with oversight functions covering long term sustainability, HSE, energy transition and Corporate Social Responsibility among others.\n\nThe Board committees are expected to be carrying out oversight functions of planning and implementation of the company\u2019s strategy and to define a framework for measuring and monitoring the performance of the company.\n\nIn terms of staff welfare, \u201ctoday NNPC is an equal opportunity employer of choice, going into the future, NNPC would be one of the most admired, attractive, and exciting global organisations to work with.\n\n\u201cOur Employee Value Propositions promise to be competitive and working with the company will offer employees the opportunity to actively contribute to creating long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. This singular sense of fulfilment of professionalism and patriotism for the greater good would be the best form of reward and recognition for our dedicated staff,\u201d the source added.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC Ltd, Mr Mele Kyari, recently explained: \u201cOn 1st of July, we crossed over to the NNPC Limited both technically and financially on every aspect. Not only that, on the 19th of July, I\u2019m inviting all of you to be present. Mr President will unveil the NNPC Limited to all of us on the 19th of July, and I\u2019m inviting you.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this to our industry is that you\u2019re going to have the partner of choice, the partner that will support you, the partner that will be the largest capitalised company in Africa. Not only that, a partner that will be born of best practice, of everything that you can think of because we\u2019re going to be a CAMA company. We are going to be another Shell, decision making would be easy, finances will also be easy.\u201d\n\nKyari stated that the NNPC would be very frontal in its moves to acquire as many oil and gas assets as possible with the mindset to become one of the biggest oil firms in the world.\n\n\u201cWhat is very fundamental is that the NNPC is set to be the partner of choice. We will be the biggest capitalised company in Africa. We will be the partner that will be focused on the commercial value of every engagement that we do.\n\n\u201cWe will be the biggest oil and gas company and therefore there will be no distinction between the NNPC and the rest of the partners that we have in this business.\n\nWith Growing Drilling Challenge, Nigeria\u2019s H1 Oil Production Falls by 28m Barrels\n\nMeanwhile, the data from NUPRC showed that Nigeria produced 302.4 million barrels in the first half of 2020, which was regarded as the COVID-19 year, 248.6 million barrels in the same period in 2021, and slumped further to 220.016 million barrels from January to June this year. That is an 11.29 per cent change between 2021 and 2022.\n\nWith the drop from the 302.4 million barrels in the first half of 2020 to 220.016 million barrels in the first half of 2022, Nigeria lost 82 million barrels of production between 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe NUPRC data further showed that in the first six months of 2021, when the world had started recovering from the pandemic, Nigeria also surpassed this year\u2019s six-month drilling total for the same period by 28.6 million barrels.\n\nThe figures highlight the seriousness of the drastic fall in the country\u2019s crude production capacity, which has been blamed on massive oil theft, deteriorating upstream infrastructure, prolonged lack of investment in the sector as well as the inability to restart oil wells shut down in the height of the pandemic.\n\nOf the country\u2019s recorded 35 terminals/streams, the NUPRC data showed that Ajapa, Ima and Anambra Basin remain non-producing, while Tulja-Okwuibome started producing in 2022, after a period of dormancy in 2020 and 2022.\n\nTo underscore the seriousness of the under-production challenge, out of the 1.772 million barrels per day of crude oil allocated to the country by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in June, Nigeria was only able to produce 1.158 million bpd, according to the latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) by the organisation.\n\nA THISDAY review during the week showed that Nigeria\u2019s daily underperformance pegged against the OPEC quota yielded a whopping 614,000 bpd or 19.034 million barrels deficit for the month alone.\n\nA further breakdown revealed that valued against $110 per barrel for the period, Nigeria may have lost as much as $2,093,740,000 to its inability to increase the country\u2019s production level.\n\nFor a country with a huge foreign exchange shortage, the loss could, if it had been plugged, for a start, help cash-strapped federating units (states and local governments) embark on major projects.\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "For the first time, President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday opened up on the intrigues preceding the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), revealing that he was given a list of 30 aspirants to choose a successor but he declined.\n\nBuhari, who stated that the presidential candidate of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu emerged through a free and fair democratic process, added that if he had anointed a candidate, his decision would have affected Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who was also an aspirant.\n\nThe National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had 24 hours before the primary election, announced the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, as the party\u2019s consensus presidential candidate, saying that President Buhari was behind the decision.\n\nBut following the backlash that greeted the announcement, President Buhari, according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, told the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum in his office in Abuja that he had \u201cno preferred candidate\u201d and had \u201canointed no one\u201d.\n\nProviding more clarification on Saturday when he paid Sallah homage to the Emir of Katsina, Dr Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, at his palace in Katsina, the state capital, President Buhari recalled the circumstances surrounding the emergence of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate.\n\nAccording to him, the APC delegates were given a free hand to elect Tinubu to demonstrate the internal democracy in the party.\n\nPresident Buhari admitted that APC stalwarts gave him a list of 30 presidential aspirants to choose a preferred successor but he declined and allowed the delegates to elect the candidate of their choice, hence the emergence of the former Lagos State governor.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are doing our best and I hope that our efforts will be a blessing. There is nothing more important than peace and because of that those who are instigating insecurity whatever their reasons, we pray God will give us more wisdom to tackle them.\n\n\u201cI was given a list of 30 aspirants to pick from; most of them were my ministers and governors. So, who will I choose or support? One of the governors even came to see me and asked who we should choose.\n\n\u201cBut if I do that, it would affect my vice president because he was listening to our conversation. I then told them to choose who they want. So, they elected Tinubu as APC presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI hope that the way they (APC) conducted their congress where they elected the party\u2019s National Chairman, the presidential candidate and how the presidential candidate picked his running mate \u2013 I hope the forthcoming (2023) general election will also be peaceful. I hope God will help us to conduct the general election peacefully.\n\n\u201cMay God help us to overcome the problem of this country. But if Nigerians know the condition that other African countries are in, they will thank God for the situation in Nigeria. We are doing our best and hope that God will give us more wisdom to continue to help and serve our people\u201d.\n\nBuhari admonished Nigerians to continue to be patient with the APC-led government and allow peace to reign during the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\nHe explained that if Nigerians know what other African countries were going through in terms of insecurity and economic challenges, they would appreciate the Nigerian situation and his government\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe president added that there is nothing more important than security and peaceful coexistence and that his government would adopt revolving security measures to nip in the bud those instigating insecurity in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement issued by presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, President Buhari, said \u201cwhen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) signalled parties to elect their presidential candidates, we had 30 aspirants, mostly ministers in my cabinet and governors.\n\n\u201cI told each of the aspirants to go and do their best. One particular governor, in his wisdom, came to meet me and asked who they should vote for at the party convention, checking if I had a preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere was no need for interference, knowing the competence of all the aspirants. They went and elected Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and he picked his running mate, Senator Kashim Ibrahim, for the 2023 elections. I am praying that we will have peaceful and successful elections,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President while thanking Nigerians for their support for the APC in 2015, and 2019, said he had a rich experience in the 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 presidential elections, travelling to all the 774 local councils in the country, and in 2019 visiting 36 states.\n\nHis words: \u201cThey say he who wants to serve should be ready for the responsibility of leadership. Three times I wanted this position and three times I ended up at the Supreme Court. For that reason, in terms of experience, I have gathered a lot. I visited 774 local councils in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI feel privileged that Nigerians elected me in 2015. Since then, we have been doing our best to tackle the challenges, with God helping us. We are not alone. If only we know what other countries in Africa are passing through, we will be grateful to God, and protect our country. Other African countries are passing through a lot.\n\nAccording to him, since Nigerians elected him in 2015, his administration had been doing everything to fix the country.\n\nHe, therefore, called on all citizens to do their best to protect the country, saying if Nigerians know how difficult it has been for other African countries, they will thank God for their country.\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we are doing our best and will keep doing our best to improve the situation. I am praying that the Almighty God will give us more strength and wisdom to protect our people, and fulfil our promises of ensuring wellbeing\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also urged all Nigerians to be tolerant of the government as it continues to tackle the challenges facing the country, noting that the situation is worse in other African countries.\n\nEarlier, the Emir called on the president to expedite actions for the completion of the Kano-Katsina road dualisation project; the Kano-Katsina-Maradi railway and the Rimi Windmill Power generation projects.\n\nThe traditional ruler said apart from contributing to the economic and social development of Katsina State, the projects if completed would also generate employment opportunities for unemployed youths in the state.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Aminu Bello Masari said security operatives were doing all they could to tackle banditry and other crimes in the state, calling on residents to also give them the needed support to ward off the criminals.\n\nGovernor Masari in the company of other top government officials later saw the president off to the Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua Airport where he later took off for Abuja in a Nigeria Air Force (NAF) plane.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",
