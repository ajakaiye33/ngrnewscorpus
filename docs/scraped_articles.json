          "title": "Buhari and Nigeria: Who belongs to whom?",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Tony Eluemunor\n\nHow many Nigerians really know their president; Gen. Mohammadu Buhari? Who knows his office hours? What does he do during the long flights of his frequent trips to other lands? What kind of books does he read? Does he, like former President Olusegun Obasanjo, be fully at work, poring through files even while ensconced in the presidential jet, moving from one far-flung corner of the globe to another?\n\nWhat is President Buhari\u2019s favourite food? Who are his trusted lieutenants? How diverse are their backgrounds? Does he have friends from all parts of the country, or is he an introversive man of few friends\u2026 only those he grew up with? Would this not also make him appear a provincial man, instead of a metropolitan? Yet, would such not be a self-disservice to a man whom soldering has taken to all parts of Nigeria, and professional courses have taken to diverse portions of the globe?\n\nWhy would Buhari\u2019s most remarkable unifying statement have caused a terrible din across the country? His inaugural speech contained a famous quip:\u201cI belong to all and I belong to nobody\u201d\n\nThat golden statement should have united the nation behind any president, but that magic did not work for Buhari. Many refused to believe that even the man, Buhari, believed in the words that he let drop from his own lips. That was a serious charge to make against a man who had just won a nation-wide election. Trust is the issue here!\n\nYet, that a large number of the populace believed that Buhari was beholden to a section of the country, is not the focus of this article. My focus is not even on the man himself and his sense of nationalism or the lack of it. My focus is on what Nigeria means to Buhari; specifically, does Buhari believe he is chief servant of Nigerians or he thinks he OWNS Nigeria? Is he the \u201cPrime Minister (servant),\u201d or the Prime Boss? When he speaks, does he address his bosses, or does he talk down on his servants? Does he sometimes think that he is doing us a favour by being our president? Or does he think that he, acting on God\u2019s behalf, has come to save us, and is taking Nigeria to a better level, not just another level?\n\nDoes Nigeria\u2019s contemporary history hold any lessons for Buhari? Has the national decline on every index of development meant anything to him? What about the massive daily loss of innocent lives due to herders\u2019 activities? Does the plummeting quality of life in Nigeria, about the lowest in the world now, ever bother him? And does he worry that just within the six years of his presidency, (we are in a democracy I assume) that he has not improved the quality of life of Nigerians in any way?\n\nWhat really did Buhari come into power to do? Did he promise to end insecurity in the country? Is Nigeria safer under Buhari than under his predecessor? What about the economy and food security? Despite Buhari\u2019s stringent, even draconian, measures while pursuing Nigeria\u2019s self-sufficiency in rice production, how successful is that scheme?\n\nIn the latest food security index, after Buhari\u2019s six years of governance, Morocco, a desert country, occupies the 57th position globally and leads in Africa. Algeria follows, then Tunisia and Egypt\u2014all desert countries. South Africa is in 69th. Buhari\u2019s Nigeria occupies the 100th position behind 74th position Botswan, 77th Ghana, 79th Mali, 82nd C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, 86th Kenya, 87th Niger, 88th Burkina Faso, 89th Tanzania, 90th Senegal, 92nd Benin, 93rd Togo, 94th Cameroon, 95th Uganda, 97th Angola, 98th, Congo (Dem. Rep.) 99th Mozambique.\n\nNow, a reason for Nigeria\u2019s food security crisis is Fulani herders\u2019 attack on farmers, especially in the Middle belt and the entire South. The second reason is Boko Haram\u2019s terrorism in the North-East. The third reason is the banditry in the North-West. Buhari has spoken against the second and the third, I really do not know if he has spoken against the FIRST, apart from the \u201cpastoralists versus farmers\u2019 crisis\u201d\u2014Aso-Rock\u2019s euphemism for terrorism.\n\nThen recently, the southern governors met at Asaba, and the Peoples Democratic Party and All Progressives Party members endorsed the enforcement of the ban on free grazing of cattle in their states. That was when Buhari chose to speak. And this President who had promised to belong to all and to none, showed his true colours. He opposed the ban but didn\u2019t say how he would end the evils of the herders which rankled the Governors. Kai!\n\nIt did not matter to Buhari that some states have passed the ban into law. It did not matter to him that he is not the Supreme Court. He did not say he would go to the Supreme Court to challenge such laws. He simply made a declaration. What would be the effect of his declaration on the killer herders? Did he think of it? Or did he actually make it just to embolden them? What did Buhari add to that speech to guide against sending the wrong signals to the herders?\n\nDoes Buhari know that Nigeria has a constitution? What really is involved in his pet dream; the Cattle colony, cattle reserves and cattle routes\u2014in a modern Nigeria? Is a president under the laws of the country or is the country under the whims of a president?\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria which Buhari and APC came to save was 12th in Africa food security index. Today, it has regressed to 23rd. So, why should Buhari and APC talk down on us instead of being apologetic? Why? Could Dr Henry Kissinger be right after all; that leaders rarely learn any lessons while in office and only consume the intellectual capital they brought with them into office? If, so, how rich is the intellectual capital Buhari brought to office\u2026such that he even won a re-election? Or, is the electorate actually to blame?\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "IPOB stay-at-home order: Tension in Ebonyi, Imo, Abia, others",
          "text": "By Sunny Nwankwo, Umuahia/Ogochukwu Anioke,Abakaliki/Damien Duruiheoma,Enugu/Chris Njoku,Owerri\n\nIt was all fears and tension in the Southeast states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo yesterday ahead of the commencement of the sit-at-home order issued by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nMany streets of Owerri, the Imo State capital, in particular, were deserted, disrupting economic and social activities.\n\nThe heavy presence of security personnel across the city was not enough to encourage the residents go about their normal businesses.\n\nResidents of other states in the zone rushed to the markets to stock their homes with essential food items.\n\nBut Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State told the people of the state to ignore the IPOB directive and go about their normal activities.\n\nSome residents berated IPOB and its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, for putting the people under unnecessary stress.\n\nKanu had asked the Igbo across the world to stay indoors from 6pm yesterday till tomorrow for the annual Biafra Remembrance Day.\n\nHe said the day was set aside in remembrance of over five million Biafrans who died during the Nigerian civil war.\n\nHe said the order is compulsory and must be obeyed by all the people in the region.\n\nHe warned that anyone seen outside would be killed.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom 6pm on 29th, there will be no movement. This is not sit-at-home but no movement. If you are found outside from 6pm, you are dead.\u201d\n\nOwerri markets and streets were deserted for much of yesterday.\n\nOwerri malls halted activities at about 12.30 pm am as against the normal 8.00 pm closing time.\n\nAlso, there was heavy security presence at the entrance to the Shoprite mall with the workers trapped in the building.\n\nA member of the mall\u2019s staff, who pleaded anonymity, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that normal activities began in the mall yesterday morning but were suddenly brought to a halt following sounds of gunshots in the neighborhood.\n\nHe added that this led to palpable fear; a situation which prompted the management of the mall to shut the building, leaving all staff and customers grounded.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe all came to work in the morning. For hours, we have been hearing gunshots. There is fear all around and no customer had come in since that time.\n\n\u201cThe management has directed that we close for today, though it\u2019s barely half day. They said we cannot leave the premises, nobody goes out and nobody comes in for now until the situation improves.\u201d\n\nThe heavy presence of security personnel, particularly on the Aba-Owerri Road, appeared to have kept people away from the popular Ekeukwu Owerri Market and the Timber Market in Naze.\n\nGunmen had operated around that area on Friday, which might have prompted the deployment of soldiers there yesterday.\n\nSecurity agencies have mounted checkpoints in major streets of the state capital and beyond to forestall any breakdown of law and order in the state.\n\nCommuters within and outside the state were stranded owing to the gridlock caused by the checkpoints.\n\nA motorist, Mr Rafael Ubochioma, said: \u201cI am confused because I just bought fuel from a nearby filling station with part of the fare I collected from passengers and right now, the road has been barricaded.\n\n\u201cMy fate and theirs remain uncertain as we speak,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs Stella Michael, a passenger, regretted embarking on the journey and urged security operatives not to make it appear that innocent road users are being punished for the activities of bandits.\n\nA commercial motorist, Nwajiuba Nonso, said people were afraid to come out.\n\nThe fear was heightened by a social media publication on Friday purportedly issued by IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu, warning people to stock their homes.\n\nHowever, the IPOB Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, told The Nation that Kanu did not issue any statement apart from the sit-at-home order.\n\nA commercial motorist, Mr Okechukwu Nnaji, said motorists started experiencing poor patronage from commuters from May 28.\n\n\u201cAs I speak with you, I have not made N2,000 since three days now. I normally make N8,000 daily. I don\u2019t know how to feed my family if things do not improve soon,\u201d he said.\n\nA food vendor, Mrs Angela Eze, popularly known as Mama Africa, expressed worries that the situation might affect the economy of the state drastically.\n\nShe appealed to government to use diplomacy and find lasting solution to the problem.\n\nIn Onitsha, Anambra State, some travellers en route Onitsha to Asaba and other parts of the country expressed dismay over the delays caused by security checks at the busy Niger Bridge, Onitsha in Anambra.\n\nTravellers were made to spend hours at the Bridgehead before crossing. Those who managed to cross over to Asaba and vice versa did so by trekking or using commercial motorcycles.\n\nA traveller who pleaded anonymity said he joined an early morning vehicle heading to Lagos but was delayed by the checkpoint mounted by the Police and the Nigeria Army.\n\n\u201cI have spent more than three hours here trying to drive across the bridgehead.\n\n\u201cThey said some gunmen killed five soldiers yesterday at Ihiala.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is why they are delaying us here,\u201d the source said.\n\nIn his reaction, the Police Public Relations Officer, Anambra Police Command, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, said the security check was a routine exercise.\n\nIkenga said the checkpoint was part of the strategies security agencies used to control and screen people coming in or leaving the state.\n\n\u201cThe check has been there before now even before the sit-at-home order. The purpose of the check point is to screen road users, detect crime and maintain law and order.\n\n\u201cInasmuch as we are still analysing the security situation, the checkpoint is like an ordinary day exercise for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe spokesman said the police was bent on delivering its mandate of protecting lives and property.\n\nPanic buying in Abia\n\nResidents of Aba, the commercial nerve centre of Abia State, yesterday rushed to the markets to make last minute purchases of perishable and non-perishable items ahead of the IPOB declared sit-at-home order.\n\nAriaria International Market, Power Line, Bakassi Shoe Plaza, Ahia Ohuru, Shopping Centre and Cemetery markets appeared to record huge sales.\n\nUnlike other Saturdays in Aba, the roads were busy with passengers and vehicles coming in and leaving Aba in droves.\n\nThe Abia State Police Command enjoined residents and visitors to the state to disregard the IPOB, MASSOB or any other pro-Biafra group sit-at-home order.\n\nIts spokesman, Geoffrey Ogbonna, urged Abians to go about their lawful duties and businesses without any fear of intimidation or molestation.\n\nOgbonna, who assured the residents of the safety of their lives and property during and after Monday, May 31 stated that the police in conjunction with other sister agencies were working round the clock to ensure that Abia is safe.\n\nHe enjoined parents to warn their children against involving in violence or any other anti-social activities, stressing that the police and other security agencies would ensure that Abia remains peaceful and conducive for business and economic activities to thrive.\n\nUmahi: \u2018Ignore IPOB, go about your duties\u2019\n\nGovernor David Umahi of Eboyi State yesterday told the people of the state to ignore the sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and go about their normal activities.\n\nHe banned all forms of procession or gathering in the state till further notice.\n\nHe branded the sit-at-home order as foolishness.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have been getting voices from certain agitators that tomorrow there will be no movement. This is foolishness.\n\n\u201cIf there is no movement in the Southeast, is there no movement in the whole country? What an Ebonyi man will never accept is to go into second slavery under any guise.\n\n\u201cWe know the Biafra we need is to have enough money so that we cleanse up the toga of the slavery that our brothers and sisters subjected us to when we were under what they want us to be under.\n\n\u201cWe need money. If you love Ebonyi State, bring money. Come up and put one construction. Let us see your houses and investments in Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that there will free movement throughout today, throughout tomorrow and ongoing.\n\n\u201cI challenge the youths, the local government chairmen and the politicians, the stakeholders, the security agencies to ensure that nobody is molested. And I have banned any form of procession or gathering in Ebonyi State till further notice.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, I will want people who are of Christian faith to go about their church services and pray for our nation, pray for the souls that have departed both during the war and now that people are being killed.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, markets must be fully operational. Anybody whose store is not opened will forfeit the store. I have asked the security agencies to massively deploy security people to protect Ebonyians everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe governor advised any group involved in any form of agitation in the region to do so peacefully.\n\n\u201cLet us stay in peace. Agitation does not mean violence. Agitation does not mean insulting the leaders of this country. Agitation does not mean killing security agencies.\n\n\u201cWhen Mandela fought for the liberation of South Africa, he was there. Let all the freedom fighters for the Southeast come down to the Southeast so that we can all be together. We should not stay outside the country and be vomiting rubbish and collecting hard currencies and be luring our people to be destroyed.\u201d\n\nReacting to Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s threat that anyone violating the sit-at-home order would be killed, a resident of Ebonyi State, Augustine Igboji, said that by threatening the lives of the people, IPOB was confirming the terrorist tag given to it by the federal government.\n\nHe said: \u201cNnamdi Kanu started as a freedom fighter. His agitation was termed peaceful agitation for actualization of Biafra. He is often lamenting that the federal government is denying Nd\u00edgbo their fundamental human rights. He claimed the ESN was formed to protect the people.\n\n\u201cBut today, he is threatening death on anybody who flouts the sit-at-home order, telling them that it is no longer voluntary but compulsory. Telling people not to move around is a denial of their fundamental human right.\n\n\u201cThreatening them with death or attacks if they flout the order is close to terrorism. And if anybody is attacked on that day, well, let\u2019s pray nothing like that happens.\n\n\u201cBut let me just say that Kanu and IPOB is fast descending into an anarchist organisation. Something close to a terrorist group which the FG branded them some years back.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the people will revolt against you too. Is this how he will lead Biafra if he gets it? By brute force? This is how despots start. I will rather remain in Nigeria than follow such a leader.\u201d\n\nFor Mr Emmanuel Nnaemeka, Kanu and IPOB are slowly turning into a monster which may consume the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are creating a monster that may consume us soon. I listened to Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s threat online and I was shocked. I started wondering how the leadership of Biafra will look like.\n\n\u201cHe threatened that his boys will kill anyone that dares step out of the house that day. Is that how they will rule Biafra? To use gunmen to threaten people into doing everything they say?\n\nA legal practitioner, Mr Steve Nworie, described the ban on movement by Mr Kanu as unacceptable.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is palpable fear across the Southeast because of the numerous messages of death by the leader of IPOB against anyone who dares to come out on Monday 31st May, 2021.\n\n\u201cWhile I will personally obey this stay-at-home order because I am convinced that it is the right thing to do, I am particularly concerned by the blanket coercion deployed by Nnamdi Kanu and his team.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there are so many Igbo sons and daughters who out of no choice of theirs may be forced to be on the road on Monday. How do we justify their deaths when the supreme leader has said that not even a rat will be spared alive if it is seen on the road across the Southeast?\n\n\u201cHow about essential workers whose lines of duty are so essential for the well-being of Ndigbo? Do they deserve to die in their line of duties? How about those who are forced out on the road due to unexpected emergencies that are totally beyond them? Do they deserve the death penalty by the Biafran militias?\u201d\n\nHe warned Mr Kanu to desist from such threats, saying it will not bode well for him in the long run.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPro-Biafra group to IPOB: Yours no more freedom struggle\n\nA pro-Biafra group, Biafra Regional Emancipation Movement, accused IPOB and its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, of inflicting serious pains on the people of the Southeast it claims to protect.\n\nIn a statement issued by the coordinator of the group, Comrade Chile Nwoko, it described the tactics of IPOB as an early stage of terror.\n\n\u201cWe state that no one nor group/groups should worsen the economic situation of Biafrans,\u201d Biafra Regional Emancipation Movement said.\n\nIt added: \u201cThe aim for the liberation struggle is to free Biafrans from the sufferings in Nigeria and, therefore, we do not see the benefit of putting the people under undue fear and stress.\u201d\n\nMASSOB urges churches to hold special prayers for Biafra fallen heroes\n\nThe leadership of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) asked churches in the Old Eastern Region and other parts of the country to hold special prayers for its fallen heroes on May 30.\n\nComrade Uchenna Madu\u2019s led faction of MASSOB reminded leaders of various churches in the Old Eastern Region the need to see the agitation for a Sovereign State of Biafra as their project as most Biafrans are predominantly Christians.\n\nMadu, who stated that there would be human and vehicular movements including holding of socials today, however urged residents of the Old Eastern Region to ensure that they heed the sit-at-home on May 31.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis year, Biafra Day anniversary celebration will be unique and special because it falls on a Sunday. Observing the Biafra day anniversary celebration on a Sunday makes it more Christianized because the people of Biafra are predominantly Christians.\n\n\u201cBiafra was declared on May 30th, 1967 by General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the leader of Biafra nation. May 30th is sacrosanct and sacred to the history and lives of Biafra Republic. The ordinances of our greatest leader, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, must be jealousy and eloquently adhered to.\n\n\u201cMASSOB directs all the churches in Biafra land to observe special prayers and supplication for the fallen Biafra heroes during the Nigeria-Biafra war and our comrades that were killed by Nigeria security agents, including the people of Biafra that died in the hands of Islamic Boko Haram and terrorist herdsmen.\n\n\u201cOur religious and church leaders should stop praying for the betterment of Islamic Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere will be movements and normal social activities on May 30th, being Sunday, because of Christian worship. But there will be a sit-at-home exercise on May 31st, being Monday, for the people of Biafra as a mark of solidarity and honour for Biafra land.\n\n\u201cMASSOB directs all markets, schools, banks and all other public offices in Biafra land to observe the sit-at-home exercise as a mark of respect for our fatherland.\u201d",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nThe Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, recently fielded questions from journalists in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nAnd the governor reacted to a recent interview by former governor of Niger State, Dr Babangida Aliyu, saying that some of the allegations made by the ex-Niger governor were directed at him. Excerpt from the encounter.\n\nIn his recent interview, a former governor of Niger State, Dr. Babangida Aliyu, said that you are the cause of the crisis in PDP because you want to be a godfather, or a dictator. Are you a dictator?\n\nThere is no political dictator in Rivers State as far as PDP is concerned. That is why if there is any part of the country that PDP is sure of winning, should there be election today or tomorrow, that state is Rivers. That is not the case of Niger State. Babangida Aliyu is a political liability to PDP. He is not an asset. This is a man who came out to the public to say that he worked against the PDP in 2015. He went ahead to say \u2018we Northern governors worked against President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015\u2019. But people like Jonah Jang of Plateau State and Sule Lamido of Jigawa State came to say it is a lie, we never worked with you against our party. Babangida is what they call a chronic liar, a serial betrayal. So, I am not aware of any problem in my state. If there is, it would be reported and the state leadership will take it up. The same Aliyu Babangida in 2017 was one of those who opposed Uche Secondus to be chairman of the party. Aliyu has no job. Can you see what we are doing here working very hard to see that we do not allow APC in Rivers State. Ask Aliyu Babangida whether he can do the same in Niger State? Today, if they hold election in Niger State, can he make PDP to win in the state? As I talk with you now, no state congress of PDP has been done in Niger State. Niger State is one of the states that have not held congress of the party. Why? It is because of the dictatorial tendencies of Aliyu. The people that the masses want he does not want them. This is the character that you compare with me. All he does is to seek for committee meetings to attend. He has no job. He said he is a PhD holder. What he should have done is to offer himself to a university and say take me I want to contribute to the development of education. But, he will not do that. He has come to become the Spokesman of NWC. A man who betrayed his party. Now he is saying the party should suspend me, I will be happy. It is not to bulge out eyes, what does he have in stock to offer the party? If Aliyu Babangida leaves PDP today, nobody will even bother. But, if I decide to leave the party today, you know its consequences. Upon the PhD he claims he has, he cannot understand English. I did not say all NWC, I said some members of the NWC are acting as tax collectors. Ordinarily, I don\u2019t even have time to talk about Aliyu. When Aliyu was the governor of Niger State, many of you have been to Niger, let him show you one concrete thing he did. All he knows when I invite people to come and commission projects in my state he gets angry that I don\u2019t invite him. Why should I invite him when he does not merit it? In 2015, he was governor, PDP lost woefully. In 2019, PDP lost woefully in the same state, no House of Assembly, no senator, no council chairman, no House of Representatives. What is the impact of such a person to the party? In 2019, even with the federal might against us, we were able to deliver all the assembly seats, all the Senate candidates. So, who is more useful to the party? Is it the person who cannot win his immediate constituency? It is unfortunate. People are working to ensure that PDP takes power in 2023, he is here talking. People like Aliyu Babangida are the moles we have in PDP. He is a mole in PDP. These are people who get information and ignore the vital part of the information. If I say something today against PDP, of course, you know the consequences of that. What I am saying is that he is a political liability to PDP. If I leave PDP, I will win election in any party I join today.\n\nIs there a problem between you and the National Chairman of your party, Uche Secondus?\n\nWe must always disagree. Is that what people see as crisis? When we got to the local government, we said look we can\u2019t continue to be this way; there is need to go the other way in order to carry everybody along. You may agree, you may also disagree. If I have a problem with you, you and I know that I will not hide my feelings, I will tell you. If there is anything tomorrow that Secondus is not doing well I will tell him. Is he God? Everybody who knows me knows that I don\u2019t need to use another person to fight anybody. Just like I am telling you that Aliyu Babangida is a liability and a mole in the PDP. Then I will go and use some other person to say so? There is no one born of a woman that I cannot say that before him. So, you don\u2019t need to insinuate, you know me very well. I am not in the category of Aliyu Babangida; he knows that very well. If he is telling me that I have problem with Secondus, well Secondus has not come to the state to tell us that we have problem. If we have problem, we say, yes.\n\nDo you think that the National Working Committee of PDP is actually playing the roles expected of a party in opposition?\n\nMany people have said that it is very clear that it is easy for the PDP to take over in 2023. We have heard it. We said look, our party is not playing the real opposition role they are supposed to play. I don\u2019t need to wait for this Federal Government to do something before we start criticizing, I don\u2019t need to wait. I am not speaking for the party. I speak as somebody who is in opposition. It is left for the party to say whether our national working committee is doing well. You are the public. Assuming I come out to say they are not doing well, you will say because I have interest somewhere. It is left for you, the observers, to say whether we are doing well or not as opposition party. It\u2019s you! If I say we are not doing well, it is easy to say he is not in tune with them. It is you what will judge. You will judge where PDP is doing well as opposition. I cannot set examination for myself as well mark it.\n\nAre you in support of the vote of confidence passed in the NWC by the party\u2019s Board of Trustee (BoT)?\n\nNow, that is what you see when people don\u2019t even know anything. What does the constitution of PDP provide for? That was an emergency meeting. Where is vote of confidence coming from? A vote of confidence you have to send motion to people and then it will appear on agenda of the meeting. You don\u2019t call for an emergency meeting, probably to pass a budget, for example, and you begin to pass vote of confidence. It is the handiwork of the same Aliyu Babangida, who will always come to meeting first to sit in the front. If the meeting is at 4:00p.m, he will come at 2:00p.m, so that he will sit in front to bulge out his eyes. If I was in that meeting and there was such an application, I would have said don\u2019t do this, what is the vote of confidence for? That people made allegation, so what. Who are those that made this allegation? Call them, why are you making such allegations? Don\u2019t you know you are embarrassing our party? You don\u2019t rush things. When something happens, there is panic in you, let us do this, and that is why we will continue to make mistakes.\n\nDo you think Aliyu has the capacity to boast that the PDP would reclaim Ebonyi and Cross River states?\n\nNow, he is talking about PDP will recover Ebonyi and Cross Rivers states. What will be his contribution? What is the strategy for them to recover it? A man, who even in his place cannot provide votes is telling you that PDP will recover; recover your own first. Show the capacity first. You will first of all recover your own first. I can say so, because people have seen it. I don\u2019t think if in his own state federal might had come the way it came here that he would even get two votes; he would have run away. But, I stood there. Nigerians saw everything that happened. I can say, Cross Rivers State and Ebonyi are PDP states, PDP will take them back. Why will I say so because I know what is on ground. He does not know what is on ground. It is not to talk for people to hear you talking. Go and conduct congress in your state. In 2019, what happened to him? He insisted that his boy would be the governor and PDP lost. Who is then a dictator? Up till now, the state congress cannot take place because they want to dictate who becomes chairman of the party. You can now imagine a pot calling kettle black. Look at me I am the governor of Rivers State. If tomorrow I say I want to leave the party, for instance, I am not like any other people you think of, no. I am not a sycophant. I will tell you how I feel about it. The day I say I want to fight anybody in PDP, I will come out and fight the person. I am not going to hide. I will come out. I don\u2019t hide under any umbrella. For what?\n\nDon\u2019t you think there is a need for an appraisal of your party\u2019s NWC instead of calling for its removal?\n\nAliyu should be man enough to say that this person is calling for the removal of the NWC. Who did that person call? Was he one of those persons that was called? If I say, for example, that an officer is not doing well, or you are corrupt. Is that his interpretation of saying they should get rid of NWC? For grace sake, if anybody says NWC should be removed, the person should give reason, why it should be so. And there is nothing wrong if somebody holds such opinion and we can begin to justify that opinion. That is what they call democracy. He is not man enough. It is not to wear \u2018agbada\u2019 that makes you a man. What makes a man is coming out to speak your mind before anybody in the morning, afternoon and in the night. What you say in the morning, should be what you say in the afternoon and night. Not when you say this in the morning, tomorrow you wear another \u2018agbada\u2019 and change your position. In the night you wear jeans, you change. That is the kind of character Aliyu Babangida is. In everything you do you examine and re-examine. Even as a government, you do appraisal. Where have we not done well, where have we done well. That helps you to move on. As I am speaking today, we have given timetable of the activities we are to do. We will give account of stewardship at the end of the day. Having given that stewardship, we will have to reappraise ourselves. In education, are there things we did not do that we ought to do. In health, have we done well compared to where we were. In infrastructure, where are we today, where were we yesterday. If anybody calls for reappraisal of the NWC today, it does not mean that the person does not want the party to move forward. In fact, the person, who says let\u2019s have appraisal of what they have done, should be given credit. Aliyu Babangida is doing that because he thinks that the NWC will give him the chairmanship of the party at the state level, which he cannot win. So, he has to do anything to manoeuvre. To be sychophantic is not to be a servant. You said he is a servant? If he has been using that to deceive people, go to Niger State and see the level of development under Aliyu Babangida. Remember that in 2015, the same Aliyu Babangida was one of those going round to bring down PDP and, of course, he was happy he did that. Today, look at the consequences. That is the kind of man that has the temerity, the audacity to talk to a governor, whose state produced the highest vote for the party in 2015; 1.5 million votes. The ruling party never had 25 per cent in Rivers State. In 2019, the same state provided the highest vote for PDP, and the APC did not get 25 per cent. Ask Aliyu Babangida, the man that failed, whether we got 25 per cent in Niger State. Look at us making PDP proud everyday. That the PDP is surviving in this country is because of us, the governors. So, what makes your party to win is by providing the dividends of democracy. You see, he is now in Abuja. He cannot even go home. I challenge him, let him go and do congress in his state. He only attends every NEC meeting. When the meeting is by 3:00p.m he comes by 1:00p.m. He doesn\u2019t like staying at the back, he stays in front. They call him Aliyu Babangida, PhD, then he is talking like a small boy.\n\nDo you have a presidential ambition or do you want to be a vice president?\n\nWhen somebody has an ambition, you must see him going from one place to another. Have you ever seen me? I have challenged all of them, if I want to run for presidency nobody can stop me. Nobody. They are so timid. They are so intimidated. Sometimes you hear that he is running for vice president, does anybody run for vice president? Sometimes, they query themselves, this his performance why is he doing it? This is his second tenure. If it is not for presidency why must he be performing like this? Is performance only for the first tenure? What kind of a country are we? Was I elected only for first tenure? I have not told anybody I want to be president. Like I hear Aliyu that does not have strength that I want to be a godfather. Godfather to whom? Aliyu was bold to say that he worked against President Goodluck Jonathan and you still allow such a character to be in your highest decision-making body. It is unfortunate.\n\nWith all these attacks from some leaders of your party, are you still committed to rebuilding the PDP?\n\nIf I am a member of the party, to show that I am one, commitment must be there. Just like when Benue and Bauchi states had some crises, as a man, who loves the party, I said, look we can\u2019t be here and allow the crises because that will affect the chances of the party. I came out and said to them, gentlemen, we will resolve the problem. But, Aliyu from the North Central, never called the governor of Benue to see how that matter would be resolved with the governor of Bauchi. That is why I said when these things happen, it makes them happy because they are moles in the party. If they truly believe in PDP, why will they not continue to work for the party? So, why am I in the party? If I am not in the party, then, I will not work. But, if I am in the party, I will work.\n\nHow do you react to Aliyu\u2019s statement that you are trying to control the party by throwing money around because your state has the money?\n\nThat is to tell you his level of stupidity, with all due respect. I did know him as an auditor. He is so empty. You try to support the party he said you have money to buy the party. I am not the first governor of Rivers State under PDP. But he should also know that when PDP was nearly killed, he was running around Sheriff and the rest of them. That has been his lifestyle. What is the money? Have I gone to him one day to offer him money to do this for me. Okay, we have agreed, since he doesn\u2019t have money, let him run the party and let us see where the party will go to. I cannot be in a political party and I cannot support the party. If I am in PDP, I will continue to support PDP. But people like Aliyu for Christ\u2019s sake, what does he have to offer the party? Is it to come and show how big your eyes are. Will that make PDP to win election? What is his strategy for PDP in Niger State and Nigeria to win election? Let him come and I will challenge him to a debate on how PDP can win election. If I call him tomorrow now to come and commission project in the state, will he not come? I will send him global express now he will run down. But, I will not invite him because he did not do anything in Niger State. He does not qualify as somebody I should invite to commission projects because he never had any project. With due respect I invite those who offer something to their states. How did he come to be governor? A civil servant. Who didn\u2019t know how he became governor of Niger State. Some people should stop thinking that because they have some privileges that they are special people. What special people are they? Who is Aliyu Babangida, who is he? In the politics of this country, who is he?\n\nAliyu also suggested that you want Secondus out of the way to enable you produce your successor?\n\nOh, my God! Can Secondus produce my successor? What kind of talk is that? Is Secondus trying to produce my own successor? Am I going to produce his own successor? So, that is what they have been planning. So, Secondus told him that I want him out, so that I will produce my successor. So, if Secondus is there, I cannot produce my successor, how will he do it? I think he should not put PDP into trouble. They want to sit down in Abuja and produce my successor. Where will they come and campaign? They will campaign in Abuja. Which venue in Rivers State will they campaign? The Wike you know, just tell me the truth, how will they survive it? How many of them have been to a political war before? Is it to stay in Abuja and talk? What I will give you, you will run. They will be in the hospital because their BP (Blood Pressure) will be very high. How can you talk about successor? I have said I will not impose anybody on Rivers people. I have said that. If I say I will not do that which national chairman will do that, who is the person? How can anybody dream of that? I don\u2019t think Secondus told him that; I don\u2019t think so. Is it me that is an asset to PDP. Compare me and Aliyu, who will PDP take? They should try it and see whether they will not lose 60 per cent. So, don\u2019t talk about Aliyu saying this. He is a noise-maker. He is a perpetual blackmailer, that is how he survives. No work for him now. He should better take his PhD to go and lecture students and be happy.\n\nWhat do you make of the Saraki\u2019s reconciliation committee?\n\nAliyu Babangida is an empty head. Bukola Saraki and Shema, former governor of Bauchi State, came to see me on Friday and they left on Saturday and a liability is talking that the NWC should have suspended me. Such characters are they the ones that can help PDP? Okay, I have now surrendered myself; so, tell NWC now, ask police to come. If they do it, I will be very happy that some of the burdens are now out. I have confidence not like that liability in Niger State causing unnecessary distractions.\n\nWhat is your take on the issue of zoning?\n\nI can\u2019t air my views now. If I do, what will I say when I go to the meeting? I will not air my view now. I don\u2019t owe anybody. I will speak my mind anyday, anytime. I am not slave to anybody. So, I speak my mind that is who I am. There is nothing this government has not done to me. So, who am I going to be afraid of?",

          "title": "Nigeria heavily challenged \u2013 Olisa Agbakoba (SAN)",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nHuman rights activist, legal giant, and former President of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Mr Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) is worried on how Nigeria is drifting by the day.\n\nHe,therefore, warned that unless very urgent actions are taken, Nigerians may not have a country to call their own again.\n\nIn his bold and courageous manner, he blamed this on leadership failure while pointing out the way forward.\n\nHe spoke with Sunday Sun in an exclusive interview. Excerpt:\n\nMost analysts have come up with a damning conclusion that Nigeria is now a failed state. What is the true position given your legal background?\n\nWell, I can only refer to the index that is published on an annual basis by the Freedom House and it is entitled: \u201cThe Index of fragile states\u201d and out of about 200 countries, Nigeria is about 14, so that is the status of the nature of Nigeria\u2019s ranking by hopefully, independent neutrals who use certain criteria to determine how fragile a state is or can be. That is where Nigeria ranks. Across, we see in Nigeria a lot of tension around the question of insecurity across the country. In the Northeast you have Boko Haram, in the Northwest is the question of kidnappings and banditry, in the Southwest, not much of insecurity, but a stir in large scale of unemployment, something like about 70 million Nigerians are technically unemployed or unemployable, so that is a vulnerable and willing mass of people that can be deployed for misbehaviour, in the Southeast, there is a question of IPOB and the sovereignty issues around Biafra, in the North-central there is the herdsmen and the farmers\u2019 issue, in the South-south, the issue of environmental degradation has been replaced by the world\u2019s most dangerous seas. Nigeria is now number 1 as the most dangerous area of piracy, as rated by the International Maritime Bureau. So this is already a cocktail of insecurity and it is something that I think that the government needs to tackle very seriously and whether they are doing that effectively has been the subject of public debate. I think the governors of the South who had a meeting recently have shown how serious the issues are if they are calling for state police so that they can better control their security apparatus. On the whole, one will say that Nigeria is very heavily challenged.\n\nNigeria seems to be at a tipping point. Where do you locate the mistakes that brought us to this sour situation?\n\nLeadership, yes, leadership is the main problem and Chinua Achebe has said that in his book \u201cThe trouble with Nigeria\u201d. Leadership is the reason we have been in trouble. This is because leadership means recognizing and diagnosing issues and resolving them promptly. If you allow matters to fester, for instance, the nature of Nigeria\u2019s federal structure has festered for not less than 20 years and each government creates a National Conference without resolving the problem. And so it is carried from Obasanjo to Yar\u2019Adua to Jonathan and it\u2019s still unresolved, so it means we have been living in a process that has not been stabilized and when that process is not stabilized the likelihood of releasing our fullest potential will be affected.\n\nDo you think that with restructuring but still with bad leadership controlling the clutches of power that we can still get it right?\n\nNo, no, no, not at all, we wouldn\u2019t. I have always said to the annoyance of those who feel that I should be a core restructurist that restructuring alone is not enough. There is a lot more than restructuring and they ask me: \u201cWhat more?\u201d There is the leadership, there is the maturity and sagacity of the political parties, there is the honest intents of even Nigerians, the followers, etc, there are a lot that you put on the table to release the sort of energy that will make Nigeria turn around, but if the thinking is that merely to restructure, it will resolve the problems, that is a big, huge joke, it wouldn\u2019t. if you look at the governors who are calling for restructuring, generally in the states the level of bad governance is very high because they stifle the local governments, and when they stifle the local governments, the base of Nigeria where people live they create problems there too. I don\u2019t live in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I live in Lagos State, the Federal Republic of Nigeria is just an expression. I can\u2019t say I live in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, but I can say, I live in Lagos State and I live in Eti-Osa Local Government, so it is Eti-Osa Local Government that influences the quality of my life. So, if local governments are stifled around Nigeria and they cannot deliver services, then there is a big problem. So, restructuring has nothing to do with providing autonomy for local governments to deliver basic services on refuse collection, education, inspection of hospitals to make sure people are not dying there, water supply, roads, etc, these are the little things expected from the local governments. So, if already governors are not able to allow freedom of say, the judiciary and the parliaments in their states, why will restructure suddenly be a magic wand to change things? So, that is not correct. Leadership, I think is crucial in how Nigeria can go forward.\n\nIf you look at your political zone, the Southeast area seems to be boiling. Can you hazard out what exactly is building up?\n\nThe perception of exclusion and marginalisation is fuelling the impetus for political instability. In any process where the family excludes one brother, he is not invited to the table to take part in the meal then he will go away feeling unwanted and the tendency to misbehave is high, so there is a strong feeling that the Southeast has not been at the centre and has not taken part in the collaborative process of what\u2019s going on in Nigeria, in particular, the question of Igbo presidency or not. Such neglect or exclusion fuels people who feel that the time has come to be out of Nigeria, that they want to be Biafrans. But the tension between those who want to remain in Nigeria like me and those who want to leave creates the necessary frictions that you see and recall I told you that the high level of unemployment means that it is very easy to mobilise a troop of people willing to cause grievous harm, so that\u2019s the reason the Southeast is boiling \u2013 the perception of the people that they are excluded in the scheme of things.\n\nYou just mentioned the issue of presidency of Igbo extraction. Do you think it\u2019s feasible in 2023?\n\nI am not a prophet so I cannot tell whether it will be feasible, but I think the more important question beyond whether a president of Igbo extraction is a possibility is the need for political stability because if you don\u2019t have a country then talking about a president from any part of the zones is meaningless. So, I think the more important question now will be: \u201cHow we can pull back and ensure that there is political stability across the six zones that are now engaged in serious insecurity and conflict so that we can have a peaceful transition from President Buhari to whatever president that will take over in 2023\u201d, but if it is not possible then where a president comes from becomes irrelevant. So, I think the more important question between now (2021) and the next one year (2022) will be the real need to resolve all the communal tensions that we are looking at. There is a need to engage very seriously, all the conflict flashpoints, some of them, of course, involve the issue of restructure, we need to identify the problems and resolve them because where problems are unresolved you can\u2019t carry out political or economic activity. So, I will hope that the call by the governors of the South should be a rallying point for beginning to resolve the clear insecurity situation that we are faced, it\u2019s very vital, we have less than 12 months to do that, that is the timeline.\n\nDo you see this government having the capacity to undertake what you are recommending?\n\nI am not sure it is about President Buhari or this government, it is about the collective responsibility of leadership around PDP, APC, in particular, because these are the parties that are struggling for power and in the struggle for power they must put Nigeria first. If both parties agree to resolve all these issues we see around us, 80 per cent of the problem is resolved because President Buhari is part of a political party, so I don\u2019t separate the party from the government process. All the 36 governors have a role, that is why I identify the role that governors can play in resolving the crisis, it\u2019s very important. It is not just one government, it is the 36 governments and the federal government, and the political parties put together. In addition to this will also be the role of traditional institutions, religious institutions, etc, they have a role; they can\u2019t stand back because when things go bad it consumes everybody. The traditional and religious institutions must be involved, between the traditional institutions and religious institutions, largely have more membership than the parties combined and they have a lot of influence, so they must have a voice, everybody must be part of this national peace process where we will address the conflict flashpoints in an honest and genuine way. So whatever the grievance that we have, we put it on the table and see how it can be resolved and they are so many of them as I said earlier, restructuring, of course, is one of them, good leadership is another one, governance, economic development, the question of poverty, unemployment, etc, they are many issues. There is a whole cocktail of issues that are bogging Nigeria down and then what you see blow out is the Boko Haram, IPOB, Sea piracy, kidnappings, banditry etc, these are the side effects of the huge problem. So, all this insecurity is the effect of a failure of leadership. If the leaders, both state leaders and non-state leaders agree to work together, that is where the intention must be channeled, if they agree that there is a problem here then the problem can be resolved. But if everyone stays in his own ethnic or religious corner there will be no resolution.\n\nYou are also talking about coming together like a conference to deliberate on the issues, but Nigeria has had a lot of conferences, including that of 2014 National Confab during President Jonathan adjudged to be comprehensive and on consensus in submissions. How optimistic that another conference will be taken seriously?\n\nAgain, I am not a prophet, I don\u2019t know, but it is like a medical doctor looking at a patient and saying, here is what you need to do because these are the things I find wrong in you, whether you now follow my prescription is up to you, so the problem with Nigeria is that there has been a lot of talking, we know what the problems are, but the energy to resolve them has been the problem and, therefore, I don\u2019t say, it\u2019s the president, the onus is on everybody because religious and traditional institutions are part of Nigeria, they are also part of the elite, so they cannot abdicate their role, we need to hear them speak up more strongly, they are not doing that. Even the business community we need to hear all of them speak up louder because it is when they speak up that the governors who are the head of political leadership listen and say oh there is a problem, but if they are silent and nobody is talking then there isn\u2019t that realization that things are very bad. I want to hear our traditional rulers, our religious leaders speak to the problems more forcefully and more urgently, it\u2019s very important. They must speak truth to power.\n\nYou and some members of your group like Femi Falana (SAN) are coming up with a new movement. What new things are you people bringing on board as to give hope to Nigerians?\n\nIt\u2019s almost these things that I have just been describing; how we can mobilise the political elite into a consensus of saying, here is what the problems are and these are the solutions that we feel that we can offer. So, part of what we are doing is to assist to identify some of the constitutional constraints in the 1999 Constitution and then to suggest how if those constraints are removed it might make the process more settled. For instance, the question of state police, if we have only one central police force there is no way the IG of Police can superintend Nigeria, it has shown to be impossible, which was why you now have regional security networks. So, it will make more sense if governors of states have the power to administer the security situation in their states. I think it will promote peace and good order. So, those are some of the things that we are calling for. We also talk about the need to resolve the large unemployment problem because if you have unemployed people you have angry people and you have people who can easily get into misbehaviour. It is a problem that Nigerian state needs to tackle. These are the sort of things that we put on the table for consideration by those who can take the actual decisions because we feel it is best to say these things than keep quiet. That potentially is the role we are playing.\n\nHow will you rate President Buhari leadership so far having been there for six years?\n\nThe challenge is that the Nigerian federation is crippled with inconsistency and it is those inconsistencies that trap the ability of the government to deliver. So, I am not so keen to say, how do I rate the government as in asking the question of what can be done to improve governance. The problems of ethnicity, the problems of religion are so dividing us that the outcomes we see are not unexpected because we have refused to place the issue of governance and the constraints before us and tackle them. It is like if you have bad roads and you drive the bad road in your car and the car is damaged. You do not blame the car, but you should talk about the bad roads, so the Nigerian situation is so terribly crippled that the possibility of any good outcome is so difficult. Electricity is not there, water is not there, there are no jobs, there are no roads, etc. The question is why are these things playing out? It is playing out because we cannot look towards a national identity, everybody is in an ethnic enclave and that has impeded the ability of any leader to responsibly deliver the dividends of democracy. So, if we keep asking the wrong question, what is the scoring of government? I will rather ask the other question; let us fix our problems. Do you know how many years this has been going on? Bola Ige asked a question and I sent it on the platform. There is nothing wrong in calling your wife in a meeting to say: \u201cThis union of ours is not working, so let us separate.\u201d Those are the hard questions we need to ask. Bola Ige said there are two questions. First, do we want to be in one Nigeria? If yes, how? If no, how do we amicably split? That is the central question, if we don\u2019t answer it we can never have good governance. That is what has pinned us down. What we have in Nigeria today is certainly not working because there is no common national objective. If we are 11 football players on the pitch with different strategies to play the game, they will lose, so we need to forge a common identity, so rather than pretend, we need to ask ourselves do we really want to be in one country? That is the central question if we answer yes, then the second question will be: In what form? So, that different parts of the country will put their grievances on the table and issues are amicably resolved.",

Five out of the abducted students and a Male warden were grossly murdered by the bandits.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that, today, being Saturday, May 29, 2021 that all the remaining students and non academic staff have been released by the bandits and they have already been reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, University Council, Management, Staff and Students of our university, we wish to thank all Nigerians and well wishers all over the world for standing by us during this trying times\u201d.\n\nBandits had on April 18 invaded the university located along the dreaded Kaduna-Abuja road about 8:30pm and abducted 23 students. Few days after the abduction, the bandits, who had demanded N800 million as ransom, killed five of the students, when negotiations were still going on.\n\nOn April 23, the bandits killed three of the students, five days after their abduction. Their remains were found in Kwanan Bature village, close to the university. On April 26, two more students were killed and security personnel recovered their corpses in the bush.\n\nOne of the parents was said to have paid a ransom of N20 million for the release of her son.\n\nOn its part, the Kaduna State Government said in a statement by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, \u201cThe kidnapped students of the Greenfield University, who had been held hostage by armed bandits, have been released by their abductors.\n\n\u201cThis was reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies. According to the reports, about 2pm today, Saturday, the hostages were found released along the Kaduna-Abuja road. Fourteen persons were released in total, comprising students and staff.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that they were abducted by armed bandits in April and had been in captivity since then. Five students were gruesomely killed by the bandits in the period.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufai welcomed the news of the students\u2019 release, and conveyed solace and encouragement to them following their harrowing ordeal.\n\n\u201cHe assured them that the bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives, as he wished them well for the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a short video that went viral last night, two of the parents of the abducted children, a man and a woman, who were bitter about their experience so far despite the release of their children confirmed that they paid some N180 million before the release that was later celebrated by government and security agencies.\n\nThe parents, who alleged neglect by the government both confirmed that neither the state nor the federal government participated in the process that led to the release of the children, particularly, that the security agencies refused to help in whatever form of shape.\n\n\u201cN180 million, that\u2019s what we paid; that\u2019s what they collected. One hundred and eighty million, that is they collected from us \u2013 from the parents without the help of a government. None of the government officials that has come to our aid since the 20th of April that they took these children. No single one policeman that the government has released to go after them,\u201d the male parent told a reporter, shortly after the children were released.\n\nSimilarly, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mohammad Jalige, also confirmed the release of the 14 students, when contacted by telephone. Jalige, who said the students were released Saturday evening, added that three of them were still being held.\n\n\u201cYes, 14 of the students of the Greenfield University were released from captivity this evening (Saturday), remaining three of them still in captivity,\u201d Jalige explained. He did not give details of the students\u2019 release and why three were still being held.\n\nWhen contacted, Registrar of the university, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, said he was busy and promised to confirm later. \u201cYes, we are still on it. I am very busy right now. You can call me back later to confirm,\u201d Bashir said by telephone.\n\nOne Sani Idris Jalingo, who claimed to be the leader of the bandits that abducted the students, had in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa Service, on May 3, threatened to kill the students if a ransom of N100 million in addition to 10 new Honda motorcycles were not provided the following day.Jalingo had disclosed during the interview that the families of the abducted students paid N55 million.\n\nHowever, in a statement on May 14, the spokesman of parents of the students, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, said the parents contributed N60 million as ransom for the release of the students but failed to secure their release.\n\nAfter series of negotiations, the bandits were said to have demanded the sum of N10 million from each of the parents of the students for their release.\n\nIt could not be immediately established how much each parent paid for the release of the students and why three of them are still in captivity.\n\nThirty-nine students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna, had also be kidnapped on March 11 in a similar manner, when bandits invaded their school about 11: 30pm. The last batch of 27 of the students was released about two weeks ago after spending 56 days in captivity. Their parents were said to have paid millions of naira before they were released.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Troops kill 17 insurgents, IPOB members in Borno, Rivers\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, said yesterday that the armed forces would not relent in their onslaught against terrorists until the enemies of the Nigerian state were defeated. Irabor said despite the risk of paying the supreme price, the security personnel remained unrelenting in their resolve to keep the peace in Nigeria and deal with the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHis position came as troops killed 17 insurgents and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Borno and Rivers states.\n\nAddressing a group, God Bless Nigeria, which organised a solidarity march to the Defence Headquarters complex in Abuja, the defence chief vowed that enemies of the state would be brought to their knees.\n\nThe marchers carried banners with the inscription, \u201cArmed Forces Appreciation Day\u201d, in support of the country\u2019s security forces.\n\nThe defence chief, who was represented by the Director, Defence Information (DDI), Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said the military was committed to defeating the adversaries.\n\nNwachukwu stated while receiving the group, \u201cI welcome the God Bless Nigeria group on behalf of the Chief of Defence Staff, service chiefs and the entire military. We thank this very important group for taking time to appreciate the armed forces of Nigeria, to appreciate the conduct of operations we are carrying out around the country and the sacrifices our men are making in the conduct of those operations.\n\n\u201cRound the clock, our troops are engaged. We are not resting on our oars because we want to surmount this contemporary security challenges even though we are to pay the supreme price.\n\n\u201cWe can, of course, take a cue from what happened recently when the late Chief of Army Staff and a group officers were on a visit to Depot Nigerian Army (Kaduna) when they had the unfortunate mishap.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cLives were lost, families were orphaned, wives are widowed. We are paying expensively to ensure that we have peace in this country.\n\n\u201cI want to seize the opportunity on behalf of the Chief of Defence Staff and the leadership of the armed forces to assure Nigerians that we will not rest on our oars until we bring our adversaries to their knees.\u201d\n\nEarlier, spokesman of the God Bless Nigeria group, Mr Eric Ogolo, said, \u201cNo duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. We have come together to express our profound gratitude for the sacrifices, contributions, strength and commitment that you all display every single day.\n\n\u201cWhenever this country calls, you all are the ones who answer, no matter the circumstance, no matter the danger, no matter the sacrifice, and this you do with high morale.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian armed forces is not only our pride but also our super heroes, who fight all those hostile enemies, both external and internal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, just hours into the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, Boko Haram fighters attempted an audacious attack on troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Rann, the headquarters of Kala Balge Local Government Area of Borno State. An army statement said the terrorists came in their numbers with gun trucks and attempted to infiltrate the main entrance to the town.\n\nThe statement signed by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Mohammed Yerima, said, \u201cThe highly spirited troops were right on hand to counter the move and inflicted humiliating defeat on the terrorists who abandoned their evil mission and took to their heels.\n\n\u201cThe troops chased the retreating terrorist and ensured there was no further threat to the town and its residents. Troops successfully destroyed one of the gun trucks and recovered multiple weapons, including one anti aircraft gun, two machine guns and eight AK-47 rifles, neutralising 10 terrorists in the process.\u201d\n\nIn Port Harcourt, troops of 6 Division Garrison, Port Harcourt, and 29 Battalion in conjunction with operatives of Nigeria Police, Directorate of State Services (DSS), and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) conducted a clearance/raid operation at suspected IPOB/ESN enclaves at Agbomchia Forest along Pipeline Road, Ogali/Komkom Boundary, between Eleme and Oyigbo local government areas of Rivers State.\n\nAn army statement said, \u201cIn the fire fight that ensued during the clearance/raid operation, seven IPOB/ESN members were neutralised while five suspects arrested.\u201d\n\nIt also said, \u201cVarious items belonging to the criminals, including arms and ammunition, were also recovered by the security forces. The camp was promptly destroyed while suspects and corpses were handed over to the police for further action.\n\n\u201cThere was no casualty on own troops and other security operatives as they have returned back to base in high morale.\u201d\n\nThe army urged members of the public to help the troops with accurate and timely information that would assist them in tracking down and neutralising the criminal elements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The argument, the source said, was that an election from ward to states and eventually, national convention in the party would further divide the party at a time when it should be consolidating in the states\n\nIt was against this backdrop that some committee members, albeit with the consent Buni were considering presenting to the NEC that he should rather resign as governor and continue at the national convention, where he would be affirmed as the substantive national chairman of the party.\n\nThe source hinted that Buni did not spend up to four days a week in the state as he stays in Abuja most of the time..\n\nBefore winning the election to become the governor of Yobe State, he was the national secretary of APC, when Adams Oshiomhole was the national chairman.\n\nAlthough this has not been tabled before the NEC, members of the party, who should know were already protesting against the idea of members self-perpetuating themselves under any guise. Some of the members that did not want be quoted said they had concluded plans to seek legal action against any plans by the committee members to self-perpetuate in office\n\nAnother member told THISDAY that the Buni committee had already overstayed its welcome.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cWe were appointed to right the wrongs of Adams Oshiomhole, but this idea of not announcing the dates for the wards, local government, states and national convention.\n\nAnything outside announcing the dates of the national convention and other dates for the states congresses is outside our mandate.

          "title": "Osinbajo: FG Deploys Significant Resources to Address Challenges in Human Capital Devt",
          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nThe federal government has over the years deployed significant resources to address challenges in education and healthcare, in its efforts to address human capital development and related issues in the country, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has said.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President,\n\nLaolu Akande, quoted Osinbajo to have stated this yesterday in his keynote address at the Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola Leadership Colloquium 2021 themed: \u201cGovernment and Big Development: Realities & Solutions for Nigeria\u201d. The event was organised to mark the birthday of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nExplaining circumstances where governments may need to intervene directly, including in human capital development, the Vice President said, \u201cdirect state (government) intervention is crucial. You cannot have such conditions (such as in the country) and not have some direct interventions from government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point is that, for many of the challenges that face a developing economy, there is very little, immediate term profit for private actors in addressing those challenges, but of course, there are huge medium to long term social and economic gains to be reaped.\n\n\u201cIn order to fill that gap, government must come in, government must intervene. This intervention in my view, are the issues of big development. How do you educate the largest youth population in Africa?\n\n\u201cHow do you ensure healthcare for that large number of people, and all of the various issues? These are the big development issues that confront us. And we must be able to find solutions to them,\u201d he added.\n\nMaking reference to some specific interventions of the federal government, Osinbajo said, \u201cin our first budget, we devoted for N500 billion to our Social Investment Programme. 500,000 young graduates were engaged in the N-Power programme, and 9.5 million children being fed daily in the school feeding programme (just before COVID-19) across 34 states.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the programme employs well over 135,000 cooks, and over 100,000 small-holder farmers linked to the programme, supplying locally sourced ingredients.\n\nAt some point, this, he said translates to 594 cattle, 138,000 chickens, 6.8 million eggs, 83 metric tons of fish, that are procured, prepared, and distributed every week.\n\nThe higher outcomes for enrollment of pupils in school, retention and performance of students have all been empirically verified, he added.\n\n\u201cThere was also the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) \u2013 TraderMoni, MarketMoni initiatives where micro credits were offered to traders (about 2 million traders in all),\u201d the Vice President added.\n\nHe further explained that, \u201cthese programmes are important because they are in many ways government efforts at directly creating opportunities. A country such as ours clearly require a social welfare programme, a situation where those who cannot work and those who have no work and the vulnerable are provided with one way of earning something and provided with opportunities.\u201d\n\nIn the health sector, the Vice President said \u201csince the inception of this administration, we have done a few other direct social investment-type things aimed at human capital development.\n\n\u201cAfter the National Health Act was passed in 2014, the Federal Government in 2018 began including the one per cent minimum portion of the Consolidated Revenue Fund \u2013 amounting to N55 billion to fund the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF). The Fund is designed to deliver a guaranteed set of health services to all Nigerians, through the national network of Primary Health Care Centers.\u201d\n\nIn education, Osinbajo noted that, \u201csince 2015 also, the Federal Government has disbursed more than N170 billion in matching grants to States and the FCT under the Universal Basic Education Programme, N8 billion in Special Education Grants to states and private providers of Special Education, and N34 billion from the Teachers Professional Development Fund to States and the FCT.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Vice President added that the interventions were in line with the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment of lifting 100 million people out of poverty,\u201d noting that, \u201cwe recognise the threats posed by social immobility and deprivation.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on the cost of running the public service, the Vice President said the focus should be, \u201con people being in the right place in the public service. We have a large public service but you still have huge shortages in, for example, health and education sectors. So, there are massive shortages in many parts of the public service whereas you find redundancies in other aspects of the public service.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that, \u201cwe should be training and engaging more teachers, nurses, doctors and several other participants in the public service, and we may end up with more or less the same cost. But my view is that those costs themselves, so long that we are spending them right, so long as they are spent on the right quality of public servants, are costs that we should bear.\n\n\u201cI am not certain that just a willy-nilly cost cutting is the solution, long term. Of course, we find within the public service, so many who are not qualified, many whose jobs are replicated, huge redundancies, we need to correct those redundancies, we need to ensure that those who are not qualified are either retrained or we let them go.\n\n\u201cBut we must ensure that we do not allow ourselves to be trapped in a way of thinking that suggests that the problem is really just the cost of governance, so that if we just downsize, everything will be alright. I think the problem is a bit larger than that. I think we have to look at really, the professionalisation of our public service, ensuring that we have the right quality of people in the right jobs,\u201d Osinbajo added.\n\nCommending the efforts of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, as governor of Osun State, and describing him as \u201ca repentant Marxist\u201d, the Vice President said, \u201che stands out as a reason why one should at least have some socialist blood in them while recognising the fundamental role of markets and the public sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOsun State which Ogbeni governed for 8 years received the lowest in federal allocations but was for those years, the State with the lowest poverty rate. The incidence of poverty for the State of Osun was 10.9 per cent in 2017 as against 37.5 per cent in 2010.\n\n\u201cA sharp drop in the incidence of poverty between 2010 and 2018. As of early 2020 the incidence of poverty has fallen further to 8.2 per cent. Why would a State with one of the least revenues record lowest levels of poverty?\n\n\u201cTo a large extent, it is arguable that the social intervention policies he initiated and implemented were largely responsible. The State launched several job creation efforts \u2013 Osun State Youth Empowerment Program (OYES) hired about 20,000 young people.\n\n\u201cThere was also the school feeding programme, the precursor to our National Homeschool Feeding Programme, serving 155,000 children at inception to over 250,000 children in all 1,382 public elementary schools in the State. 7000 jobs were directly created and 3700 cooks, most of them women.\n\n\u201cThe programme led to an increase of 60 per cent in primary school enrollment and all meals served were from farms and suppliers of food items benefitted from the programme.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin : personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\n: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin. There are the warranty papers but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for is it? Thought as much. Onward!\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",
          "summary": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country.\nIt has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects.\nBut the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook.\nAccording to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria.\nKaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more? The reliability of a browser that hasn\u2019t passed the test of time? How much work do you think Edge has to do to catch up with Chrome?

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations? Read\n\nWhat you need to know, as Kenya moves to outlaw pornography.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re following\n\nDubai is a paradise for \u201cdigital nomads\u201d \u2014 and hell for low-wage gig workers.

          "text": "Twenty-two years ago, on May 29, 1999, Nigeria returned to civil rule. The military which had held power for many years decided to relinquish the power. But the country has yet to wean itself off the problems left behind by the \u201ckhaki boys\u201d.\n\nIn fact, things have grown worse. There can be no better way to put it!\n\nMany Nigerians are today lamenting: if this is living, dying is better! That it is suffocating here is to put it mildly.\n\nIn 22 years, the quality of life of Nigerians has not improved. Nigerians have grown farther apart. The economy has grown from bad to worse, to the point that all the tiers of government are contemplating reducing the minimum wage, which was nothing to write home about in the first place.\n\nThe powers that be have become very nepotistic in all their doings to the point that the country has been further balkanized.\n\nAt the return to civil rule 22 years ago, hope was high that life was going to be grand as the military handed over power to a democratically elected President Olusegun Obasanjo in a colourful ceremony in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nThe mood was upbeat and the new president had promised prosperity to the millions of his countrymen who had massed out at the Eagle Square venue of the inauguration.\n\nThose who had no opportunity to be physically present at the venue glued to their television screen and radio speakers to listen to the speech of the new leader.\n\nToday, such speeches no longer move a needle. Many Nigerians have grown weary of what appear to be empty claims of sterling performance that does not positively change their lives.\n\nThe economy has receded, worsened by the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. In a space of five years in the life of the current administration, the country suffered two recessions.\n\nThe country has an unenviable record of being the poverty headquarters of the world. A country naturally endowed with natural resources has not been able to leverage the blessing to the good of the citizenry.\n\nREAD ALSO: The face of poverty in Nigeria\n\nAlthough the world is shifting attention to crude oil, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, is still heavily reliant on oil. Petroleum represents more than 80 percent of total export revenue here, according to the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nNo lesson was learnt in 2016 when the global oil price crashed, terribly affecting Nigeria\u2019s economy. That was when the country went into a recession, its first in 25 years.\n\nThe Covid-19-induced recession of last year could have been avoided if there had been a conscious effort at diversifying beyond the lip service paid to it.\n\nThe advice by experts to government to walk the talk on the diversification of the nation\u2019s economy has not been heeded.\n\nThe experts believe that Nigeria needs to tap into the agricultural sector where the country can put millions of the unemployed to work.\n\nIt is their view that investment in infrastructure will also put many young people to work and reduce inflation.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) figures, unemployment rate in the country increased to 33.30 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 27.10 percent in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s headline inflation rate for March 2021 rose to 18.17 percent from 17.33 percent recorded in February.\n\nMajor reason for this is that Nigeria\u2019s environment has become so tough for businesses that many companies have either closed shop or executed major salary cuts and layoffs of their employees.\n\nThe situation got worse since the worldwide outbreak of Covid-19.\n\nDespite the booms Nigeria had enjoyed, it did not save for the rainy day, hence widespread extreme poverty among the populace.\n\nThe latest report by World Poverty Clock has shown that more Nigerians have been plunged into extreme poverty since 2019. The latest figure shows that 105 million Nigerians now live in extreme poverty.\n\nAmong other vices that have retarded the economic growth of Nigeria are corruption and nepotism.\n\nThe country still remains one of the most corrupt nations on the planet. Transparency International still ranked Nigeria topmost in its latest corruption perceptions index.\n\nIn one of its reports, some years back, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a global auditing firm, said if corruption was not dealt with immediately, it could cost Nigeria up to 37 percent of its GDP by 2030.\n\nAlthough all the administrations that had presided over power since 1999 claimed one of their priorities was to rid the country off corruption, they have encouraged corruption in various ways. The current government appears to have taken corruption to a higher level by announcing that whoever that joins their party would not be prosecuted. Hence, the mass defection to the party by politicians that have corruption allegations hanging on their neck.\n\nNigeria has also been overrun by bandits, insurgents and kidnappers, making life so difficult for innocent citizens.\n\nThe Federal Government seems to have been overwhelmed as those expected to lead from the front are now pronouncing openly that the country is at a crossroads.\n\nSince 2009, the North Eastern Nigeria has been hit by security challenges. The Islamist sect, Boko Haram, a group that wants to establish an Islamic state following a strict interpretation of Islamic law, has waged a deadly insurgency.\n\nThe low-grade war has claimed the lives of thousands of people and forced millions of others to flee their homes.\n\nThe activities of bandits and Fulani herdsmen across the country have driven farmers away from their farms. The rampaging of herdsmen has become so rampant that geopolitical zones in the country have resorted to self help as it appears the Federal Government is not sincerely addressing the issue.\n\nAt no other time since the civil war have Nigerians lived in such a fear that people no longer sleep with their two eyes closed than now.\n\nFrom the kidnap of over 270 school girls in Chibok in 2014, kidnapping of school children in various parts of the North has become an everyday affair under the nose of government.\n\nREAD ALSO: Poverty and Widening Inequality in Nigeria\n\nKidnapping for ransom has become the in-thing in Nigeria despite the castrated warning by government against payment of ransom.\n\nTwenty-two years after return to civil rule, Nigerians have grown farther apart, with many more people and ethnic nationalities clamouring for restructuring or outright secession.\n\nThe ongoing constitutional amendment being embarked upon by the National Assembly is a pointer that the country is sick.\n\nEven at that, many people believe that there is no amount of tinkering of the 1999 Constitution that could heal Nigeria\u2019s putrefying sore; they are rather demanding a brand-new document.\n\nAt a public forum recently, Nnia Nwodo, immediate past president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said the 1999 Constitution was not a document to be relied upon in the governance of a nation.\n\n\u201cForty-nine people were selected to write a constitution. Forty people in the Supreme Military Council promulgated a constitution under General (Abdulsami) Abubakar, a government in which I served. I was in the Executive Council, I never saw that constitution, but I was the minister of information. It was my responsibility to publicise it to the country,\u201d Nwodo said.\n\n\u201cOn the day of swearing-in of (Olusegun) Obasanjo, we didn\u2019t have a copy of the constitution. I didn\u2019t know who was printing it and my ministry was supposed to pay for the printing. And Obasanjo was sworn in on a constitution that had not been read by anybody, and the National Assembly could not be constituted until four days after his swearing in, because there was no clean copy of the constitution. We cannot build on quicksand. A country can\u2019t live on falsehood,\u201d he said.\n\nTwenty-two years after return to civil rule, there is actually no freedom of speech or association, as government harasses citizens and intimidates those who hold different opinions from them. Many people strongly believe that Nigeria is still under the jackboot.\n\nNigerians are, indeed, yearning for a breath of fresh air.",

          "text": "A fresh move toward the amendment of Nigeria\u2019s 1999 Constitution began Wednesday, May 26, 2021 with the National Assembly conducting a two-day public hearing across the country.\n\nThe programme, which was organised by the Senate Committee on Constitution Review, saw federal lawmakers tour different regions in the country to get the perspectives of Nigerians and stakeholders.\n\nThe hearing was held in 12 venues nationwide.While Jos and Minna hosted the public hearing in the North Central geopolitical zone; that of North East and North West was held in Bauchi and Gombe as well as Kaduna and Sokoto, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, that of South East held in Owerri and Enugu, while South-South had theirs in Port Harcourt and Asaba. Akure and Lagos served as centres for South West.\n\nThere had been previous efforts and attempts by the National Assembly to amend the 1999 Constitution, they were not successful.However, the current attempt was eagerly awaited by Nigerians due to the multifarious problems bedeviling Nigeria and the current state of the country, which had fueled increased secessionist agitations and clamour for restructuring of the country, among other issues.\n\nIn the last few weeks since the committee announced the date for the public hearing, there have been discordant tunes among Nigerians, political leaders and other stakeholders on what they want changed or added into the constitution and even the necessity of the amendment exercise.\n\nSome Nigerians have also made case for a brand-new document, saying that the current constitution must be discarded.\n\nAmong the issues that topped therequestsof Nigerians in the two-day exercise across the country were the creation of state police, devolution of powers to the states, creation of more states, restructuring and fiscal federalism.\n\nInterestingly, while some Nigerians such as the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, advocated a return to the 1963 Constitution, his counterpart in Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa called for a new constitution and not an amendment of the 1999 document.\n\nBut in Lagos, Governor, BabajideSanwo-Olu, canvassed a special status for the state, which was a former capital of the country.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in its presentation sought the retention of the minimum wage, among other demands, while local government workers under the aegis of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) asked the lawmakers to make local governments autonomous.\n\nMeanwhile, political watchers have equally faulted the current attempt to amend the 1999 Constitution, doubting its ability to produce any desirable outcome capable of solving Nigeria\u2019s immediate problems.\n\nThey say that what the country needed now was the convocation of a national conference to accommodate all opinions on how to move the country forward in view of the state of the country.\n\nOthers have even doubted the sincerity of incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari to sign the amended constitution into law even if it even scales through the tough and rigour hurdles of amendment.\n\nAlso, some sections of Nigerians are of the view that a major issue that must be dealt with was the culture of impunity, which must go in line with a new constitution, rather than amending the existing one.\n\n\u201cWell, personally I am really worried about the culture of impunity in Nigeria which has become part of us. I mean, you can do anything and likely get away with it; people must be held accountable for their actions.\n\n\u201cI do not support the amendment of the 1999 Constitution and I have doubts about this whole process. I don\u2019t think it would work. There are question marks on the sincerity of the lawmakers to me. I would rather want a new one instead, is it not obvious that the current constitution cannot solve our problems?\u201d Bunmi Lawal, analyst and political historian, said.\n\nAfe Babalola, a senior advocate of Nigeria, saidamending the 1999 Constitution, as proposed, is a futile exercise.\n\nHe expressed doubts that amending the constitution will be inadequate to fully address the nation\u2019s problems, stressing that the only constitution that could be worked on to make a difference remained the 1963 Constitution.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAlternatively, since amendment in law includes substitution for an existing document, why is it that the National Assembly cannot call for a public hearing on the substitution of the 1999 Constitution for the 1963 Constitution which was made with the consent of the people?\n\n\u201cAgainst the background of the massive demand by Nigerians at home and abroad for a true Federal constitution made by the people and for the people, the National Assembly is calling for public hearing in the country\u2019s six geo-political zones for people\u2019s input on any issue of interest to enable it amend the 1999 constitution, but I have reservations on this.\n\n\u201cThe root cause of the nation\u2019s current problems is the 1999 Constitution foisted on Nigeria by the military. It is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 Constitution is wound round the Presidential system of government.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe all know that previous sessions of the National Assembly made laws to convene a national conference. I, therefore, advise that the current National Assembly should call for a national conference to discuss and make a new, true Federal constitution which will provide for a parliamentary system of government.\u201d\n\nOlisaAgbakoba, a senior advocate of Nigeria, however, is of the view that changing the 1999 Constitution may not guarantee a perfect country, saying that the current constitution, in spite of its imperfections, is not being complied with by political leaders.\n\n\u201cTo force a change of constitution outside the legal framework will be considered a revolution. Let\u2019s not assume that a perfect constitution that we all strive for means that by a flick of the switch everything is good.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the constitution, imperfect as it is, is not obeyed. So, what is the guarantee to say that the constitution we envisage will be obeyed? The answer to it is something we should reflect on carefully.\n\n\u201cSo, as we plan towards strategic intervention in changing the dynamics of the Nigerian states and in placing a new constitution, let\u2019s not overlook the small advantages that we can get by critical engagement,\u201dAgbakoba said.\n\nFormer national Publicity Secretary of the Action Democratic Party (ADP),Adelaja Adeoye said the amendment had become desirable to meet the yearning of Nigerians, stressing that the current structure of the country was faulty.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs it stands today, the 1999 Constitution does not represent the generality of all Nigerians, and it does not give the people the right as a secular state, because it does not maintain the religious neutrality as it should maintain, therefore, I want all the obnoxious and partial laws in the constitution be expunged from our constitution, and a new constitution that will guarantee rights of all Nigerians without infringing on others\u2019 economically, politically, socially, spiritually and others, must be enacted.\n\nAdeoye further said: \u201cIn our quest for a more functional country, the restructuring, devolution of powers, review of revenue-sharing formula, creation of more states and federating units for zonal balancing, rejiging of federal character for appointments, federal, state and community policing must start from this amendment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the Constitution review exercise on Channels Television interview, Friday, Governor Udom Emmanuel urged the National Assembly ensure the credibility and sincerity of the whole process.\n\nThe governor said that some important personalities that would have attended the public hearing in their zone stayed away simply because they were not sure anything worthwhile would come out of the exercise.\n\n\u201cPeople are asking question- what happened to the Electoral Bill? The National Assembly has not delivered on that. How are we sure the public hearing is not just about buying time? That is the question my people are asking here,\u201d Emmanuel said.\n\nAt a public forum recently, Nnia Nwodo, immediate past president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said the 1999 Constitution was not a document to be relied upon in the governance of a nation.\n\nNwodo said: \u201cForty-nine people were selected to write a constitution. Forty people in the Supreme Military Council promulgated a constitution under General (Abdulsami) Abubakar, a government in which I served. I was in the Executive Council, I never saw that constitution, but I was the minister of information. It was my responsibility to publicise it to the country.

He admonished ACGs to design\n\nempathy maps to help them in understanding how people experienced a problem in their communities and their perspectives about finding solutions or responding to requests for proposals, whether solicited or unsolicited.\n\nIn the functions of Resource Mobilisation, he stated that finding \u201cnew business opportunities\u201d is same as proposal development, and after action, review process followed before project implementation. He however cautioned that service provision to clients should not be discontinued but that organisational sustainability will help scale up goods and services the organisation currently provides.\n\nHe listed resource Mobilisation sources to include members contribution, sale of goods and services for user fees, foundation contributions, government contracts, grants, national and international donors, amongst others.\n\nDr Emonena noted that there were certain truths about resource Mobilisation, and they included that organisations are not entitled to supports but that it depended on what organisations bring to the table, and that gaining trust/confidence will aid search for supports.\n\n\u201cSuccessful Resource Mobilisation requires a lot of work and takes a lot of time. Organisations need to be thoroughly prepared. If your organization needs additional revenue in one year, start today!\u2019 he stated emphatically.\n\nHe admonished participants to be ready, willing and able to sell the programme they are raising fund for and be sure that fund mobilisation efforts are in alliance with organization\u2019s mission, objectives and strategic plans. He however noted that fundraising is also about the needs of the prospective donor.\n\n\u201cYou must understand the needs of your constituents or markets and apply an evidence-based research on what works. Your organisational performance today impacts on your ability to generate resources tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOrganizational, programmatic, industrial and financial sustainability, according to Dr Emonena, are key for organizational optimal performance.\n\nOn his part, Dr Jude Obasanmi took participants through an organizational development\n\nchecklist, which includes need for self assessment, action planning, development of Resource Mobilisation Plan and the internal/external Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats(SWOT), including\n\nLeadership and Governance, stating that organisations must be governed by documented constitution, constituted CSO Board and meeting, visible NGO vision, mission and value statement, organizational chart, NGO strategy plan, and so forth.\n\n\u201cSocial Innovation has a new formula for success, and it is combining capital with a do- good mentality.\u201d Dr Obasanmi stated.\n\nThe training also considered the process of proposal development from formation of team and calendar, technical approach, methodology and project description, monitoring and evaluation plan, among other sub-titles, including the Theory of Change,\n\nNetworking and referral systems.\n\nHighpoint of the training was the distribution of a sample of an Organization Resource Mobilisation Plan, 2021-2023 to participants, and it included Projected Resource Needs for FP/AYSRH, 2021 to 2023, a three-year planning map.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL), publishers of the Observer Titles celebrates her 53 years of existence today.\n\nThe Company was established by Late Brigadier General Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia on May 29, 1968 during his tenure as the then Midwest State.\n\nIt was one of the first major attempts to set up a government owned newspaper after independence in 1960\n\nGovernment involvement in setting up media establishment became pronounced with Nigeria independence and subsequently becoming a republic in 1963 with its import of politics in a clearer term.\n\nAfter independence in 1960, the federal government came up with the MORNING AND SUNDAY POST and NEW NIGERIA which grew out of the defunct CITIZEN. The western Region government also established DAILY SKETCH and SUNDAY SKETCH in 1964, while the Midwestern State government set up the Midwest Newspapers Corporation under an edit of December 2, 1967 to produce THE Nigerian OBSERVER newspapers which was first published on May 29, 1968.\n\nThe idea of publishing a government owned Newspaper in the state was first conceived by Colonel Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia\u2019s predecessor, Governor David Ejoor while in office.\n\nThe name of the paper originally planned for the state was \u201cMidwestern Nigeria Sentinel\u201d which was to be a weekly newspaper. The plan to set it up did not materialize before Colonel Ogbemudia was posted to take over as Governor of the then Midwest State.\n\nWithin a brief period of conception, ogbemudia invited Mr Abiodun Aloba in 1967, whom he entrusted the task of helping to set up a state-owned newspaper. Mr Aloba later became the pioneer General Manager of The Nigerian OBSERVER. He had come from Lagos on holiday to Benin City to see his relations. On his way back to Lagos, he was held back by some soldiers, who told him the Military Governor wanted to see him.\n\nOn meeting the Governor, after a brief on the proposal, Aloba was taken to several locations in Benin City with a view of choosing a befitting location for the newspaper company.\n\nHowever, after much search, the governor personally zeroed in on the present site, No. 24 Airport Road, then No. 18 Airport Road; a site which originally belonged to the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nToday, The Nigerian OBSERVER remains the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country after series of re-launching and re-designing to meet industry standard.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER in 1972 was circulating about 95,000 copies of its editions daily, a number which today has reduced to less than 1000.\n\nLate Fred Opubor, a one time chairman of the company\u2019s Board of Directors blamed the fall in circulation of government owned newspapers on interference on editorial policy.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER was a child of political necessity published as a document for daily circulation that would inform the public on activities of government of the then Midwestern State Fifty-three years after establishment, The Nigerian OBSERVER has to its credit, three editions: Daily, The Sunday OBSERVER and The Weekend OBSERVER on October 6, 1990.\n\nWhile the Sunday OBSERVER was established on October 27,1968, the Sporting OBSERVER (now defunct) was established in 1974 and the Weekend OBSERVER in October 6,1990.\n\nAs at the 4th anniversary of the establishment of the corporation, the daily circulation of The Nigeria OBSERVER throughout the then 12 states of the federation has risen to 95,000, while The Sunday OBSERVER maintained a steady circulation n of 180,000 copies weekly.\n\nFollowing the creation of Edo and Delta States from the then Bendel State in 1991, and subsequently sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. Edo retained Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL).\n\nThe government of Delta State, on its part, set up Delta Printing Press on August 8, 1994 to produce a state owned newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper which was later known as THE POINTER first appeared on the news stand in October 25, 1994.\n\nIt was set up basically to accommodate staff of the Bendel Newspaper Company Limited who were displaced from the company following the sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. It was also a newspaper meant to project Delta state with its people to the outside world, as well as bring the world closer to Delta people.\n\nThe publication which started as weekly newspaper that was published every Sunday later added Thursdays and Saturdays (weekend) editions while it is presently a daily publication.\n\nThe basis for establishing THE POINTER newspaper was developmental journalism and grass root enlightenment, specifically patterned along the line of regional newspaper.\n\nWithin the first decade of its existence, the name Midwest Newspaper Corporation was subjected to geo-political changes that affected the political structure at the federal level.\n\nFirstly, it was Midwest Mass Communication Corporation and following the creation of more states, including Bendel from the defunct Midwest State, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Corporation.\n\nAfter several reforms, in January 1, 1989, in a bid to accentuate its news value and determination, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL), a name which is retained till date.\n\nThe decision to change the name was taken at management level as a means to deliberately strip the company of all elements that made it a parastatal. It was subsequently registered under the Company Allied Matters Act.\n\nDespite the change in the legal status of the company, it is today still owned by government which retained every element of control and management.\n\nAt the inception of Midwest Newspapers Corporation in 1968, the then governor of the state, Colonel Ogbemudia observed that if The Nigerian OBSERVER publication is to discharge its sacred function effectively and efficiently too, it should be free from government control as to what it should write and not write. It should be free to criticize any aspect of government policy which it considered worthy of criticism in public.\n\nNevertheless, The OBSERVER Newspapers thrived in the face of challenges and competitions from privately owned newspapers, to emerge as the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country.\n\nThe newspaper also had its fair share of unfavorable moments, both during the military regime and civilian government.\n\nA case in point was the case between one Mr. Amakiri Minere (now late) and the then River State governor, Alfred Diette Spiff (now a traditional ruler in Rivers State) in July 1973. Amakiri was the River State correspondent of the Benin \u2013Based The Nigerian OBSERVER. He wrote about an impending Teachers\u2019 strike in River state and had it published on the Military Governor\u2019s birthday anniversary. Diette Spiff felt insulted about the reportage and saw it as well calculated news to embarrass his personality.\n\nThe governor\u2019s ADC, ASP Ralph Micheal Iwowari intervened to pacify his paymaster (Diette) and sent for the reporter. Ignorantly, the reporter appeared at the gate of the governor\u2019s house and was received and detained by soldiers until further orders. The governor ordered and supervised the soldiers shaving of Amakiri\u2019s head with a broken bottle and caned 24 times publicly.\n\nThere was public outcry over the insult and injury caused Amakiri by Governor Diette Spiff and his aides to the extent that Amakiri\u2019s case is today a case study in any discuss on Press Freedom both in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nIn July 22, 1993, General Ibrahim Babagida closed The N igerian OBSERVER newspapers and some other national newspapers for their reportage on the June 12 crisis which he considered as a criticism against his administration.\n\nAside these, in the 1980s, the Newspaper house began to experience some difficulties principally among which was declined readers into the hands of privately owned newspaper until recently when the Editorial appeal was reignited by a vibrant youthful journalist, Mr. Eddy Akpomera. The daily product won back a high number of readers and advertisers who appreciated quality product.\n\nPrior to this period, situation became worse when the then Military Administrator of Edo State, Group Captain Baba Adamu Iyam introduced self- sustenance policy where BNCL and other parastatals were asked to fend for themselves through a Self- Sustenance. Workers of the company started going on incessant strikes as management could not afford workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThis ugly experience continued until Governor Lucky Nosakhare Igbinedion came to the aid of the company. He cleared off the company\u2019s backlog of 13 months\u2019 salary arrears and employed the services of consultants made up of the duo of Emeka Ogbeide and Orobosa Omo-Ojo who revived the company and put it back on a sound footing.\n\nOn the note of advancing the newspaper house, Edo state Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki after paying an unscheduled visit to The Nigerian OBSERVER, revealed his intention of revamping the state owned media, including The Nigerian OBSERVER with the installation of a state of the art Printing Machine.\n\nHowever, it is on record that the 53 years old Newspaper produced notable journalists some of who made marks in journalism profession, including Mrs. Adekumbi Ero, Nosa Igiebor of TELL magazine, Osa Director, Emma Niboro, Nduka Obaiggbena, publishers of THIS DAY Newspaper.\n\n...",

          "title": "Governor Oyetola and the Chinese fable, by Charles Adeyemi",
          "text": "Before the rinderpest, I came across a well-known fable from Chinese mythology about the virtues of willpower and perseverance as a regular adherent of the Confucian doctrine of social co-existence. Wikipedia would discover that the tale first appeared in Book 5 of the Liezi, a Daoist text of the 4th century BC, and was retold in the Garden of Stories by the Confucian scholar Liu Xiang in the 1st century BC. It was also used by Chairman Mao Tsetung, the first premier of the people\u2019s republic of China in his famous speech of 1945.\n\nThe myth concerns an Old Man of 90 years who lived near a pair of mountains in the Yu Province. He was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains and sought to dig through them with hoes and baskets. To move the mountain, he could only make one round trip between the mountain and his home in a year. When questioned as to the seemingly impossible nature of his task, the Old Man replied that while he may not finish this task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children, and their children, and so on through the many generations, some day the mountains would be removed if he persevered. The gods in Heaven, impressed with his determination, hard work and perseverance, ordered the mountains separated.\n\nDrawing the Nexus, it takes an unusual willpower ganished with brilliance and a total believe in the miracle working God to lead a state like osun in 2018. The last Administration has given their best but majority of Osun people and spectators of Governance of Osun doesn\u2019t see the state rising from the toga of issues it was confronted with prior to the Advent of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nFor instance, Osun was a state popular with all sort of complications ranging from reactions to different policies and initiatives of the system, from school merger, to single school uniform policy, to avoidable religious crisis, attempt at building of a cargo airport which many believe was a white elephant adventure. for a protracted period of time, workers were subjected to modulated salary option which was popularly reffered to \u2018Afusa\u2019, funny as it was then, the senior staff of government were collecting half salary, the brutal situation is not even the half salary but that all status quo deductions were implemented to the full from the supposed modulated salary. Bank deductions never stopped, gratuity payment for pensioners were also modulated, cooperative deductions were used by the system of that time leaving an average workers with empty pocket.\n\nOf course, the sad effect was conspicuous and felt in the entire state, it made the narrative popular that Osun is a civil service state. By the time the last Administration was winding down, it became obvious that a new approach must be explored, a new agenda must be sought for, yet premised on the continuity mantra. Ogbeni Aregbesola, the former Governor and current minister of interior accented to this when he publicly told osun people to expect a new approach and probably a reversal of some of his policies should they felt it\u2019s necessary, they can tell the party and the party will relate to Ilerioluwa. He admonished them to expect Ilerioluwa to do things differently. A prophecy that would come to pass sooner.\n\nTalking of willpower and determination, the alpha shock started when the current Governor started telling people of Osun that he will pay full salaries as and when due to the workers of osun.\n\nTruth be told, even top members of the party hierarchy both in the state and federal dispell this promise as a mere campaign contents to sway votes, what was clear to all then was that osun has bitten more than she can chew and future generations will continue to pay for it with obvious punishment such as \u201cAfusa\u201d and it\u2019s attendant hardship on the people of Osun. The second category of people that doubt this campaign promise by candidate Oyetola were the workers! Yes they are the worst hit by the \u2018Afusa\u2019 tsunami, imagine working for a month and collecting half of your normal salary with full deductible deductions.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has not only fulfill his promise of paying full salaries, he has went further to approve minimum wage for all levels of Osun workforce, isn\u2019t this a miracle? An illustration of dry bone rising again, yet infrastructural development hasn\u2019t stop for a single day!\n\nPeople begin to wonder how the man of the moment is doing it, questions like what\u2019s the secret? the magic and whatever is it should be shared for younger generation to learn. An economic expert, Dr Ogunyemi said it takes a miracle worker to do what Oyetola is doing. Is this hard to know?\n\nI find out it\u2019s about prudence in Public Financial Management (PFM), a process by which money comes into the purse of the government and the process by which goverment expend the money through implementation of project and services.This is the premise on which the financial encyclopedia based his fiscal governance on.\n\nOsun Government under the leadership of Governor Oyetola has been able to develop Medium Term Sector Strategy (MTSS) and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which has been assisting the state in preparing realistic budget since 2018.\n\nThe budget performance of the state government of osun is available on the state website (www.stateofosun.gov.ng). Both national and international partners in the area of public finance has credited osun as one of the states that has developed and signed into law virtually all financial management laws.\n\nWithin two years of his Adminstration, the payment system of internally generated revenue has been digitalized, this is in line with blocking all loopholes and thus remitted IGR skyrocketed in an ever increasing scale. To solidify this system, State of Osun Audit law of 2018, which provides the legal backup for the office of the Auditor General for the state and Auditor Generals for the local governments was signed into law and later within the same first two years, Osun Public Financial Management law 2020 was also accented.\n\nThe Administration has invested heavily on ICT via State integrated financial management information system (SIFIMIS) which assist the administration in Setting realistic budget. The Gboyega Oyetola Administration has put in place a robust procurement system and auditing institutions has also been repositioned.\n\nIn recognition of all this fiscal efforts, SFTAS (State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project) rated Osun among the top in public financial management in Nigeria. This is a world bank funded project alongside federal government of Nigeria. At the end of their fact finding mission accross the country which includes but not limited to evaluation of Budget Preparation process, budget performance process, public procurement process, financial accounting process, auditing process and even revenue collection process. They declared osun one of the best in the entire country.\n\nAnother project that played a key role in osun fiscal governance is SLOGOR (State and Local Governance Reform Project). Under Governor Oyetola leadership, SLOGOR has repositioned the fiscal space in the State of osun and can compete with comity of performing States, it has been adjudged by the World Bank Assisted State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project as one of the best in Nigeria. The project has open the State Of Osun to budget support from international development community.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has repositioned the fiscal governance of osun than before. Within the armbit of international development organizations like WORLD BANK, UNESCO, European Union (EU), United Kingdom Department for International Development ( DFID) and others, they are now seeing osun as a state they can partner with. They are more willing than before to support the government. These are development partners that can\u2019t inject their money into a system that\u2019s not transparent.\n\nAll osun audit reports are on the osun website and this has raise the level of confidence of donors and development partners. It can only happened when you have a thourougbred professional and technocrats in power. There\u2019s more to be done and osun people are willing to give a man with Will power, determination, and perseverance in the thoughts that things can be better.\n\nOsun couldn\u2019t have Achieve so much with so little if not for financial mastery and prudence of the Governor. A Bantu proverb situates that \u201cWhen money realizes that it is in good hands, it wants to stay and multiply in those hands.\u201d this is the testimony of our grass to grace fiscal reality in osun, the reason why we must insist on retaining Governor Gboyega Oyetola to continue this frugal display of financial mastery, discipline and brilliant fiscal governance.\n\nForward With Governor Gboyega Oyetola forever!\n\nCharles Adeyemi writes from osogbo.

A good leader will call those with grievances for discussion. Instead of using the police and army to fight your home citizens and killing them, call them to a round table discussion.\n\n\u201cBuhari should call Nnamdi Kanu saying look \u201cyou are my son what is your problem? Can\u2019t we build a better Nigeria?\n\nHow do you want Biafra?\u2019 Kanu will say, \u201cfather, this is how I want Biafra\u2019 and Buhari will say no, let\u2019s have a round table discussion to solve this problem.\u2019\n\nREAD ALSO: Police arrest 4 over illegal possession of pistol\u2026\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, if Buhari does this, Nnamdi Kanu will see him as a father that cares for his son and would stop all these things.

These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its development partners, have a platform of Senior Supervisors that engage in daily evening review meetings to determine the status of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation in all States & the FCT.\u201d",

          "text": "On Saturday, parents and family members of the abducted Greenfield university students revealed that they were compelled to sell their property in order to raise ransom money while the remaining victims were released.\n\nRemember that the robbers who kidnapped the students sought N100 million in ransom as well as ten new bikes.\n\nNEWS DIRECT previously reported that bandits released 13 students and three staff members of Greenfield University on Saturday along the Kaduna-Abuja Expressway, a few kilometers from the institution.\n\nThis comes after robbers assassinated five pupils after their parents failed to acquire the N800 million ransom demanded by the captors.\n\nThe Kaduna State Police Command spokesman, Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the release of the remaining students and workers after 39 days in captivity.\n\nJalige when asked of their health status, the police spokesman said once debriefed, \u201cwe will get back to you.\u201d\n\nThe police, however, did not disclose whether or not a ransom was paid, it was learnt that parents paid some unspecified amount to the bandits.\n\nThe bandits, however, reduced the ransom to N100m and 10 motorcycles and later asked the parents to pay N10m for each victim.\n\nAccording to Punch, reliable sources disclosed that the parents paid the ransom and bought eight brand new motorcycles to the bandits before the students regained their freedom.\n\nThe aggrieved parents blamed both the federal and state governments as well as the Nigeria Police Force for their approach in securing the release of the abducted.\n\nThey said they had to sell their assets to secure the release of their children from the bandits, who had earlier vowed to kill them if their demands were not met.\n\nOne of the freed staff members, Mrs Bassey, thanked God that they were returned safely and reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cI gave God all the glory that we returned safely. They tried to take care of us. We are eating normally,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother parent, Mr Bassey Bassey expressed joy over the release of his daughter.\n\nHe, however, expressed disappointment that Nigerian children had no future with the attitude of governments.\n\nBassey said, \u201cAfter 40 days of trauma, trouble, confusion, disappointment that the future of Nigerian children was kidnapped, we are very happy that we see them again alive.\n\n\u201cBut it is disappointing that both federal and state governments could not lift a finger to secure their release. No government showed any intention to help. It was parents that rallied around to ensure that the students were released.\n\n\u201cWe paid a huge amount of money to secure their release. The people (bandits) collected several motorbikes which we had to give because our destiny was tied up.\n\n\u201cThere was no effort, no fight by government or security agencies to get them freed. We suffered and sold all our properties to rescue our children. No government, no security agencies that came to help us. It is shameful that those who did not contribute anything came out to take the glory.\n\n\u201cNow is not a time to take that decision of returning our children to that school. The school authority tried well. We will take that decision later.\u201d\n\nMr Chukwuemeka Lawrence, a husband of one of the kidnapped workers, insisted that huge amounts were paid as ransom.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe paid ransom before they were released. The kidnappers called us and told us that government is behind them; that the government knows what they are doing and that we should look for more money.\n\n\u201cWe begged them but they refused to listen to our pleas. We sold houses. The total amount we paid was N150m. I cannot hide the truth. The government promised to protect us but they are not doing so. How can my wife go to work for two days and I will be paying over N5m? I can\u2019t hide the truth. That is what is killing us in this country.\u201d\n\nBut in a video that went viral on Saturday, a parent who did not give his name said N180m was collected as ransom.\n\nHe said, \u201cN180m; that is what they collected from us parents, without the help of the government. None of the government officials came to our aid. Since the 20th of April they took these children, the government did not release a single policeman to go after them despite the dead bodies that have been brought. We say we have a government, I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t have any government. We only have those that are selfish for themselves and not for the masses.\u201d",

          "text": "The 16 abducted students and staff of Greenfield University, Kasarami, Chikun local government of Kaduna state have been released after 39 days in captivity.\n\nBandits stormed Greenfield University on April 20th, 2021 killing a gateman for attempting to shut the game against them, before kidnapping 19 students and three female staff of the university. Five of the students were later killed by the bandits, before parents of one of them paid some ransom to secure his freedom.\n\nThe remaining three female staff and 13 students were released Saturday afternoon near Ollam Farms along Kaduna \u2013 Abuja highway after the payment of an unspecified amount as ransom by the parents. The freed captives were taken over by some security men around the Ollam Farms ostensibly to hand them over to the police authorities.\n\nBut this infuriated the angry parents who broke into Ollam Farms to pick their children and wives. They lamented what they described as federal and state governments\u2019 nonchalant attitude to the safe release of the students and staff.\n\n\n\nAccording to the parents despite several pleas and appeals, neither Kaduna state government nor security agents made efforts to secure their release. Adding that they had to sell their assets and valuables to secure the release of their children and wives.\n\nThe students and staff who were looking unkept, traumatic and in poor state of health were later reunited with their parents and families at Reg View Hotel, Television Garage near Command junction, Chikun local government area of Kaduna state in an emotional reunion amidst jubilation and sobs.\n\nOne of the abducted but freed staff, Mrs Bassey expressed appreciation to God that they were returned safely and reunited with their families. She said the bandits took good care of them and gave them normal food.\n\n\u201cI give God all the glory that we returned safely. They tried in taking care of us. We are eating normally,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on what the release of his daughter meant to him and his family, Mr Bassey Bassey said it was a day of joy and happiness for them. \u201cAfter 40 days of trauma, trouble, confusion, disappointment that the future of Nigeria, children of Nigeria were kidnapped we are very happy that we see them again alive.\n\n\u201cBut it is disappointing that government of Nigeria both state and federal could not lift a finger to secure their release. No government show any intention to help. It was we the parents that rallied round to ensure that the students were released.\n\n\u201cWe paid huge amount of money to secure their release, the people collected a number of motorbikes which we have to give because our destiny was tied up.\n\n\u201cThere was no effort, no fight by government or security agencies to get them freed. We suffered, sold all our properties to rescue our children. No government, no security agencies that came to help us. It is shameful that those who did not contribute anything came out to take the glory.\n\n\u201cNow is not a time to take that decision of returning our child back to that school. The school authority tried well. We will take that decision later.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, Mr Chukwuemeka Lawrence, husband to one of the freed staff, said, \u201cwe paid ransom before they were released. After the kidnappers called us and told us that government is behind them, that government knows what they are doing, and that we shouldn\u2019t tell government what we are doing that we should look for more money.\n\n\u201cWe begged them but they refused to listen to our pleas. We sold houses, two people went to pay N10 million each as they were demanding for more money, government who promised that they would help us deserted us.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Specifically, members of the joint committee are in the USA to assess the status and progress of work on the NAF A-29 Super Tucano aircraft. On arrival at EDSI on 27 May 2021, the NASS team led by Senator Michael Nnachi, was briefed on the progress of work on the NAF A-29 Super Tucano programme and the scheduled date of delivery.\n\n\u201cWhile briefing the NASS team, Colonel Authur Ford of the United States Air Force Fighters and Advance Aircraft Directorate stated that 10 out of the 12 aircraft were ready for delivery while 2 were undergoing modification and integration to NAF specific operational configuration\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that the NASS team was assured that the aircraft, which are expected to play critical roles in the fight against insurgency and criminality, would be delivered as planned.\n\nSenator Michael Nnachi commended EDSI for the quality of work on the NAF A-29 Super Tucano.\n\nHe however, queried the long duration of time from the date of full payment to expected date of delivery, which he estimated to be between 3 to 4 years.\n\nIn response, Col. Ford told the team that the long duration was due to the challenges of configuring the aircraft to fit NAF\u2019s required specifications.\n\nThe visiting team which also included Honourables Babajimi Benson, Shehu Koko, Abubakar Maki and Honourable Abass Adigun were received on arrival at Jacksonville, Florida by the Nigerian Defence Attach\u00e9 to the USA, Air Commodore Jibrin Usman, the Lead Foreign Liaison Officer on the A-29, Air Vice Marshal Sule Lawal and senior management staff EDSI.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

There is no doubt that the challenge of delivering COVID-19 vaccines around the region is a colossal one, but we are confident that with the critical steps being taken and with the support of our partners, we would eventually succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his goodwill message at the official opening of the season, the President of the Nigerian Senate, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said that this session is taking place as the sub-region, and indeed, the global community is smarting from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the distraction it caused for humanity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cDespite unfortunate deaths, our response illustrates our resilience in the face of challenges and emergencies. Lessons from the experience are worthy of note and should be useful in our efforts to achieve set goals, and in resolving other trials.\n\nOf primary importance is not only the need to strengthen and grow democracy and its institutions but similarly in ensuring that the advancements we are making is not reversed. We have proved that democracy is representative, inclusive and integrative.\n\n\u201cImplied in these attributes are freedom, rights, happiness and progress. Our nations have showed reasonable commitments to exhibiting these values, and we have a duty as parliamentarians and governments to ensure improved realization of these ideals.\n\nCommon to our illustrious histories is a high regard for the interest of the people, trusting that fulfilment of their quest is a ground for communal and social peace\u201d.\n\nHe also observed that while the ECOWAS protocol on Free Movement of Persons and Goods remains a prized policy, for instance; insecurity, instability, and conflicts are matters requiring continuous attention.",

          "text": "Every Manchester City fan I spoke to outside the ground in Porto after their defeat in the Champions League final asked me the same thing \u2013 \u2018why didn\u2019t he play Fernandinho?\u2019\n\nBut I can see why City boss Pep Guardiola left his captain out, and I can understand why Rodri didn\u2019t start either.\n\nPep has thought \u2018I don\u2019t need a holding midfielder in the centre\u2019 because Chelsea play with two men on the outside in Mason Mount and Kai Havertz behind Timo Werner.\n\nPep thought by going with Ilkay Gundogan in there instead, City could be more creative \u2013 but he must have known it would leave them much more open than usual.\n\nChelsea were clever, of course. Although they kept their defensive shape extremely well, they were not passive about it \u2013 they were trying things as well.\n\nThey knew City wanted to press them high, so they pulled Havertz on to Oleksandr Zinchenko to stop him pushing on to Reece James down their right side. That worked going forward as well as defensively.\n\nHavertz was constantly playing on Zinchenko\u2019s shoulder, but the only time he ran inside him was for Chelsea\u2019s winner, when Ruben Dias was dragged away by Werner and it left that big gap down the middle.\n\nMeanwhile, James just had Raheem Sterling to look after rather than worrying about Zinchenko coming at him too, and he dealt with Sterling brilliantly.\n\nIt was the same on the opposite flank, where Mount pushed on to Kyle Walker and Ben Chilwell kept Riyad Mahrez quiet.\n\nSo, out wide, Chelsea were on top. When City\u2019s wingers got in one-on-one situations, they rarely got past James or Chilwell whether they went inside them or outside.\n\nDown the middle, N\u2019Golo Kante was breaking play up so well too, pinching things and stopping City from building any momentum with their passing.\n\n\u2018Tuchel\u2019s masterclass leaves Guardiola in despair\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re the best team in the world \u2013 Mount\n\nUltimately, City will be disappointed they didn\u2019t move Chelsea around more, but you have to give huge credit to Thomas Tuchel for the way he set Chelsea up.\n\nWith five at the back, and two in front, there was no way through.\n\nKante was meant to be a fitness doubt with a hamstring injury but he absolutely bossed the midfield.\n\nI could tell there was no problem with him when he darted into City\u2019s box to get on the end of a cross in the first few minutes. You don\u2019t make runs like that if you are just trying to get through a game, and he ended up playing an integral role.\n\nCity\u2019s line-up was a bold one, but Kante was one of the reasons they ended up barely registering a shot on target.\n\nOfficially they had one, when Edouard Mendy blocked a Sterling flick early on, but James had already got a foot in and the chance had pretty much gone.\n\nThat was the only time Mendy had to make a save \u2013 apart from that there were a couple of dangerous balls across his box, and a Mahrez shot in stoppage time that flew just over.\n\nThat was it, while Chelsea kept getting behind City, and had plenty of other opportunities before and after their goal.\n\nThe lack of an attacking threat wasn\u2019t the only way this was totally different to the kind of display we have got used to seeing from City this season.\n\nPep changed things around a few games into the campaign and basically said his side were now going to stay tight, and allow fewer counter-attacks against them.\n\nCity focused on keeping the ball and grinding teams down from there, and we have seen countless masterclasses in that from them in the past few months.\n\nThis time, though, it was as if Pep thought he had to go and open the game up, because otherwise Chelsea would have just sat in.\n\nI am sure he understood the risks that went with doing that. I\u2019d be amazed if he didn\u2019t \u2013 but for various reasons, his plan did not work.\n\nHe will get some criticism now about changing a winning style because City lost, and are still waiting for their first Champions League triumph.\n\nBut let\u2019s keep some perspective. City have come a long way, and this was their first Champions League final. It came in a season where they have played twice a week, every week, and have ended up with the Premier League title.\n\nLosing will hurt Pep and his players, as much as it will be an amazing experience for Chelsea. who thoroughly deserved their victory.\n\nBut this has still been a great season for City \u2013 one frustrating night does not change that.\n\n*Michael Brown was speaking to BBC Sport\u2019s Chris Bevan.",
          "summary": "Pep has thought \u2018I don\u2019t need a holding midfielder in the centre\u2019 because Chelsea play with two men on the outside in Mason Mount and Kai Havertz behind Timo Werner.\nDown the middle, N\u2019Golo Kante was breaking play up so well too, pinching things and stopping City from building any momentum with their passing.\nThat was it, while Chelsea kept getting behind City, and had plenty of other opportunities before and after their goal.\nHe will get some criticism now about changing a winning style because City lost, and are still waiting for their first Champions League triumph.\nCity have come a long way, and this was their first Champions League final.",

          "title": "Champions League: Tuchel\u2019s Masterclass Leaves Guardiola in Despair",
          "text": "Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel was at pains to stress this Champions League final was about so much more than his tactical and personal battle with Manchester City\u2019s Pep Guardiola \u2013 and yet the story of this showpiece will have both cast as its central characters.\n\nTuchel, a loser with Paris St-Germain against Bayern Munich in last season\u2019s final, made no mistake with his second chance as he prepared and plotted to perfection to produce a finely tuned, intensely committed Chelsea side fully deserving the victory that saw them crowned champions of Europe for a second time.\n\nIn contrast, Guardiola chose to select a starting 11 he had never picked before in his time as City manager, gambling on an array of attacking talent to compensate for his decision not to use either of his outstanding midfield anchors Fernandinho or Rodri.\n\nIt was a move that left City riddled with confusion, lacking fluency and attacking threat \u2013 in other words it was a selection that deprived the Premier League champions, so outstanding this season, of some of the elements that make them so special.\n\nAs Tuchel celebrated with his family in front of joyous Chelsea fans gathered in Porto\u2019s Estadio Do Dragao, owner Roman Abramovich beamed from the stands at yet another example of how his club turns the game\u2019s normal rules upside down.\n\nIn Chelsea\u2019s world, out of instability comes success. Managerial dismissals bring trophies, as they have done so regularly.\n\nAs it has done with Tuchel winning the Champions League after replacing Frank Lampard in January, and as it did when Roberto Di Matteo replaced Andre Villas-Boas in 2012 and won this tournament for the first time.\n\nChelsea\u2019s fans had warmly embraced their German manager even before kick-off, huge cheers greeting his appearance for pre-match media duties.\n\nAnd in the closing stages Chelsea\u2019s followers responded with deafening noise when Tuchel turned to them and waved his arms demanding more noise to get his players over the line on this night of glory.\n\nChelsea had heroes everywhere, none more so than the magnificent N\u2019Golo Kante, who delivered the complete midfield performance, this game\u2019s great manipulator and controller.\n\nReece James has found himself dragged into the debate about England\u2019s right-back slot for the Euros and the potential exclusion of Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold but he stated his case eloquently, snuffing out the threat of a struggling Raheem Sterling to such an extent that it was no surprise when Manchester City\u2019s forward was substituted.\n\nAnd in match winner Kai Havertz, Chelsea have an elegant, dangerous weapon who is now flourishing after a slow start to his Stamford Bridge career.\n\nMason Mount produced yet another mature masterclass that illustrated why he is a certain midfield starter for England in the forthcoming Euros.\n\nIt is Tuchel, however, who must take the greatest credit for restoring self-belief, confidence and organisation to Chelsea after Lampard\u2019s departure, especially by making the common sense moves of putting the combative, edgy Antonio Rudiger back into the heart of defence and putting Kante in the midfield position where he operates to such world-class game-changing effect.\n\nThe champagne-soaked Tuchel was wearing a smile that looked like it might have to be surgically removed as he celebrated and why not? He suffered the pain of defeat in last season\u2019s Champions League final. Here in Porto, he stood among the litter of blue and silver glitter as a winner, the mastermind of a triumph that writes his name in Chelsea history.\n\nWhat a contrast it was to the despair of Guardiola and Manchester City, who will leave Porto accompanied by bitter disappointment and regrets after a night in which they failed to produce the goods.\n\nGuardiola was hoping to write history of his own, putting his name alongside Liverpool\u2019s Bob Paisley, Carlo Ancelotti at AC Milan and Real Madrid, plus Real Madrid\u2019s Zinedine Zidane, by winning this tournament for a third time.\n\nHe last won it with Barcelona a decade ago and cut a despondent figure as he strolled past the giant silver trophy that remains tantalisingly out of reach for City despite all their spectacular domestic achievements.\n\nOne of Guardiola\u2019s great qualities as a manager is his determination to fashion the beautiful game accompanied by attacking football \u2013 but maybe the in-built instincts got the better of him when he chose a line-up that raised eyebrows as soon as the teamsheets landed.\n\nNo Rodri. No Fernandinho. No protection. Attack-minded players everywhere.\n\nChelsea seized on City\u2019s uncertainty.\n\nMount and Ben Chilwell overran City down the left and, to the naked eye, it appeared that even seasoned, experienced operators such as Kevin de Bruyne \u2013 whose final was cut short by a very heavy illegal hit from Rudiger that left him with a swollen eye \u2013 Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva, seemed uncertain of what their actual roles were.\n\nGuardiola\u2019s strategy was high risk and the outcome suggests it was fatally flawed. He cannot escape scrutiny on his own part in a desperate night for City.\n\nHe is one of the great coaches and managers who has shaped the way modern football is played, influenced so many other coaches, but this was a night when the old questions about over-thinking were asked again.\n\nIt is hard to criticise a manager who has won the Premier League for three of the last four seasons but he tried a line-up he had never used before in arguably the biggest game in City\u2019s history after a season of domestic domination.\n\nRodri and Fernandinho have figured in 60 out of 61 games for City this season, either individually or as a pair. Why change the strategy so radically and use this system in a match of such huge significance?\n\nGuardiola\u2019s plan failed and he will have to accept the criticism that will inevitably come his way.\n\nTuchel has now beaten Guardiola three times since he was appointed in January, in the FA Cup semi-final and in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium.\n\nThis was, by some margin, the sweetest victory of all. This is the victory that means Tuchel has already made an indelible mark at Chelsea despite only being at the club a matter of months.\n\nTuchel has reached The Holy Grail in quickfire time. For Guardiola and Manchester City, the wait goes on. The pain will be acute because they will know they are capable of so much better.\n\nChelsea are the champions of Europe \u2013 a statement that might have been ridiculed on the day Tuchel walked through the doors of Stamford Bridge not so long ago.",

          "text": "Israel was gripped by political drama on Sunday over the possibly imminent end of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s record run as the country\u2019s leader.\n\nAfter four inconclusive parliamentary elections in two years, a 28-day mandate for opposition leader Yair Lapid to form a new government runs out on Wednesday, and media reports said he was close to putting together a coalition that would end Netanyahu\u2019s 12-year stretch as prime minister.\n\nLapid\u2019s chances of success rest largely with far-right politician Naftali Bennett, a kingmaker whose Yamina party has six key seats in parliament.\n\nBennett, 49, was widely expected to announce, possibly as early as Sunday, whether he would team up with Lapid, who leads the Yesh Atid party.\n\nBut first, Bennett would have to rally his own party\u2019s legislators behind joining what Netanyahu\u2019s opponents have described as a government of \u201cchange\u201d comprising factions from the left, centre and right.\n\nStill short of a parliamentary majority after a March 23 election that ended in stalemate, such a diverse grouping could be fragile, and would require outside backing by Arab members of parliament whose political views differ sharply from Yamina\u2019s.\n\nBennett has maintained public silence in recent days, with Likud party chief Netanyahu fuelling speculation his own tenure was about to end in a tweet and video on Friday. \u201cReal Alert,\u201d he wrote, warning that a dangerous \u201cleft-wing\u201d administration was in the cards.\n\nYamina announced late on Saturday that Bennett would meet and update its legislators on Sunday, after reports he had agreed to a deal in which he would serve first as prime minister before handing over to centrist Lapid.\n\nA former defence minister, Bennett has reversed course before over ousting Netanyahu, 71, a right-wing leader in power consecutively since 2009 and now on trial on corruption charges that he denies.\n\nWith an agreement with Lapid widely reported to have been finalised just before fighting erupted on May 10 between Israel and Gaza militants, Bennett said during the hostilities he was abandoning efforts to form a coalition with the centre and left.\n\nBut a ceasefire is holding, a recent wave of street violence in Israel between Arabs and Jews has ebbed, and a Lapid-Bennett partnership could be back on course.\n\nIsraeli political commentators, however, were taking nothing for granted.\n\n\u201cThe anti-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu government of change is still not an accomplished fact,\u201d political columnist Yossi Verter wrote in the left-wing Haaretz newspaper on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s premature to pop open the champagne, and also too early to wear sackcloth,\u201d he said, questioning whether Yamina\u2019s lawmakers could withstand pressure from the right against a deal with Lapid.\n\nIf Lapid, 57, fails to announce a government by Wednesday, a fifth Israeli election since April 2019 \u2013 a prospect Bennett has said he wants to avoid \u2013 is likely.",

Belarusian authorities sent a fighter jet to escort the plane down, before arresting journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen.\n\nBoth are in jail accused of orchestrating mass riots.
