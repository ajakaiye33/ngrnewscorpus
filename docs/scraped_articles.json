          "title": "Controversy surrounds alleged killing of Super TV CEO",
          "text": "Controversy is hovering over what led to the death of the Chief Executive Officer of entertainment channel, Super TV, Mr Usifo Ataga.\n\nOnline reports claimed that an alleged mistress stabbed him to death with multiple wounds found in several parts of his body after they lodged in a place in the Lekki area of Lagos. The sum of N5m was said to have been withdrawn from his bank account and his phones, debit cards and other valuables reportedly missing.\n\nBut some of his close friends who spoke with Sunday PUNCH on Saturday debunked the claims, saying the deceased was murdered and not a philanderer.\n\nOne of the deceased\u2019s friends who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on behalf of the family said he had known Ataga for 25 years.\n\nThe close associate added that the deceased was on the verge of \u201cone of the greatest breakthroughs Nigeria has ever seen\u201d through his media establishment, Super TV, a mobile-enabled platform with two major telecommunication multinationals on board to create affordable subscription rates.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe circumstances under which he was murdered speak of torture. He wasn\u2019t given one blow or shot once and left alone. There are multiple stab wounds on different parts of his body. It appears that someone was trying to get information out of him, and then the final (stab) in his neck was to take his life.\n\n\u201cIs it possible that someone wanted him out of the way? I\u2019m not saying that is what happened. But he was a family man whose life was snuffed out needlessly. He came from a respectable family. Wednesday was his birthday.\n\nAnother friend, Rotimi Albert, whose relationship with Ataga began in 1982 at the Federal Government College, Warri, Delta State, and continued into the University of Benin and beyond, described him as a God-fearing, kind and loving man, who had a positive effect on the lives of everybody he came in contact with.\n\n\u201cThe police are working diligently to solve this case and I am confident the perpetrators will be brought to justice. Then all the facts will be clear to everybody. I am hoping that they can stop all the social media stories and let the police do their work,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said he was going to get back to our correspondents but had yet to do so as of the time of this report.\n\nHowever, a source told Sunday PUNCH that the facility manager of the service apartment where the tragic incident took place had been arrested, adding that efforts were on to arrest the fleeing suspect.\n\nThe source said, \u201cInvestigation is ongoing in Lagos and Abuja, we have the facility manager of the service apartment in our custody and we are interrogating him. The service apartment does not have enough security measures in place that would have prevented such a thing. There was no CCTV camera, if there was a CCTV camera, that would have assisted us in identifying the girl. The management is assisting us and efforts are on to arrest the girl.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, said efforts were on to arrest the fleeing suspect, adding that the victim and the suspect had been lodging in the apartment for now fewer than three days.\n\nHe stated that the victim met the suspect in the apartment, adding on the day of the incident, the victim was scheduled to travel to Abuja to celebrate his birthday with his family.\n\nHe added that the suspect in custody was a tenant who had been using the flat for service apartment, adding that she had been assisting the police investigation.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Some parts of the runway lights at the nation\u2019s flagship airport, the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos has collapsed, forcing British Airways to divert its flight to the Abuja airport on Thursday.\n\nThe development forced the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, the aviation industry regulator, to downgrade the landing procedure at the Lagos airport from Category Two to Category One.\n\nBA passengers whose flight was diverted to the Federal Capital Territory were forced to pass a night in Abuja before being flown back to Lagos on Friday afternoon by the British airline.\n\nThe unserviceable state of the runway lights made it impossible for BA, which flies a large plane, to land at the Lagos airport in the night. Other foreign airlines with relatively smaller planes can land.\n\nIt was learnt that touchdown light at the runway of the international wing of the Lagos airport became bad. As such, bigger planes could not land in the night.\n\nBA was forced to reschedule all its flight out of London to enable it to land at Lagos airport in the afternoon, instead of late evening.\n\nThe Director-General, NCAA, Capt Nuhu Musa, confirmed the development. He said the decision was taken for safety reason.\n\nHe however said that FAAN had fixed the lights but there was a need for the NCAA inspectors to check the lights before an approval could be given for the runway approach lights to be upgraded to Category Two.\n\nNotice to Airmen, a notice to pilots and flying community about flight facilities, seen by our correspondent, showed that the landing approach system at the airport had been downgraded to Cat One.\n\nOther foreign airlines with relatively smaller planes could land. AirFrance and international airlines however landed.\n\nFAAN spokesperson, Mrs Henrieta Yakubu, confirmed the development but also confirmed it had been rectified.\n\nHowever, a new NOTAM has yet to be issued as of the time of filing this report.The NCAA DG said a new NOTAM would not be issued until Monday after the agency\u2019s inspectors would have inspected the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, the development has made BA passengers in London to groan over the situation.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I remain optimistic that humanity shall overcome the pandemic very soon.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year\u2019s International Day of Yoga is \u201cYoga for Wellness\u2019\u2019, which is particularly relevant in the current context.\n\n\u201cYoga has many benefits for the body as well as for the mind. Despite all the efforts and precautions, COVID-19 may infect any person. However, a strong immune system can aid in the fight against it.\n\n\u201dYoga can help build that immunity, for instance, through breathing exercises that strengthen the lungs.\n\n\u201dAt the same time, across the world, millions of people have been forced to stay indoors for months.\n\n\u201dThis has taken a toll on their mental health as well. Regular practice of Yoga can also help them recover.\u201d\n\nAccording to the prime minister, Yoga has an inherent power to connect, saying Yoga is good for community, immunity and unity.\n\nHe observed that the theme of International Day of Yoga celebrations this year reflected the concern for the good health and wellbeing of people across the globe.\n\n\u201dIt is an endeavour to ensure that we focus on fitness as well as wellness.\n\n\u201cI wish to extend through your good offices, my deepest gratitude for the cooperation and efforts extended by one and all in making the International Day of Yoga celebrations a resounding success in your nation every year.\n\n\u201dI am sure that this year will be no different.\n\n\u201cPlease accept my best wishes to you, your family and your citizens, for good health and well-being,\u2019\u2019 he added.

          "text": "For years, the earnings of members of the National Assembly has been an issue of controversy, with reports of them being one of the highest in the world. In this report, DAILY POST looks at the work environment for staff of the National Assembly.\n\nFor civil servants working in the National Assembly, the reality has been very grim. In February, the legislative aides had to shut down the complex with protests for 22 months allowances the management was owing them.\n\nIt took the threat of strike by the workers under the aegis of Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria, (PASAN), National Assembly chapter, for the lawmakers to implement the national minimum wage for the workers.\n\nThe first sign of the grim reality starts from the sight of the shuttles buses. The buses which are in terrible conditions, take people from the Eagle Square junction to the second gate of the National Assembly.\n\nThese buses are in sharp contrast to exotic vehicles the lawmakers ordered for themselves. In 2020, the lawmakers reportedly took delivery of 400 exotic Toyota Camry 2020 model and 14 Toyota Land Cruiser Prado sports utility.\n\nTwitter Ban: Nigerians left to fate, as lawmakers proceed on two weeks holiday\n\n\u201cThey are driving luxurious vehicles, but we the workers are to use these as shuttle. They even increased the price from N30 to N50,\u201d a worker at the National Assembly told DAILY POST.\n\nOur reporter observed that the shuttles only take the passenger to half of the road, while they have to go through extra security checks at the entrance.\n\n\u201cBefore, we used to have these coaster buses run by PASAN for staff. They pick passengers from the junction and take them to the white house. Due to lack of maintenance, the vehicles are not working again,\u201d another staff told DAILY POST.\n\nThe NASS shuttle can only take staff to the second gate, where they are obligated to trek the remaining distance to their offices.\n\nLawmakers in Maitama, Workers in Mararaba, Suleja\n\nFindings also revealed that due to the high cost of rent in the Abuja metropolis, most workers in the National Assembly cannot afford the high cost of rent, hence, most live outside FCT, some in Suleja in Niger State and Mararaba in Nassarawa State.\n\nFor most workers in Mararaba axis, traffic congestion is another major source of worry.\n\nFor senators who get N4.02 million annually as housing allowance, the prime locations are the options for them. Maitama, Guzape, Asokoro, Katampe are their options. Their colleagues in the lower chamber also earn N3.9 million annually for accommodation. These figures are according to the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission.\n\nThese lawmakers also get 6.0 million and 5.9 million once in 4 years as Senators and Reps respectively for furniture. Aside from these, the lawmakers also get the controversial cost of running office which is about N13.5 million per month for Senators and N11.5 million per month for Reps members.\n\nFor some of these workers, getting accommodation within the city on civil servants salary is highly impossible considering rents in the city. To cushion the effect of travelling, the management of the National Assembly provided PASAN with some vehicles to take staff to some selected locations like Mararaba, Masaka, and Keffi, all in Nasarawa State. Others are Karu, Lugbe, Karishi and Suleja.\n\nMost workers residing in Mararaba axis often have to delay going home till late in the evening to avoid the traffic congestion, while also leaving as early as 5: 30 am to beat the traffic in the morning.\n\nAccording to a Physiotherapist, Rahmat Ibraheem, traffic has an impact on productivity for workers.\n\n\u201cStaying in traffic for a long period leads to production of the stress hormone, which can make you less relaxed when you get to work or at home at night. The sitting position in some of our public vehicles is another issue, due to the number of passengers they carry at a go. The implication is that this leads to muscle wastage and stiffness.\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that the \u201cbody must be in synergy to be effective, and when stress hormones are produced.\u201d\n\nFor most workers, muscle wellbeing may be a luxury considering that inflation on the prices of food items continues to grow.\n\nDAILY POST observes that while the workers struggle daily with the challenges of transportation and others, lawmakers go about with exotic cars.\n\nKogi: Police debunk reported kidnap of luxurious bus passengers by bandits",

          "title": "Truth, dialogue and reconciliation as panacea to Nigeria\u2019s many problems",
          "text": "By Femi Orebe\n\nIn spite of my recent criticisms of the government of President Muhammadu Buhari \u2013 recent because I used to be one of his well-known supporters (remember I wrote in 2015 that Nigeria needs him more than he needs Nigeria), I have concluded at least five of my last eight articles with prayers, wishing him God\u2019s guidance in his arduous state duties.\n\nI keep praying for him because I have, personally, not lost faith in Nigeria. Indeed, I believe that this country can survive its present challenges and emerge a much more united and prosperous country. What we presently lack is leadership; one that will know neither Jew nor Gentile, but would rule with the mindset that East, West, or North, Nigeria is one; a united country, under God. I also believe that we can still see president Buhari experience a Pauline conversion.\n\nAfter all, this is the same man Nigerians ensured his election both in 2015 and \u201819 after three unsuccessful attempts. We obviously did not forget how vigorously he had always championed Northern causes as in when he equated attack on Boko Haram with an attack on the North or how the same philistines named him one of their representatives in an anticipated dialogue with the President Goodluck Jonathan government. Rather, for those of us who aggressively canvassed his candidacy during those two election cycles, as well as the Nigerians who massively voted him, especially those from the South, the following reasons adduced recently by Dele Momodu, the Ovation publisher for supporting him would hold good for all of us:\n\n\u201cOne. We were tired of PDP after 16 years of profligacy and all kinds of bad behaviour that seemed to make General Abacha begin to look like a Saint. Two. In the days of tribulations, you sometimes run to the elders of the family in order to tap into their uncommon experience and wisdom notwithstanding their shortcomings. We perceived Buhari to be such an elder. Three. We reasoned that whatever is lacking in the President would be covered by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo who is recognised not only as a cerebral and knowledgeable man, but also an outstanding and accomplished administrator, given his stint at the helm of affairs of the Ministry of Justice in Lagos State. Four. We expected the President to cooperate beautifully with some of the bright people in his Party, who know their onions and can guide him in the right direction. Five. We never thought in our wildest imagination that any leadership, no matter its background, would ever have the temerity and audacity to lead us back to the dark days of the military. Six. We expected the President to have accepted the reality that the world has changed so drastically since he was forced out of power in 1985 and it is virtually impossible to continue to run government in analogue fashion\u201d.\n\nMore than these, however, Buhari\u2019s incandescent personal integrity was enough for me. Here was a man, a general of the Nigerian army, many of whose colleagues were corrupt to their teeth, who has held very high public offices, including that of military Head of state but had not been accused of corruption and who, in addition, lives a completely ascetic life, and I needed no further persuasion that this was the person to lift Nigeria out of the moral depravity, the deep dungeon, into which 16 years of a thieving PDP had thrown it. I could not, in my life, have imagined what we came to see of President Buhari as elected president of the most populous Black nation on earth. I never could have imagined President Buhari as an ethnic champion, with his government\u2019s key policies, sans its infrastructural development policy, being solely targeted at benefitting his ethnic group, the Fulani \u2013 RUGA, WATER BILL, and now, his intending to exhume from the dead, an antediluvian GRAZING ROUTES, even when he should know that the federal government cannot legally exercise authority over an inch of state land, without the state governor\u2019s permission, or without being hauled before the courts by the original land owners.\n\nAs a commentator on one of my recent articles recently put it, President Buhari did much more to disappoint Nigerians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCommented Joshua Oyewande on my article: \u201cPresident Buhari As I Have Never Seen Him \u2026\u201d of 13 June, 2021: \u201cBuhari has disappointed himself. Buhari has disappointed Nigerians. Buhari has disappointed humanity. For Buhari to tell Nigerians and the world that the Fulanis carrying AK47 and other sophisticated weapons used in killing, maiming and raping of farmers, innocent women, children working on their farmlands in Yorubaland, Iboland, in the South South, even in some parts of the North, are Fulanis from Mauritania, Mali, Chad, Senegal, is not only an indictment of himself but also that of his government. Human rights lawyers should get ready to prepare charges for war crimes against him at the ICJ in The Hague\u201d. \u201c \u2026 Buhari should not shift any blame on any governor. State governors are not in charge of Customs and Immigration\u201d.\n\nMany Nigerians, not just Oyewande feel that aggrieved.\n\nBut what do we need a Nigerian President being hauled before the world court for? Won\u2019t that tarnish, rather than enhance Nigeria or should a whole country be going, heedlessly, after one man? Even though as late as during his recent interviews, President Buhari was still avuncular, defending all these, and feeling sorry about nothing, I believe we would be better served salvaging our country, rather than pursuing a chimera.\n\nAnd here exactly is where Truth, Dialogue and Reconciliation come in.\n\nContrary to the views of many, Nigeria is not a mistake. What it has lacked, like forever, is sincere leadership, the type that reminds one of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, even though out of religious bigotry, Turkey\u2019s current rabid President, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00f0an, has completely obliterated Ataturk\u2019s historic contributions to that country.\n\nThe bitterness in South Africa was probably nowhere near what currently obtains in Nigeria when they set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission at the end of the Apartheid regime. The present, federally instigated iniquities in Nigeria are such that nobody with his/her head in the right place can suggest such for Nigeria at this moment. Rather, we must consciously, and honestly, begin the process of righting the many wrongs tearing our country apart. And that can only start with President Buhari who many Nigerians hold responsible for the calamitous state of our country today.\n\nWhoever has been reading this column will remember that I have always emphasised the necessity for telling ourselves the truth. This was mostly in relation to those around the President who, probably out of fear or intimidation, or the Fulani culture of respect, and never controverting the elder \u2013 (Fulanis predominate the presidency), have not been telling the president the truth either of the daily butchery of human beings in all parts of the country, or the unbelievable incidences of kidnapping of students, even mere pupils, especially in the North and perpetrated mostly by Fulanis, native and foreign, as His Eminence, the Sultan recently honestly confirmed; the ballooning prices of foodstuff which is turning millions of Nigerians into destitudes \u2013 reminds one of the late Dikko who said Nigerians would eat from the dustbin \u2013 or the embarrassing, daily devaluation of the naira which is now, surprisingly hovering well over 500 to the dollar, even as the borrowings from China to build railways into the president\u2019s \u201c cousin\u2019s\u201d \u2013 his own words \u2013 Niger Republic continues, unabated.\n\nAs if to bail me out of my inability to brilliantly craft the situation in the presidency, this is how Dr Tunde Oluwajuyitan of The Nation reflected it in his article: \u2018A President Trapped In Age Of Feudal Lords\u2019 \u2013 Thursday, 17 June, 2021:\u201dPresident Buhari remains stranded in the age of feudalism where the lords value honour and loyalty of their serfs who must be bound by oath of allegiance. It is not an accident (therefore), that most of his loyal gatekeepers are unable to tell him the truth\u201d.\n\nStill talking truth, President Buhari must also show that he knows the truth about the bestiality of marauding Fulani herdsmen just as I indicated above that His Eminence, the Sultan did, affirming that 8 out of 10 kidnappers in Nigeria are Fulanis. There is nothing shameful about saying the truth if the president is keen about healing the country.\n\nThe same appeal goes to Governor Umahi and his other colleagues in the Southeast who, together with the Igbo elite, rather than honestly name IPOB and the ESN as the terrorists killing security personnel and burning government properties in that part of the country , are mouthing inanities like \u2018unknown gun men\u2019 and \u2018it is not in the Igbo culture to burn things\u2019. If that is true why are they now shouting about government\u2019s determination to run these \u2018unknowns\u2019 aground. How long ago was it that the same Kanu, the IPOB leader, got Lagos literally burnt down, without a single word of remonstration from the East \u2013 the reason it is said that what goes round, comes round.\n\nUnfortunately, their timidity, taciturnity and fear of IPOB, have all led the president into equating all Igbos with IPOB as in when, during one of his recent interviews, he alluded to IPOB, saying they are all over the country, and have properties scattered all over. That, of course, was very unbecoming of the President as it illustrates nothing but bitterness against a major ethnic group in the country while he more than romances his own. It will be wishful thinking for Igbos, or anybody for that matter, however, to think that government can look askance while all that mayhem is happening in the Southeast and the Southsouth.\n\nWhile at this too, and still in the process of righting wrongs, President Buhari must now admit that it is unstatesmanlike, putting the headship of nearly all major agencies of government, in his administration, in the hands of Northerners.\n\nJudging from his appointments, I often wonder if, out of 20 appointments to be made, he would not really wish he could allot 22 to the North. And, without specific constitutional provisions, I doubt if any Igbo would be in President Buhari\u2019s Executive council. This is absolutely iniquitous, and it is time the President changes his attitude to Igbos. If it came from the war years, a half century plus should be more than enough to cure the president of that beef; all in the name of healing our country.\n\nAs the Nigerian Army, speaking through its spokesperson, Brig- General Onyema Nwachukwu, said only this past week, \u201cgun alone cannot stop the prevailing security threat across the land\u201d.\n\nOnly equity and fair mindedness, can.\n\nThis is why the President should now nurture that spirit that led him to, a few weeks ago, send the Magashi \u2013 led delegation to jaw jaw with leaders of the Southeast during which they discussed issues of marginalisation, herders/ farmers problems etc which sa the Southeast leaders rejecting secession. This is the way to go and president Buhari should now intensify this healthy interaction rather than hold on to agelong prejudices simply because the youth of that region are, albeit in a wrong manner, reacting to their people being treated like orphans in their own country.\n\nAfter all these have been done, only one thing would remain, and it is this: that the President disavows of the Miyetti Allah nauseating claim that Nigeria is the captured territory of the Fulani. They should be told, in unmistakable terms, that this is a historical fallacy as Fulanis never captured the Kanuris, the Yorubas or any ethnic group in Southern Nigeria. Should they require any education in that respect, the Yorubas beat Fulanis back, with their tail behind their legs, at the Oshogbo battle of 1840 when the following Ilorin war chiefs were captured: Jimba, head slave of the Emir and one of the sons of Ali, the Fulani commander-in-chief. Also captured were Chief Lateju, and Ajikobo, the Yoruba Balogun of Ilorin, both of who, being Yoruba by birth, were executed as traitors.\n\nIf President Buhari chooses Nigeria, by disavowing of that annoying claim, in addition to the earlier steps suggested, the stage would have been set for true dialogue between, and reconciliation, of all ethnic groups in Nigeria.\n\nMay the good Lord guide the President as he sets about healing the land.",

          "title": "Igboland isn\u2019t a dot, it\u2019s not landlocked",
          "text": "By Aloy Ejimakor\n\nIT\u2019S often said that a lie told so many times, if unchallenged, may \u2013 in course of time \u2013 begin to pass for the truth. One of such is the terrible lie, institutionally purveyed since the end of the civil war, to the effect that Igboland is landlocked or has no access to the sea. Just recently, President Muhammadu Buhari not only implied the same but he went further to derisively describe Igboland as a \u201cdot in a circle\u201d, using IPOB as a metaphor.\n\nThe purpose of this essay, therefore, is to debunk this lie with some simple historical and topographical evidence that are even in plain view, if you care to dig or do some basic physical explorations of your own.\n\nSuffice it to say that it is a profound tragedy that entire generations of the immediate post-war Igbos never bordered to check but seemingly accepted this brazen institutional falsehood, largely intended to taunt the Igbo and put them down. A few that knew it to be false just didn\u2019t care anymore.\n\nAnd that History was constructively banned since the end of the Civil War made it worse, plus the fact that most people don\u2019t take physical Geography (or even adventure) that serious anymore, otherwise they would have discovered that Abia, Imo and Anambra States have varying short-distance paths to the Atlantic through Imo, Azumiri and Niger Rivers.\n\nIt\u2019s not really rocket science, as you can easily confirm this if you know how to read (or plot) Google Earth; or you conquer your fear of swamp snakes and walk through these areas on foot.\n\nThere are also many other hardly explored waterways and slithering tributaries, including the remote reaches of Oguta Lake and Urashi River at Oseakwa (Ihiala) that meandered through Igbo-delta wetlands to the Southeastern ends of the Atlantic waterfront.\n\nThese rivers have varying lengths of short navigational paths to the Atlantic, and in some cases, are far shorter nautically (and even on footpath) than the Port Harcourt, Calabar and Ibaka seaports are to their side of the Atlantic.\n\nMany of these pathways, including particularly the ones from the outer reaches of Imo and Azumiri Rivers terminate at the Atlantic at no more than 15 to 30 Nautical miles to the beachhead. To put it in lay language, one nautical mile equals 1.8 kilometers.\n\nThus, the contiguity of Southeast (not even the greater Igboland) to the Atlantic is nautically less than the Atlantic is to the seaports in Calabar, Onne, Ibaka, Lagos and Portharcourt. If you discount the territories unfairly excised from Igboland during State creations and the damnable boundary adjustments, it will be far less.\n\nTo be sure, Ikwerre land or Igweocha which bears the greater portions of the Portharcourt seaport was dredged up to 50 miles to the Atlantic front through the Bonny River. Onne seaport was dredged up to 60 miles to the Atlantic and Calabar seaport was dredged some 45 nautical miles to the Atlantic. Ibaka seaport is about 30 nautical miles to the Atlantic and the Lagos seaports dredged up to about 50 nautical miles to the Atlantic.\n\nCompare all these to Obuaku in Abia State, which is only 25 nautical miles to the Atlantic from the confluence of Imo and Azumiri Rivers, of which Azumiri, on its separate merits, lies not more than 30 nautical miles to the Atlantic beachfront. The less obvious one is the little-known Oseakwa (Urashi) in Ihiala (Anambra State) which is mere 18 nauticals to the Atlantic, all with its 65 feet of natural depth, unarguably comparable to no other River in Nigeria.\n\nAdditionally, what is geopolitically known as Igboland today is far smaller than what it was and legally supposed to be. As far back as 1856, Baikie \u2013 one of the earliest and credible Geographers of ancient Nigeria, had this to say \u2013 \u201cIgbo homeland, extends east and west, from the Old Kalabar river to the banks of the Kwora, Niger River, and possesses also some territory at Aboh, an Igbo clan, to the west-ward of the latter stream. On the north it borders on Igara, Igala and A\u2019kpoto, and it is separated from the sea only by petty tribes, all of which trace their origin to this great race\u201d (Baikie, William Balfour, published with a sanction of Her Majesty\u2019s Government in 1856).\n\nBut with that infamous post-War abandoned property policy and the egregious institutional injustices in boundary adjustments, coupled with the widespread anti-Igbo gerrymandering, Igbos physically and psychologically lost political hold of their vested ancestral lands, all to the point of not caring anymore about their historical contiguity to the Atlantic, which their ancestors beheld and called \u2018Oshimiri\u2019 \u2013 The Great Sea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe psychological beat-down and gang-up got so bad and institutional that some of the descendants of these Igbo ancestors (nearest to the Atlantic and now lying outside Southeast) are no longer sure whether they are Igbo or not.\n\nThe worst injustice was in 1976 when the Justice Nasir Boundary Adjustment Commission made a serious and targeted agenda of carving out core Igboland territories into some neighboring States of the South-South. But they didn\u2019t quite make an absolute success of it. They missed the southernmost Southeast lands that possess Rivers that meandered through slices of Igbo-friendly South-South territories and ended up at the Atlantic, thus unwittingly (and luckily) placing Igboland and its right of access to the sea under the canons and realms of customary international law.\n\nAs it stands, international law of the sea guarantees Igboland (whether it remains Nigerian territory or not) unhindered access to the nearest sea (in this case: the Atlantic) peacefully through any of the various short-distance rivers, waterways and tributaries that originated from Igboland but ultimately washed into the Atlantic through contiguous South-south territories.\n\nFor avoidance of doubt, there\u2019s particularly the Obuaku confluence in Ukwa West (Abia State) that flows through greater Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom State before expanding out and washing into the near-reaches of the Atlantic. And the River Niger which ultimately joined the Atlantic through a vast network of hardly explored creeks and mangrove swamps that abut the Bight of Biafra (officially corrupted to Bight of Bonny, after the War).\n\nNigeria is subject to the International Law of the Sea and is therefore bound to abide by its provisions, should the need arise in a scenario of persistent sovereign oppression of the Igbo as an identifiable (and protected) indigenous group within Nigeria. The others are the United Nations Treaty of the Sea and the African Union Treaties and Conventions on the Sea, including particularly the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights, which Nigeria ratified and domesticated in 1983.\n\nThe pertinent provisions are mostly embedded in the copious protections relating to the collective economic and commercial rights of indigenous peoples lying within a Treaty nation. Ndigbo are undoubtedly an indigenous people presently lying within Nigeria.\n\nSo, international law will surely come into play should a belligerent or legal conflict arise out of Nigeria\u2019s oppressive institutional resistance to granting a seaport to Igboland \u2013 an issue so fundamental and compelling that it bears the fulcrum of what is agitating the Igbo to the point of seeking an alternative to Nigeria.",

          "title": "N288b COVID-19 Relief Fund: How govt, MDAs scammed us, by SME owners",
          "text": "With the Federal Government claiming to have disbursed N288billion COVID-19 relief fund to alleviate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on vulnerable Nigerians, TAIWO ALIMI fact-checks the claims against available data and facts.\n\nSMEs shortchanged during disbursement as politicians hijack palliatives\n\nMore than 100 million Nigerians sink into poverty \u2013 NBS/World Bank\n\nFolashade Adejobi owns a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) running a catering service in Lagos state. Her business, however, suffered badly during the lockdown triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. All the companies she serviced shut down, except one.\n\nThe only one that weathered the COVID-19 contraction subsequently downsized. This affected her business negatively. Her income got depleted by half and she began to feed on her little savings in the bank. In a short while, all her reserves were gone.\n\nCash-strapped, Adejobi needed help and in late 2020, her sister introduced her to the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN)\u2019s COVID-19 Supporting Small Business/MSME Survival Fund supervised by the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment and she applied for the fund. She got a form, filled it and submitted.\n\nAfter waiting for more than three months, she received a text message from a government agency in April 2021 that her application had been granted and she would be paid N30,000 monthly as SME support for three months. Her happiness knew no bounds. \u201cI felt happy because the support is coming at the right time. Things are too expensive in the market and it is eating into my profit,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 45- year- old\u2019s optimism, however, dwindled when the money finally arrived. \u201cMy sister called me prior to disbursement that a condition is attached to payment: I would have to refund N15, 000.00 (half of the payment),\u201d she said.\n\nShe could not comprehend it at first but her sister insisted on the \u2018settlement\u2019 for government officials. \u201cIn late April, N30, 000 was transferred to my First Bank Plc account and my sister called that she had been reliably informed of the payment that same day. She demanded the \u2018settlement\u2019 from the agreed sum paid into her account.\u201d\n\nUnfazed, Adejobi refused to pay up for three days. She, however, succumbed on the fourth day following incessant harassment by phone calls.\n\nThinking that was the end of the drama, within three days of the first installment, she woke up to see another alert of N30, 000 and almost immediately her sister called her again to request the usual payback.\n\nAt first, she lied about receiving the money but her sister persisted until she succumbed and sent the \u2018settlement.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat is glaring to me is that the government officials are working hand in hand with my sister and banker. They knew the moment I got the money and they won\u2019t allow me rest until I returned half of it.\u201d\n\nAnother question agitated her mind. \u201cI was supposed to get the money within three months, that is, N30,000 monthly but to my surprise, the full N90, 000 for the three installments was paid within 10 days.\u201d\n\nShe reckoned that the system is either fraudulent or is being manipulated by fraudulent officials and their collaborators.\n\nA culture of \u2018settlement\u2019\n\nAdejobi\u2019s story is hardly different from that of Taju Ibrahim, an artisan living in Ogun State, businessman Lanre Osifeso from Akure in Ondo State and housewife, Felicia Wogu, who resides in Magboro, Ogun State.\n\nIbrahim received the first installment of the COVID-19 Survival Fund of N30, 000 in March, this year, through the help of a friend who introduced him to the scheme. He said, \u201cI received the money on March 8, 2021, and my friend called me to payback N15, 000.00 into his account two days later. I had spent the money before he asked for payment, so, I could not pay up.\u201d\n\nThe bricklayer said he received no payment afterwards even though he was told that he would receive N90, 000 in three installments.\n\nOsifeso has been paid twice and he paid N20, 000 from the money for \u2018settlement.\u2019\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m expecting the final payment as I speak with you. My cousin introduced me to it and I\u2019ve been paying back through him. There is no way to trace the money back to the ministry officials.\u201d\n\nIn Wogu\u2019s case, the payment was facilitated by her husband whose friend introduced to the scam. So far, she has received N30, 000 and paid back N15, 000. She said, \u201cThere are many people and government officials involved in this scam and that is why it is going on unabated.\u201d\n\nWogu said she would continue to play along in order to receive the outstanding payments.\n\nFurther investigation by The Nation revealed that the COVID-19 Survival Fund disbursements are fraught by fraud often perpetrated by corrupt government officials and their collaborators.\n\nShady claims\n\nOn September 24, 2020, during a press conference in Abuja to update Nigerians on the progress of the National MSME Survival Fund and the Guaranteed Off-Take Stimulus Schemes programme of the FG, the Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mariam Yalwaji Katagum, said the \u201cPayroll Support Scheme targets 500,000 individual beneficiaries. The scheme will support MSME payroll obligations by paying between N50, 000 (max) and N30, 000 (min) to between three minimum and 10 maximum staff for three months.\u201d\n\nOn April 22, 2021, Clem Agba, the Minister of State, Ministry of Budget and National Planning, while giving a comprehensive breakdown of the COVID-19 expenditure said: \u201cFrom the N500 Billion stimulus in the revised 2020 budget, a provision of N126 Billion was made for building a resilient health system in Nigeria to prevent the loss of life.\u201d\n\nHowever, Vahyala Kwaga, a Senior Policy Analyst with the NGO, BudgIT, countered the claim. He said, \u201cUnfortunately, there are several portals by which information is been disseminated, and to a very large extent, this creates an overlap of information and creates further difficulties in verification. So, you have the open treasury portal, corpus portal, and the bureau of public procurement as well. The important thing is triangulating these data to make sure that they all tally but because a lot of it is in non machine readable format, it makes analysis very difficult. Some of the information is missing and the links dead. So, you can\u2019t in good faith say these figures are verifiable because there is no way for you to confirm them.\u201d\n\nHe also punctured Agba\u2019s declaration that, \u201cEach state received N1billion except for Lagos and Kano states that received higher amounts.\u201d\n\nKwaga argued that while it is a reasonable assessment, it would have been nice if there was a provision of only one viable portal in which COVID-19 spending, expenditure, donations can be tracked. \u201cAlso, several states have not published their information. Again, some states have provided links but they links are dead. Out of 36 states I would say seven have provided some form of pointers towards information and some of them are not even accessible to analyst and journalists,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response to Agba\u2019s claim that, \u201cThe president directed the disbursement of COVID-19 cash transfer to additional one million households as part of the social intervention programmes to protect the vulnerable,\u201d Kwaga said: \u201cThe idea is to trace how much has been given out and who has received them. It is worrisome that the FG claimed to have spent a lot but they are unable to show us just who have received this relief materials. There is a break in the transparency line and it makes tracking extremely difficult.\u201d\n\nOn FG\u2019s claim that it had spent \u201cN60 billion on road construction and rehabilitation under the Moving People and Goods programme across the country,\u201d Kwaga noted: \u201cIt is not clear here if the N60 billion are fresh allocations or are they moving the funds from the existing budgetary allocation for road constructions? You could call this an extra budgetary allocation but it still need to follow the prescribed pattern of transparency, accountability and openness.\n\n\u201cI would say the FG really needs to do better in terms of implementation, measurement, and providing ample trusted third party verification for these things. Yes, they have said there is a lot of money available, Nigerians do not really know how much of these monies have been disbursed and genuinely whether or not there is a change in the economy as a result of this injection.\u201d\n\nOn June 12 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari, during his nationwide address to mark Nigeria Democracy Day said: \u201cDuring the pandemic, we disbursed N5, 000 to one million Nigerians using a Rapid Response Register and advanced N20, 000 to 750,000 beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Progamme and provided 1.37 million Nigerians with palliatives from CACOVID.\n\n\u201cAt the same time the Federal Government released 109,000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70,000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation.\n\nPresident Buhari concluded thus: \u201cIn the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\u201d\n\nReality vs FGN\n\nGoing by available data, the Federal Government\u2019s claims conflict with the realities on ground. Verifiable figures obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) punctured government\u2019s sustainability claims.\n\nGovernment\u2019s claims that hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been created through its COVID-19 relief fund and from billions of Naira pumped into the economy to galvanise it, are hardly felt by the people.\n\nFGN declaration that it has sustained 700,000 jobs in 140,000 MSMEs and 1,500 self-employed individuals through grants, and recruited 1,000 persons per local government of the 36 states and the FCT resulting in 774,000 persons being employed, fell short when it was compared to current unemployment figures as summarised by the NBS.\n\nThe unemployment figure released by NBS in fourth quarter of 2020 also contradicts FG\u2019s claim on new employment.\n\n\u201cDuring the reference period, the computed national unemployment rate rose from 27.1% in Q2, 2020 to 33.3% in Q4, 2020, while the underemployment rate decreased from 28.6% to 22.8%. A combination of both the unemployment and underemployment rate for the reference period gave a figure of 56.1%. This means that 33.3% of the labour force in Nigeria or 23,187,389 persons either did nothing or worked for less than 20 hours a week, making them unemployed by our definition in Nigeria. This is an additional 1,422,772 persons from the number in that category in Q2, 2020. Using the international definition of unemployment, the rate was computed to be 17.5%.\u201d\n\nWhile the FG is claiming creation of new jobs, the reality is that more Nigerians have lost their jobs.\n\nThe situation is worse in rural areas where government claimed to have spent over N12billion on employment generation and facilities for rural dwellers; NBS estimates reveal that, \u201cThe unemployment rate among rural dwellers was 34.5%, up from 28.2% in Q2, 2020, while urban dwellers reported a rate of 31.3% up from 26.4%. In the case of underemployment among rural dwellers, it declined to 26.9% from 31.5%, while the rate among urban dwellers decreased to 16.2% from 23.2% in Q2, 2020.\u201d\n\nAmong the young people (15-34 years) the story is devastating. \u201cFor the period under review, Q4, 2020, the unemployment rate among young people (15-34years) was 42.5% up from 34.9%, while the rate of underemployment for the same age group declined to 21.0% from 28.2% in Q2, 2020. These rates were the highest when compared to other age groupings.\u201d\n\nThe summary is that many young Nigerians lost lucrative jobs and resorted to less paying jobs to make ends meet.\n\nSola Ogunwale, a chartered accountant, who was caught in the web of unemployment after his company went under in 2020, painted a pathetic image. He said, \u201cWhat the NBS figures are saying is that more educated young Nigerians now ride \u2018Okada\u2019 (Commercial motorcycles), \u2018Keke Marwa\u2019 (commercial tricycle) and do other menial jobs.\u201d\n\nThe story is the same across state boundaries as NBS estimates reveal a project a bleak picture across the nooks and crannies of the country.\n\n\u201cIn the case of unemployment by state, Imo state recorded the highest rate of unemployment with 56.64%. This was followed by Adamawa state with 54.89% and Cross Rivers state with 53.65%. The states with the lowest rates were Osun, Benue and Zamfara states with 11.65%, 11.98% and 12.99% respectively.\n\nIn the case of underemployment, Benue state recorded the highest rate with 43.52%, followed by Zamfara and Jigawa States with 41.73% and 41.29% respectively. Lagos state recorded the lowest underemployment rate, with 4.5% in Q4, 2020.\n\n\u201cA total number of 12,160,178 did not do any work in the last seven days preceding the survey,\u201d stated the NBS.\n\nPalliatives hijacked by politicians\n\nInvestigation carried out in five states most hit by the pandemic namely Lagos, Kano, Rivers, Ogun and Niger states showed that a great number of vulnerable people including women, children, the elderly and physically challenged, did not get palliatives provided by the government. Rather, politicians, community leaders and their cohorts got it.\n\nBudgIT independent findings reads in part: \u201cDuring the homegrown school feeding tracking in Lagos, we visited different distribution centres in Ikeja, Surulere, Yaba, Ketu and Mushin. According to our findings, the exercise was a lot more transparent in Lagos. Security operatives were deployed to provide safety for the distribution agents and also help in handling the process. We also observed that the packages arrived at the centres on time, and most of the beneficiaries got their take-home rations without any significant scuffle.\n\n\u201cAt the Maryland school complex in Lagos State, the tracking team confirmed that officials followed the due process to a considerable extent as beneficiaries used the QR coded vouchers to access their take-home rations. Citizens were allowed to pick up their rations once they presented the coupon. The take-home rations were valued at N4, 200 according to current market price and made up of 5 kg bag of rice, 5 kg bag of beans, 500 ml vegetable oil, 750 ml palm oil, 500 mg salt, 15 pcs of eggs, 140gm tomato paste.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLukman Olanrewaju, a social worker in Agaye 1 CDA, Ojo Local government area, reported that \u201ca measly five sachets of noodles and bowl of beans were shared to each landlord association in a community to cushion the stay-at-home effects.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn most monitored local government areas, including Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Sururlere and Epe, we discovered that palliatives were hijacked and diverted by politicians and shared among party members. Some residents who are not members of the party lamented the hijack and their exclusion from the whole distribution process. Ward chairman is in charge of the distribution of the food in the Agege area in Lagos State. One cup of rice, one cup of beans and one sachet of tomato paste were given to a street with more than 30 houses,\u201d Olanrewaju added.\n\nOga Yemi in Iseyin Street, Onipanu-Lagos state said: \u201cThe politicians in our area hijacked the sharing of the palliatives, which was channeled through the party\u2019s leadership across the wards in the local government area.\u201d\n\nCorroborating him, another Lagos resident, Funke, in Surulere, stated: \u201cWe received two cups of rice and three sachets of noodles and salt. My family consists of four members so the palliative was not enough to cater to our needs\u201d\n\nIn Rivers State, a resident of the Rumualogu community revealed that the only relief packages several people in the community got during the lockdown came from generous individuals who wanted to assist the less privileged.\n\nAnd Amina from Dogowa LGA, Kano State shared similar catalogue of complain: \u201cOur community only received three bags of Rice, one bag of beans and groundnut oil for over three hundred residents. Each household was given four cups of rice, beans and one sachet of groundnut oil. Not every household benefited from the palliative items\u201d\n\nImpact on Nigerians\n\nThe result is that the target beneficiaries are not feeling the impact of the N288 Billion COVID-19 intervention fund even as more people slip below the poverty line.\n\nAccording to World Bank\u2019s bankrolled National Longitudinal Phone Survey (NLPS), being implemented by NBS monthly, more Nigerians will sink below the poverty index due to the economic impact of COVID-19\n\n\u201cThe number of poor people would be set to rise from 82.9 million in 2019 to 90.0 million by 2022 due to natural population growth, yet with the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis, the national poverty rate is instead forecast to jump to from 40.1% in 2019 to 45.2% in 2022, implying that 100.9 million Nigerians will be living poverty by 2022,\u201d stated the report.\n\nThis contradicts President Buhari\u2019s claim that: \u2018In the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\u201d\n\nHouseholds income remain precarious sinking lower than last year and leaving more families financially insecure.\n\nInflation skyrockets\n\nThe situation is complicated by the soaring inflation index. The NBS recorded The CPI (Consumer Price index), which measures inflation increasing by 18.17% YoY in March 2021, 0.82% higher than February 2021.\n\nNBS\u2019 \u2018Selected food price watch data\u2019 for April 2021 reflected that the average price of one dozen of medium sized eggs increased annually by 11.26% and monthly by 1.13% to N530 in April 2021, from N524.47 in March 2021.\n\nThe average price of 1kg of imported rice increased annually by 14.57% and decreased monthly by -0.67% to N540.58 in April 2021 from N544.21 in March 2021, while the average price of 1kg of tomato increased annually by 0.09% and monthly by 3.67% to N277.26 in April 2021, from N267.45 in March 2021.\n\nSimilarly, the average price of 1kg of yam tuber increased annually by 9.87% and monthly by 3.26% to N252.80 in April 2021, from N244.82 in March 2021.\n\nTransport fare has also increased through the inflation. The NBS Transport fare Watch report for April 2021 covering road journeys and water way passenger transport, showed a rapid fare increase on every mode of transportation.\n\nAn average fare paid by commuters for bus journey within the city increased by 2.34% monthly and by 72.59% yearly to N386.10 in April 2021, from N377.27 in March 2021. States with the highest bus journey fare within the city were Zamfara (N620.35), Bauchi (N600.35) and Nasarawa (N500.23), while states with lowest bus journey fare rate within the city were Oyo (N200.07), Abia (N215.04) and Borno (N263.45).\n\nFor bus journey intercity, it increased by 1.48% monthly and by 37.50% annually to N2,446.86 in April 2021 from N2,411.29 in March 2021. States with the highest bus journey fare intercity were Abuja FCT (N4,594.21), Lagos (N3,500.20) and Sokoto (N3,340.30) while States with lowest bus journey fare within city were Bayelsa (N1,764.55), Bauchi (N1,782.12) and Enugu (N1,800.40). The average fare paid by commuters for journey by motorcycle per drop increased by 1.79% month-on-month and by 86.41% year-on-year to N276.30 in April 2021 from N271.44 in March 2021. States with the highest journey fare by motorcycle per drop were Yobe (N455.02), Lagos (N435.21) and Taraba (N430.55) while states with lowest journey fare by motorcycle per drop were Adamawa (N95.10), Katsina (N155.04) and Niger (N160.20).\n\n\u2018Govt must do more\u2019\n\nThe economic effect of COVID-19 pandemic is biting harder leading to loss of livelihood and abysmal increase in food, transportation, and housing and in general standard of living.\n\nOgunwale could not agree more: \u201cNigerians are overwhelmed with eking out a living in uncertain time. Condition of living is hard for them and so, the FG must do more than dropping figures to implementing. As an accountant, what I can deduce is that we have implementation problem and all that Covid-19 funds are largely going into pockets of some ministries\u2019 officials, political leaders, and contractors and citizens working for them.\u201d",

          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nFor Titi Adeoye, acting is her second nature. She can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional.\n\nIn this interview, she narrated her journey into the movie industry, her heartbreak experience and greatest fear. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us about yourself and how you came into acting?\n\nI am Titilayomi Adeoye. I hail from the city of Ibadan. I studied Mass Communication at the Polytechnic, Ibadan and after my Industrial Training at Ogun State Television (OGTV); I proceeded for my HND also in Mass Communication. For me, acting is a natural talent from God, it is my second nature and I can play any role spontaneously having been acting in school and church before going professional. I joined Mr. Latin Theater Group in 2007. Mr. Latin gave me the opportunity to act as an agent in the movie titled, Baba Eleran in London. It was a big deal for me at that time.\n\nHow many movies have you featured in till date?\n\nSincerely, I have lost count.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest challenge in the movie industry?\n\nFor me, the only challenge is lack of opportunities to prove my abilities. But as I persevered and turned up at locations on time, each role assigned to me was done perfectly; confidence in me built up and that is how I get other opportunities to showcase my God-given talent.\n\nHave you produced any movie of your own?\n\nYes. I have produced over 10 home movies both in English and Yoruba. I am the producer of Pero, Scuffle, So Far So Close, Okanran, Tewe Tegbo, Eje, Ahon Mi, Omo Mala, Mojere, Ojo Ife Bere and many more.\n\nWhat part of your body do you consider your selling point?\n\nMy pointed nose and boobs.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt\u2019s because I get compliments a lot about them from people.\n\nWhat has fame stolen from you?\n\nI am still myself. I promised myself not to let anything take who I am away from me.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about Titilayomi?\n\nComing out of my shell gradually to do something different.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do for a living?\n\nAside acting, I\u2019m also a realtor. I sell properties\u2026.\n\nAre you in any relationship at the moment?\n\nI would rather not say anything about that. I want to keep my private life private.\n\nWhat\u2019s your greatest fear in life? My greatest fear is failure. So many people look up to me that I can\u2019t afford to let them down.\n\nDo you believe in scandal for fame?\n\nNo. I guide against scandal in all parts. I don\u2019t need to be involved in scandal before I become popular. I love to keep my nose clean always.\n\nWhat\u2019s the highest thing you\u2019ve ever done for your man?\n\nI got him a job, fed him and even clothed him, but the relationship didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t ignore the signs.\n\nWhat is your turn off in a man?\n\nLies and deceits. I can\u2019t stand a man who lies.\n\nCan you have sex on a first date?\n\nNo! Sex is a bond. I need to be connected to you before I can have sex with you.\n\nCan you recount the happiest day of your life?\n\nAnytime I witness the breaking of a new day is my happiest. I don\u203at joke with that great opportunity at all.",

          "text": "From David Onwuchekwa\n\nFirst Aviation Minister in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amechi has tackled President Muhammadu Buhari for describing Ndigbo as a dot-in-a- circle, condemning the wrong choice of words and lack of diplomacy on the part of Mr President.\n\nHe also talked about agitation for self-determination and revealed what he would have done, if he were in President Buhari\u2019s shoes. Chief Amechi who has just clocked 92 years looked at other national issues. Excerpt:\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently called the Igbo a dot in circle. What is your reaction to that?\n\nBuhari\u2019s deep-rooted hatred for Ndigbo is not a new thing. Buhari\u2019s lack of diplomacy even in government and use of diplomatic language or the language that fits a president is well known in Nigeria because as at today, even though Buhari is not wearing a military uniform, he is still the same soldier who overthrew a Fulani-led government in 1983 because the constitution of the then National Party of Nigeria (NPN) said that the next president of the country will be an Igbo man and Buhari swore that an Igbo will never be a president of the country. So, his hatred for Ndigbo and everything Igbo is not a new thing to me. And then his poor choice of language as a president, a real president would have found better words to use than that expression that Ndigbo are a dot in a circle. That is a poor choice of words, very unpresidential. That is all I can say about it. Now, yes, he said that the Southeast, that Igbo do not have access to the sea. There are many countries of the world that have no access to the sea yet they function. I have said it personally that I believe in a bigger country, Nigeria that I fought for. I dedicated my entire youth to the struggle for independence of Nigeria, a big country. And up till today I don\u2019t believe that Nigeria should break. But if Nigeria breaks, Buhari is responsible for the breaking of the country. If this country disintegrates, Buhari should accept total responsibility for it because it is his actions and inactions that have brought the whole thing in Nigeria to the level we are now.\n\nWhat is your opinion about the President\u2019s plan to return grazing routes and open grazing even when the Southern governors have banned it?\n\nThis question of Fulanis and cattle herders and all that is a new language and it only came up in Buhari\u2019s regime. There have been governments in Nigeria. There were NCNC and AG in Nigeria as political parties. There have been military regimes in Nigeria. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle to the East, West and South to sell. Buhari is the only president who wants to equate Fulani economy and empire with his attempt to Fulanize Nigeria and to Islamize Nigeria. That is what is causing the whole trouble. That is for allowing the Fulanis to be armed and allowing his government, people inside his government to arm the herders and they come down here, they shoot people, they damage crops, they rape women, kidnap people and not one of them has been arraigned in any court of law even though those who are arrested and handed over to the police are released the following day. What kind of president is that? The younger elements who are agitating for separation, agitating for Biafra or even the Yoruba now apart from the South-south which is another question which will be dealt with later. Will the South-south talk, are they free to talk?\n\nLet\u2019s leave that. Those who are free to talk are talking. Now, the younger elements say instead of being slaves to Fulanis after coming out from British imperialism to Fulani Empire, the Igbo say we don\u2019t support that. My own case is that the younger elements who did not see how we ran the country before they were born, how there was equity and balance in the country grew up to see themselves marginalized in their own country, rendered poor in the midst of plenty in their own country, and they said no, the system has to be changed because we have never been slaves in our lifetime. Our history shows we have never been slaves, let us go. A human president, a president with human feelings would not have stopped them of that. All he has to do is to conduct a plebiscite and ask Igbo to come and vote whether really they should go based on what these younger elements are saying or remain. How is he (Buhari) sure, in any case that if a plebiscite is called the majority will say we will go. Igbo have so many investments in other parts of Nigeria and West Africa. Igbo abroad are more in population and richer than Igbo at home. And so, they would certainly want that spread to be. The only thing they want is freedom, give us equity and balance that is all they are asking for in the affairs of the country. Let us compete with others, but you cannot come and take our general wealth and deny us our fair share. That is what they are saying. So, the proper thing would have been let\u2019s go and do the plebiscites, if the majority says we will go, let them go in peace. If the majority says we will not go, no we are not going, then they will remain and negotiate and find out what is their anger, what is the problem and all that and then solve them. That is the way I should have handled it, if I were in the position of the president. If the man is the kind of man who would listen to advice, that is what I would have advised him to do. He doesn\u2019t take good advice and always being misled by the cabals around him. He is not free again. Have you seen a president who has never made a speech himself except occasionally when he reads what is written for him by his speech writers and they pass it on to him, which he revises a number of times and then come to read it. After reading it, have you ever seen him take any question from the press? You are a pressman find out.\n\nLet\u2019s return to grazing routes and open grazing.\n\nDespite the ban placed by the Southern Governors, Mr President insists that the ban will not hold.\n\nWhat is your take on that?\n\nThe president has no such power even under the military constitution we are operating in Nigeria. He has no power to decide on land matters in the states. The states have the powers to decide on what to do with land in the individual states not the Federal Government. He cannot implement it, he cannot exercise it, although as a dictator, he can send soldiers to go and show force and all that. But the question is, it is all the same illegality that is going on otherwise he has no powers at all to do that. The presidency has nothing to say about this is a grazing ground, this is not a grazing ground, no. Only states governments have that right.\n\nWhat was the relationship like with nomadic Fulani herders in your days and at what point did we get it wrong?\n\nIn my days, I belonged to a political party that did not discriminate. The Fulanis were bringing their cattle. Those who lived permanently bought the cattle and the cattle were escorted on the roads. There were no so many trailers in our days. They were taking them along the road, but they were not allowed into farms. There was discipline then. Allowing them into farms is to provoke crisis to kill the people and that is what they are doing now. And that is what they continue to do. So, in our own time they mixed up well with our people. There was peace and harmony. One of the Fulanis, Alhaji Umaro was elected a member of Eastern House of Chiefs. Another young Fulani man was made the Mayor of Enugu, a Fulani man from Sokoto. He was elected two terms as a Mayor of Enugu because he was a President of Enugu youth branch of NCNC which I was serving as Secretary General. So, they were just part of us. They had absolute freedom and we were all living in peace and harmony. Nobody disturbed them. They were not particularly educated, but if we found any of them showing interest in education, we encouraged them to embrace education. The point we got it wrong is at the point of Muhammadu Buhari as the president of Nigeria. That was when the whole thing started. It didn\u2019t start in Shagari\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s time, it didn\u2019t start in Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time. It started with President Buhari because of his other ambition of colonizing Nigeria, that Nigeria is a property bequeathed to them by Uthman Dan Fodio. That is the point we got it wrong.\n\nAnambra governorship election will come up on November 6 as scheduled by the INEC. What are your expectations, advice to political parties and Anambra people?\n\nThe individual political parties are doing their game. Some of the aspirants have come to me to inform me they are interested in the election. They asked for my prayer and I prayed that God may make the best among them to lead Anambra for the next four or eight years. It won\u2019t be said that the present government we have is any of the best. That thing there is a one-man show. So, he is going out next year, let him go out. Whosoever wins, let him know that Anambra State has wise men. Anambra has great names and great men in Nigeria. Let him realize that Anambra is full of hard-working men and women. And let him know that Anambra State is a state where people know their rights and are not prepared to shy away from them and then they should stop stealing from government. My doubt about free and fair election is on the interference of Abuja, otherwise if it is a question of voting I have no doubt that there will be free voting. But then manipulating the result is what I don\u2019t know because the constitution is such now that the military in their desire to promote military government in Nigeria concentrated all powers in Abuja. So, Abuja can still interfere, but I do hope they will not. I have not heard that the IPOB said there will be no election. If the election is going to be disturbed it will come from the Federal Government in order to create the atmosphere for a state of emergency in Anambra State. The Federal Government through their secret service, through their Gestapo could or may do it in such a way that it will be said based on this we can declare state of emergency and so forth. So, voters and politicians should be weary of that. They should not give them the chance. I advise Anambra people to do a peaceful election.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nHussaini Salisu is a Fulani rice farmer as well as a herder. He holds the traditional title of Dallatun Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nSalisu is currently the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Livestock Breeders Association of Nigeria (LIBAN), Kaduna State chapter.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he said that Nigerian politicians should stop saying that foreign Fulani are behind kidnapping and banditry in the country, warning that such remarks may provoke Fulani in neighbouring countries to launch attacks on Nigeria.\n\nSalisu also spoke on other national issues. Excerpts:\n\nBy way of introduction, are you a herdsman?\n\nI am the Dallatun of Laduga in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. I am a rice farmer. My parents live in the bush. We farm and rear cattle. We have farmers and cattle rearers whose occupations are being threatened by insecurity, particularly kidnapping and banditry. And the only way out of this insecurity is for the government to be realistic and non-partial in ensuring that peace is restored. Fulani people have been threatened by insecurity and their cows rustled over the years. Now, the government is trying to protect the farmers so that they can work on their farms without fear of being kidnapped. But nobody is talking about protecting the Fulani herdsmen who are rearing cows. They need to be protected too. We Fulani have been cheated, myself in particular, all my cows have been rustled, and I cannot also go to the farm. And somebody will say there will be peace?. I know many people will say Fulani are the bandits, kidnappers, this is how they have been frustrated. If you continue to talk about Fulani this way, they will not have peace and if they don\u2019t have peace, you cannot have peace yourself.\n\nWhat is the implication of farmers not going to the farms because of insecurity?\n\nFood scarcity will continue because the government says it will not import food, and now insecurity does not allow farmers to go to the farms to work. And the little farm products are being bought off by urban traders who travel to the village in search of food. So, urban dwellers rely on rural communities for food. The rural farmers and herders were living peacefully before now until city dwellers brought calamity to them by way of divide and rule in order to buy off their goods at cheaper rates. My parents were the pioneer owners of grazing reserves in Kachia, Kaduna State. My parents sponsored me to school from proceeds realised from the sales of thier cattle. Up till today my parents are in the bush rearing their cattle. But their 5,000 cattle have been reduced to 1,000 now as a result of rustling by criminal elements.\n\nWhat exactly are the causes of farmers/herders clashes in Nigeria?\n\nWhat used to cause farmers/herders clash was due to laying of claims to ownership of land because after the herders have penetrated thick forests and cleared the ways, the farmers would turn round to claim the areas. So, it resulted to clashes between them. But nowadays, there is no farmers/herders clashes. What we have now is communal clashes going on everywhere. Unfortunately, Fulani are the most hated people in Nigeria despite thier desires to live in peace with everybody. You cannot hate Fulani because we are hardworking people. We provide milk for the country, we provide meat for the country, and even the shoes you are wearing are made of cow\u2019s skins. Yet we are being frustrated.\n\nSome of our political leaders said most of the kidnappers and bandits are foreign Fulani. Do you agree?\n\nThose causing kidnapping and banditry are not foreign Fulani. If you say they are foreign Fulani, you are implicating Nigeria because Niger Republic or Burkina Faso and any other neighbouring countries will say you are accusing them unnecessarily. They will hate Nigeria, and you are implicating the country. The Fulani in Nigeria are the most populous in Northern Nigeria. So, if you say there are foreign Fulani in Nigeria, how do you confirm they are foreigners. It is very easy and simple to identify a Fulani man. But to us, any Fulani man you see with cattle, he is of benefit to Nigeria, he is not a foreigner. If we continue to call them foreigners, we are telling the rest of the world that they are criminals. We are implicating Nigeria. This is very unfortunate. Well, if you insist that they are foreigners, you have to identify them. After all Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa are foreigners, everybody comes from somewhere. The world started from somewhere. But if you keep on saying they are foreigners, you are encouraging them to come to Nigeria to join in the fight. When you keep on blackmailing them as foreigners they will come to Nigeria to help Fulani in Nigeria to fight.\n\nHow can kidnapping and banditry be brought to an end?\n\nThose who are into kidnapping are angry and they want to brutalise you because you have taken their products; they have nothing to rear, they have been frustrated, and they are taken to prisons because people believed that they are the bandits. Kidnapping and banditry are being tended towards the Fulani man. I can be innocently picked as bandit and be sent to prison because I am Fulani. Whatever is bad you label it against Fulani man. Fulani people have never committed crime, but you are now forcing them to commit crimes because their means of livelihood have been stolen. Their cows are being rustled. Their houses burnt, our people are killed.\n\nWhat happened to nomadic education put in place for the Fulani herders by previous government?\n\nNobody supported nomadic education to stand the test of time since it was established 35 years ago. Government and the general public did not support nomadic education. It is still at the primary level. It is not supposed to be at the infancy level after 35 years of its foundation. It should be well funded for the betterment of the society. If you are educated you cannot be engaging in criminal activities. The Fulani participated in the nomadic education, but the government did not motivate the school. Most of the classes were under the trees. How can you study under trees in this modern age of Nigeria\u2019s history. They are supposed to build functional schools for them.\n\nDon\u2019t you think dialogue is the way out of the present situation of insecurity between government and bandits?\n\nIs government ready to dialogue with anybody. The government is fighting those who are aggrieved. The government should bring them closer and negotiate with them. Look at what Sheik Ahmed Gumi did, he went to bandits\u2019 enclave, even while all of them were holding gun, trying to negotiate with them. This means that they can be negotiated with. You cannot go closer to any other tribe with gun, but you can go closer to a Fulani man with a gun and tell him to drop the gun, and he will drop it. Yet nobody did that with them. You want to have peace with this people and yet you refused to support Sheik Gumi who told Nigerians that these bandits are ready to make peace, but nobody supported Gumi. How can peace reign when you don\u2019t support somebody who is making the move.\n\nAre you saying that this government does not believe in negotiations with bandits?\n\nAsk yourself, you are a journalists, have you heard where the government is negotiating with them? There is nowhere that negotiation is going on. We have many political associations among the Fulani, nobody is negotiating with them. People who are making room for negotiation are being criticised, they are being called criminals too.\n\nFederal Government has recently resolved to reopen grazing routes across the country. What is your reaction to this?\n\nThat is what President Buhari said, not the government. And what did the southern governors say, they said no to open grazing. Every other Nigerians said no. And they want to have peace. You cannot have peace when you don\u2019t want me to survive. The government should be allowed to create grazing reserves. But animals need to move about because they are not like pigs or goats that you can tie them in one place. You cannot keep 1,000 cows in one place. They cannot survive without moving about. The government is not helping the Fulani if it keeps the cows in one place.\n\nThe argument here is that the era of cows moving about is gone in this modern age and time. Don\u2019t you think so?\n\nThe whole system of Nigeria is not operated in a modern way. When the president wants to make speech he uses microphone; who created the microphone, it is the European. All the technology is from the European people, and yet you said you want to modernise grazing, what are you modernising. Then go ahead and modernise the economy so that everybody becomes rich. If you create grazing reserves for the Fulani, you can then arrest them if they go out of their ways to destroy anything. Take a look at the Kachia grazing reserves, we are living peacefully with the communities and our neighbours, there is no fight between us. They are on their own, we are on our own.\n\nFor some Nigerians who were born and grown in rural communities, they often tell peaceful and cordial relationship with nomadic Fulani. But all of a sudden there was mistrust and suspension between the Fulani and the people in the host communities. What went wrong?\n\nIt is the urban people that brought this disaffection to the Fulani and the local people in the rural communities. The urban people brought calamity to them. They have made them to fight one another.\n\nHow?\n\nLook at the farming system in the country, the farming system is collapsing, rearing is collapsing and the urban people want to survive from the farm produce of the rural dwellers. Now, the local people cannot farm again because of the calamity from the city. For instance, there is a town called Zangon-Kataf in southern Kaduna when the Fulani have been living with the natives for over 300 years until Hausa people from urban areas caused fight for them.\n\nHow did the urban Hausa caused the fight?\n\nThe Hausa urban are traders, they are not farmers. So they manipulate the native farmers, bought off their farm produce at a cheaper price. So also they manipulated the Fulani herders, picked up cows, the meat at cheaper rate. And before you know what was happening, crisis stepped in between the native and the Fulani.\n\nDo you see an end to this crisis?\n\nFrom the beginning of the world crisis was in place. It can never stop, but it can be minimised. However, bombs are being thrown at our cattle.\n\nIn the Southeast, some groups of Igbo are agitating for Biafra republic, and in the Southwest, similar groups are asking for Oduduwa republic. What is your reaction?\n\nWhen such republics are created there will never be peace in Nigeria because we will continue to fight with our former brothers. We will not want to see one another because we were once together as brothers and now you don\u2019t want to see me. They will even fight each other over land because there will not be enough land for them. And whenever they want to travel to any part of the world they must pass through Nigeria. But if they want to separate, let them go. We the Fulani people will survive if the country breaks up because we are the most populous in the North. We are the pioneer rulers of northern Nigeria. All the northern rulers are Fulani from inception.\n\nWhy are you addressed as Hausa/Fulani?\n\nWell, if they want to benefit from us, they address us Hausa/Fulani. We are Fulani, so you cannot call us Igbo/Fulani. If Hausa want to benefit from us they hide under our name. If it is a wrong thing, they say they are Hausa. If it is a right thing, they will say they are part of the Fulani. Once you are a Muslim from Niger Republic and enter Nigeria you become an Hausa man. Even as a Nigerian once you are a Muslim people tend to call you Hausa.",

          "text": "From Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nSoutheast governors and other leaders in the zone have called on their Northern counterparts to protect the Igbo living in the North.\n\nThe call was made during an emergency security meeting of Southeast leaders in Enugu yesterday.\n\nThe meeting which was attended by ministers, political, religious and traditional leaders from the zone was a follow-up to a similar meeting with a presidential delegation led by the Minister of Defence, Maj.Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd) on June 11.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the end of the meeting, Chairman of South East Governors Forum and Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, regretted that although leaders in the zone had reassured the people from other regions of their safety, Ndigbo are still being threatened, especially in the North.\n\nHe maintained that the impression that leaders in the zone were silent over the rising wave of agitation was wrong as they have come out publicly to speak against the agitations.\n\n\u201cWe have noted threats by some groups against our people of Southeast, while we firmly promise to protect everyone either from other regions or ours, we plead with the leaders of other regions to protect our people living in their regions.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the killing of security agencies, burning of infrastructure facilities and killing of civilians in Southeast and even in other regions. We request our security agencies to discharge their duties with the rules of engagement and law.\n\n\u201cWe condemn in totality the activities of violence and secessionist group in Southeast and elsewhere. We firmly proclaim that we do not support them because they do not speak for Southeast.

          "title": "Bawa: EFCC Won\u2019t Hand over Cases of Interest to any State",
          "text": "\u2022Says commission as a creation of N\u2019Assembly supersedes states\u2019 establishments\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nChairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declared that the commission, under his leadership, would not hand over cases of interest to any state government. Bawa spoke against the backdrop of the setting up of anti-corruption agencies by some states.\n\nLagos, Kano, and Bayelsa states have, recently, set up anti-graft agencies. Some of the states envisage that the EFCC would hand over corruption cases concerning their states to the local anti-corruption commissions.\n\nThe EFCC chairman also denied asking the management teams of banks to declare theirs assets to the commission. He insisted his pronouncement was merely for purposes of eliciting information, as the agency was not empowered to dish out such an order.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the EFCC boss stated that as a creation of the National Assembly, the federal agency superseded any similar agency set up by the states.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am aware that Kano and Bayelsa have started their own anti-corruption agencies. But those laws do not contain anything that says that EFCC has nothing to do with investigating their states, they would rather be complementing what the EFCC is doing.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Supreme Court decided cases on this particular issue. From the briefing that I have received, those things are already there. The EFCC is a creation of the National Assembly, which, of course, supersedes, when it comes to that. So, there\u2019s already a federal legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see how the EFCC is going to hand over cases that they are interested in to any state government or see any correspondence to that effect. We are investigating our matters. In that regard, we are making progress.\u201d\n\nBawa also expressed doubt over the capacity of states to handle certain investigations in view of the capital-intensive nature.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat I can say is that law enforcement is a very, very expensive venture and requires a lot of training and retraining, with trends of crime developing everyday, every second, and you need to catch up with people doing that.\n\n\u201cTake, for instance, issues of money laundering, where, maybe, somebody somewhere has laundered the proceeds of crime, let\u2019s say somewhere in Sokoto and you are in Oyo State or you have property, a lot of things will come up.\n\n\u201cMaybe he has property in America, you need to carry out request, involving mutual legal assistance treaty between, let\u2019s say, Nigeria and America, whether or not the American government will recognise that.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of things left, right and centre are at play regarding it. It is very, very expensive.\n\n\u201cThen, the issue of capacity. Yes, anybody can develop a capacity to do that. But let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAddressing the alleged demand for declaration of assets by bankers, Bawa said it was within the powers of the agency to make such demands.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cI did not say banks will come and declare their assets to us. It is not within our powers to demand for that. But it is within our powers to demand for information. You and associate (s) without any hindrance or failure must give us information on demand.\n\n\u201cIf you are an individual or corporate entity or company, it is an offence not to comply. That is why we write to individuals, politicians to submit to us so that we will compare, because if you are a suspect, before us, you are expected to even fill our own declaration of assets form here.\u201d\n\nHe explained further, \u201cWe write to CCB, for instance, to furnish us what you declared. Yes, we write them to give us information on what you declared so that we can make comparison.\n\n\u201cWe have our reason for saying that come June 1st, we are going to demand for the declaration of assets. That\u2019s what I said. So, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have not declared, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you have done anything, but what we said is that we are going to demand for it.\n\n\u201cYou understand this? This is in a 1986 law. It was passed when I was just six years old. Yes, it\u2019s an old law and they are expected to declare their assets annually. So, what we said is that we just need copies of those things, we have already demanded. On June 1st, we wrote to all the banks, the MDS and DMDs should submit copies of their declaration of asset form.\n\nOn accusations that the agency had engaged in media trial of suspects, the EFCC chairman said the commission on his watch had not only conducted diligent investigations but had also contributed significantly to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 15 years.\n\nBawa stated, \u201cNow, rightly or wrongly, the media, once matters are in court, you have the right to go and get the facts \u2013 reporters are always in court to report what has happened. So, you have been accusing us wrongly of this.\n\n\u201cYou did mention something that we do media trial, and then we rush to court. There is no agency of government that has worked and contributed to the development of law in this country in the last 15 years than the EFCC. Nobody has challenged me on that.\n\n\u201cWe go to court. We love going to court. We have 90 per cent to 95 per cent success rate in court on the cases that we have charged. So, it is not about stating the facts and losing cases. Assuming we have 70 per cent success rate in court, is it not an A that you will give us, but as you know, we have over 90 per cent success rate in court.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have changed our strategy in that regard as well. And that is why maybe you are not seeing people under investigation being mentioned in the media.\n\n\u201cBut there was never a deliberate attempt, anyway, to do that (media trial). We are just trying to do things by the book but maybe that is the change of strategy that you people have observed. We are working quietly and diligently on cases without necessarily drawing public attention.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Reaffirm commitment to one Nigeria\n\nChristopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nLeaders from the South-east zone, yesterday, announced the setting up of different committees to engage agitating youths in the area as part of new initiatives for a lasting peace. This followed a meeting in Enugu State.\n\nThe leaders, who met for the second time in two weeks, reaffirmed their commitment to a united Nigeria, and rejected the agitation by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) for a Republic of Biafra.\n\nAccording to a communiqu\u00e9 read by the chairman of South-east Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, the South-east leaders said in order not to manage the situation in the zone, they \u201chave set up a committee to engage such youths to stop and allow elders speak to address such fears\u201d.\n\nRegarding the safety of the Igbo in other parts of the country, and the newly established regional security outfit, the communiqu\u00e9 said the \u201cmeeting directed our governors and Ohaneze Ndigbo to liaise with indigenes from the northern part of Nigeria and indigenes of other regions to assure the nation, Nigeria, and their people of their safety in South-east.\u201d\n\nThe committees set up, according to the communiqu\u00e9, were those on \u201cagitation; engagement with other regions; those of our people in the North, South-east, South-south and South-west; IPOB, MASSOB, youths and market people, Okada and Keke; diaspora; advocacy; and diplomatic engagement with foreign missions.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was a follow-up to the one the leaders held with the presidential delegation, led by the Minister of Defence, Maj.Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), on June 11, in the wake of the rising insecurity in the region.\n\nUmahi, who read from the communiqu\u00e9 said, the leaders had reaffirmed their commitment to one nation built on fairness, love and respect for one another. He added that the committees were to help articulate the demands of the region, particularly as it relates to insecurity, and meet with the federal government.\n\nThe governor regretted that although leaders in the South-east had reassured people from other regions of their safety, Ndigbo were still being threatened, especially, in the north.\n\n\u201cWe call on leaders in other regions to take note of the threats and take proper action,\u201d he said, adding that the leaders condemned the killing of security operatives and destruction of security facilities in the zone.\n\nHe maintained that the impression that leaders in the zone were silent over the rising wave of agitation was, wrong as they had come out publicly to speak against the agitations.\n\nUmahi said, \u201cWe have again endorsed Ebubeagu and asked them to work with security agencies to ensure the protection of lives and property of the people in the South-east.\u201d\n\nHe called on security operatives working in the region to operate within the confines of the law.\n\nThose present at the meeting included the host, Governor of Enugu State, Hon.

          "title": "Falana: APC Has Perfected Plans to Rule Nigeria Indefinitely",
          "text": "\u2022Laments Buhari\u2019s failure to amend 2010 Electoral Act\n\n\u2022Says demand for self-determination, a constitutional right\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nUnlike the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that boasted to rule Nigeria for 60 years, Nigeria\u2019s foremost human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN) yesterday disclosed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) had perfected plans to rule the country indefinitely.\n\nFalana, a former President of the West African Bar Association (WABA), also said the Electoral Amendment Bill might not be signed into law citing the failure of the National Assembly to complete the process of its enactment and transmit it to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\n\nHe expressed these grave concerns during an exclusive interview with THISDAY yesterday, pointing out how the Buhari administration reneged on different promises made to Nigerians during presidential campaigns in 2014.\n\nFalana, who spoke on diverse issues of national concerns during the interview, said: \u201cUnlike the PDP, which boasted that it would rule Nigeria for 60 years, the APC has perfected plans to rule Nigeria indefinitely.\n\n\u201cHence, the new Electoral Amendment Bill is not likely to be signed into law. Very soon, Nigerians will be told that the bill cannot be signed by the president since the 2023 elections are around the corner,\u201d he observed.\n\nReflecting on Buhari\u2019s breach of campaign promises, Falana explained how the APC had campaigned to reform the electoral process by implementing the recommendations of the Justice Muhammed Uwais Electoral Reform Panel before the 2015 elections\n\nUpon assumption of power, however, the human rights lawyer noted with grave concern that the ruling party reneged on its pact with the people on electoral reform.\n\nBefore the Ekiti State governorship election in 2014, he explained how some APC leaders obtained court orders, which restrained the Jonathan administration from deploying the armed forces in the management of elections.\n\nHe, however, said: \u201cThe APC government deploys armed military and police personnel in the manipulations of elections including local government elections. As if that is not enough, voters are induced with money, rice, beans and salt in utter contravention to the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nOn these grounds, the senior advocate claimed that the Buhari administration had failed to reform the country\u2019s dysfunctional electoral system after six years in the saddle, hence contravening its campaign promise.\n\nBefore the 2015 elections, the APC entrenched restructuring in its manifesto and campaigned for power devolution from the centre to the other federating units, one of the reasons it garnered popular support nationwide.\n\nApart from its promise to devolve powers to the federating units, the APC also campaigned to reform the country\u2019s electoral system in line with the recommendation of the Justice Muhammed Uwais Electoral Reform Panel.\n\nOn December 7, 2018, Buhari rejected the Electoral Amendment Bill that could have transformed the country\u2019s electoral system positively on the ground that it could affect the 2019 elections contrary to these promises.\n\nIn the same way, the president had not taken any concrete step to implement the report of the APC Committee on True Federalism; the outcome had fuelled agitations either for return to regional government or outright separation from Nigeria in different parts of the country.\n\nDespite Buhari\u2019s lukewarm approach to comprehensive electoral reforms, Falana challenged the National Assembly to fast-track the process of amending the Electoral Amendment Bill ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe recommended the need to legalise the use of card readers and electronic voting and collation of results and direct transmission to INEC central server.\n\nHe urged the National Assembly to prioritise the review of the Electoral Amendment Bill since the president did not sign the bill into law in 2018 on the ground that it was too close to the last general election.\n\nThe human rights lawyers observed that the new bill \u201chas not been passed and forwarded to the president for his assent for reasons best known to both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe delay is affecting the preparations of INEC for the 2023 general election. It is high time sufficient pressure was mounted on the federal legislators to pass the Electoral Amendment Bill as a further delay will adversely affect the conduct and management of future elections in the country.\n\n\u201cBut it is doubtful if the country can hold a peaceful general election in 2023. In 2015, the Jonathan administration postponed the general election for six weeks because some local governments in Borno State were under the control of terrorists.\n\n\u201cToday, a number of state governments and hundreds of local governments are under either total or partial control of insurgents, bandits and other gunmen. It is hoped that the federal government will not invoke and apply Section 135 of the 1999 Constitution,\u201d he observed\n\nHe noted that the section empowered the president \u201cto postpone elections if he considers that it is not practicable to hold elections on the ground that the country is involved in a war in which its territory is physically involved.\n\n\u201cThis is why all hands should be on deck to enact a new electoral law, which should provide for electronic voting. That is the only way to ensure that elections are conducted in many parts of the country at any given time.\u201d\n\nFalana, also, faulted the president\u2019s threat to use brute force in response to the demand for self-determination by some separatist movements nationwide, especially, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nHe explained that Nigeria had ratified and domesticated the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, which guaranteed rights to self-determination.\n\nUnder Article 20, Falana pointed out that the charter \u201cguarantees the right of the Nigerian people to self-determination. On that basis, the demand for the breakup of Nigeria is not a criminal offence.\u201d\n\nIf demand for self-determination was anchored on violence, the senior advocate said Nigeria would not hesitate to frame charges, which reinforced the position of the federal government to blame the killing of security personnel and destruction of government properties on the IPOB.\n\n\u201cWhile I do not support the serious breakdown of law and order in some states in the Southeast, I am interested in addressing the root cause of the crisis. That can only be achieved if the separatist groups are given the opportunity to dialogue and negotiate with the federal government and the state governments over their grievances,\u201d Falana suggested.\n\nHe justified his position on the ground that the federal government had negotiated with terrorists and bandits and granted amnesty to many of them in spite of their involvement in crimes against humanity such as gang-raping of women, abduction and killing of innocent people, displacement of millions of others whose houses were set ablaze.\n\nHe emphasised the need for the federal government \u201cto appreciate that the crisis of global capitalism has forced millions of young people to embrace supremacist ideology with emphasis on balkanisation of many countries.\u201d\n\nHe, thus, said the demand for separation was not peculiar to Nigeria, citing how in the United States, a faction of the Republican Party led by former President Donald Trump has become popular among the white community, because of the campaign to chase away immigrants from the country.\n\nHe, also, pointed at how the United Kingdom \u201chas pulled out of the European Union while the people of Scotland are fighting for independence. In Spain, the people of Catalonia are fighting for independence. In Canada, the people of Quebec are fighting for independence.\n\n\u201cThe story is the same in other parts of the world. The campaign for the balkanisation of Nigeria has been influenced by developments in the West,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, noted that the campaign \u201cis fully supported by diaspora Nigerians. Based on arrogance of power, the federal government has continued to play into the hands of the campaigners for the balkanisation of the country.\u201d\n\nConsequently, Falana observed that the agitation had been fuelled by nepotism, lopsided appointments, corruption, impunity, ethnic politics and the zealous implementation of neoliberal economic policies, which had been worsening unemployment, poverty and unemployment.\n\nOut of sheer frustration, according to the human rights lawyer, the campaign for the breakup of the country is gaining momentum.\n\n\u201cI have continued to insist that it is no longer acceptable to say that the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable, because it is an indissoluble and indivisible entity.\u201d\n\nTo respond to the agitations, Falana recommended that the federal government \u201chas to jettison its arrogance of power and enter into meaningful dialogue with all separatist groups and other aggrieved citizens.\n\n\u201cThe federal government may realise rather too late that no amount of brute force can silence the separatist groups. If the government defeat them militarily, they may go underground and embark on guerilla warfare.\n\n\u201cThe earlier the war mongering tactics of the government is reviewed the better for the corporate existence of Nigeria. I do not need to be a war expert to know that the armed forces cannot win the war on insurgents, bandits and separatists at the same time,\u201d he said with concern for the future of Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Bagudu visits school, promises all abductees will be rescued\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Ismail Adebayo in Birnin Kebbi\n\nOne of the students abducted by bandits who attacked the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, last Thursday night has died during a crossfire between the kidnappers and security agents.\n\nThe kidnappers, who stormed the school in large number, were armed with sophisticated weapons, abducted 30 students, and killed a policeman. A teacher, a vice-principal, the school\u2019s security officer, and the wife of a teacher, were also abducted.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State visited the affected school yesterday, where he met with the parents, and promised that all abducted students would be freed.\n\nThe shootout that claimed the life of the student happened yesterday morning when the fleeing kidnappers ran into men of the Joint Taskforce of Operation Hadarin Daji in the North-West Zone, at a roadblock, while heading out of Kebbi State.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Force Commander, Operation Hadari Daji, Air Commodore Abubakar Abdulkadir, as a result of the duel, the bandits were forced to abandon five students and a teacher.\n\nSadly, one of the students, who was unidentified, died in the crossfire. No further detail was given on how the death occurred.\n\nAbdulkadir said: \u201cIn the early hours of this morning, we came across the kidnappers. They came to our blocking point, and we engaged them. At that point, they abandoned five of the students and one of the teachers. Unfortunately, I think we lost one of the students.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army in a statement yesterday confirmed the death of the student but attributed the death to \u201cexhaustion during a rescue operation as troops of Operation Hadarin Daji engaged kidnappers in a fire-fight, culminating in the rescue of five students and two teachers of Federal Government College, Yauri.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by the Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops had launched a manhunt for the kidnappers and bandits, following the abduction of the students.\n\n\u201cThe rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today (yesterday) 18 June 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yauri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled, with one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,\u201d it said.\n\nThe update on the abduction said the land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission, intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 am.\n\nIt said the troops also recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits and maintained that the gallant troops were still on the heels of the kidnappers to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity.\n\n\u201cThe rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State Government. The Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good-spirited citizens and wishes to solicit more. \u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya has directed the commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones,\u201d it said.\n\nThe rescued students and teachers are currently receiving medical treatment at the Yauri General Hospital.\n\nBagudu Promises Freedom for Abducted Students\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bagudu yesterday met with parents of abducted Yauri students at the school premises, assuring them that they would be rescued soon.\n\nHe assured the parents that the state government, relevant security agencies, and the presidency were working together to rescue the student from the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do anything to bring the children back. We have already engaged the necessary security agencies and they are working to rescue them. All we need to do we have done. What we need from you are your prayers and support.\u201d\n\nBagudu said the state government was alerted two weeks ago that the bandits were sighted around the school area, adding: \u201cWe planned to move them but the school authorities said the students have two weeks left to write their final exams. For this, the commissioner of police was gracious enough to dispatch 22 men and officers from the counter-terrorism unit to the school but they were overpowered because the bandits came in hundreds.\u201d\n\n\u2018How Bandits Took Our Children Away\u2019\n\nWorried parents of the abducted Yauri students yesterday narrated to Governor Bagudu how the bandits came in hundreds, overran the security at the school, and went away with many students.\n\nA parent and one of the cooks engaged for the security personnel deployed to the school, Mrs. Aliheri Gabonchok said she was at the kitchen when the bandits stormed the premises and started shooting sporadically.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen they came, I rushed into hiding with some of the students I could gather. I told them to lie down till the gunshot subsided. I came out when they had left, only to hear from other staff, who also escaped, that they went away with some students, school staff, and even my husband.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Ainan Muhammed, said the bandits who invaded the school were about 400.\n\nAnother parent, Aliyu Wushishi said his five children were among those abducted by the bandits and appealed to the governor to do whatever he could do to rescue the students from the bandits.\n\nThe Emir of Yauri, Dr. Sayyanu Abdullahi charged the government to have the political will to deal with banditry.\n\nThe emir also said people in the various communities should see it as their duty to expose those serving as informants to bandits in their communities.\n\nThe royal father gave the charge when governor Badugu visited his palace in Yauri after meeting with some parents of the abducted students.\n\nVehicle Used for Abduction\n\nMeanwhile, the police command in Kebbi State yesterday explained that one of the vehicles used for the kidnaping belongs to a high court judge in the state.\n\nNafi\u2019u Abubakar, the Kebbi police spokesman, said the van was hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road.\n\nAbubakar said the police are yet to determine the number of students kidnapped from the school located in Ngaski LGA of the state.\n\nHe said the reports making the rounds that 50 students were kidnapped from the school were false.\n\nThe Kebbi police spokesman said: \u201cThe attention of the police has been drawn to reports made by some media stations that a police vehicle was used in kidnapping about 50 students of the FGC. A White Hilux Van with registration No. kBSJ 29 belonging to a High Court judge with the inscription of Kebbi State Judiciary, hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road was the one used in the kidnapping and not a police vehicle as stated by some media stations.\n\n\u201cThe command wishes to make it clear and set the records straight that yet to be ascertained number of students are still missing as rescue operation is still ongoing.\u201d\n\nThough the Kebbi State Government and the school\u2019s authorities are yet to release the official number of students and staff abducted in the school, unofficial sources said, in all, 30 students and four officials were kidnapped.\n\n\u201c25 students and two officials of the school are still with the kidnappers,\u201d said a source close to the school.\n\nYauri Lawmaker Laments\n\nThe lawmaker representing the Igaski/Shanga/Yauri in Kebbi State at the House of Representatives, Yusuf Sununu, has lamented attacks by bandits in Kebbi State.\n\nSununu warned that the growing insecurity in Kebbi State was a major threat to food security in the country.\n\nSununu said the pervading insecurity in the country was becoming worrisome, saying, \u201cgone are the days when Kebbi used to be the most peaceful in the country.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits \u2013 according to eyewitnesses \u2013 numbering about 250 to 300, each with an AK-47 rifle and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency. They had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, going from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles, and cattle. That led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons to the headquarters of the emirate in the town of Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back, and in the early hours of today, they repeated what they had done earlier, and they came into the constituency, somehow around 10:30 am or thereabout. They were able to gain access after strong fights with some security guards and policemen guarding the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, and they made their way into the school.\n\n\u201cThis is a cause for concern and as representative of the people, I had to come here and make a call on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State. It has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the bank of River Niger. We fear that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now, we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security. I have got in touch with security agencies. We had discussions and it has been confirmed to me that military aircraft are in surveillance in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have to make it clear that Kebbi State and indeed Yauri holds a unique position in the food security of this country. Over 90 per cent of the land of Yauri is for rice farming. But as of today, no farmer can comfortably go back to his farm and farm and come back to sleep with his eyes closed.\n\n\u201cWe are right now facing an influx of some people into Yauri with a higher rate of internally displaced persons. Accommodation, feeding, and other necessary logistics are being affected. The worst part of it is that a nation can only develop when it is sound educationally.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Boko Haram is almost becoming a reality because parents cannot feel free to send their wards to school for fear of being kidnapped. As it is now, a lot of primary schools in the emirate in Yauri town are being occupied by IDPs. This tends to deter the progress so far achieved by the Kebbi State Government in terms of agriculture and in terms of promoting access to education.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The World Needs To Act Now Before COVID-19 Overwhelms Africa, By Mosoka P. Fallah And Zacharia Kafuko",
          "text": "So far Africa has survived the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in spite of its weak health systems, limited health care workforce and crumbling infrastructure. The continent as a whole experienced low official case and death rates either due to inadequate testing (and treatment) or other factors such as age, genetics and previous infections. This has led to a degree of complacency- many countries have abandoned social distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing while others have encouraged large social, political and religious gatherings. Decreased community testing has undermined any efforts to determine the true magnitude of community transmission or the spread of new variants. At the same time, Africa has the fewest vaccines of any continent in the world, with only 32 million people receiving a dose, from a total population of over 1.3 billion people. Compare this to India where 255.3 million people have received one dose and the US where more than 311 million doses have been administered. Accordingly, Dr. Matshidiso Moeiti, Regional Director for the WHO in Africa, has pointed out that, \u201cIn sub-Saharan Africa, we are at an average of one COVID-19 vaccine dose per 100 people, compared to a global average of 23, and 62 in high-income countries.\u201d This translates to 1% vaccines access, while the global average is 23% and the Global North is 62%.\n\nThe continent has a dismally low supply of oxygen cylinders, monitors and other relevant tools needed to treat infected patients. Added to its original low supplies, the continent has received just 3,700 oxygen concentrators, 1,300 patient monitors and 700 ventilators through the United Nations Supply Portal since the start of the pandemic. For a continent with 1.3 billion people, these paltry supplies are nowhere near sufficient.\n\nDr. Moeti has spoken about the status of the pandemic in Africa on 10th June: \u201cIn the past week, 88,000 new COVID-19 cases were reported \u2013 an increase of 9 percent over the previous week. We are seeing rising cases in South Africa and Uganda, and cases have increased abruptly in 8 countries, including Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Liberia, the B117 COVID-19 variant has been detected with a 64% mortality rate within 28 days, which is deeply worrying. The country has reported 202 cases in the past week, the highest number of cases in any previous one week period. In Uganda patients are dying outside hospitals while waiting for beds. In Namibia, COVID-19 has overwhelmed all existing hospitals leading to the suspension of all life-threatening surgeries, while in South Africa the intensive care hospitals are filling up at alarming rates. In West Africa, there are one to four variant strains in all 16 ECOWAS countries.\n\nAfrica is woefully unprepared for a massive third wave of the kind that has been faced by South Asia recently.\n\nThe COVAX platform-created to make vaccines available to the most vulnerable populations has been hamstrung by vaccine nationalism and vaccine diplomacy. Most countries in Africa have received less than 2% of the vaccines expected through the COVAX platform. Ghana, the first country in Africa to receive the COVAX doses got 600,000 doses for its 31.4 million population- representing a 0.96% potential coverage for the two-dose vaccine regimen. Zambia received 228,000 doses against its 18.8 million population translating to a 0.6% potential coverage of the double dose vaccine. If we are to support African countries to vaccinate their populations, the COVAX donors need to rapidly ramp up their deliveries or we need to find ways to arrange bilateral vaccine donations.\n\nWe have been working with Ebola response veterans and a global team of doctors, scientists, bioethicists, and professors to advance practical solutions to avert a COVID-19 driven catastrophe in Africa. This involves a focus on vaccine donations now to the countries most in need; additional funding for COVAX to purchase and distribute 225 million more doses of vaccines for Africa; and tiered pricing for vaccines so African countries can procure vaccines directly.\n\nTo overcome the challenges we face, the world must come together- as it did during the Ebola crisis of 2014/15- to overcome geopolitical differences, counter bottlenecks in production and increase the pace of vaccinations globally. All countries should immediately underwrite initiatives aimed at increasing access to vaccines by supporting ethical standards that call on improved global vaccine access.\n\nThe COVID-19 situation in India recently has been an unmitigated disaster- the potential for a similar crisis in Africa is clear. Our continent is not adequately equipped to handle a major surge of the coronavirus. We must prepare for the worst and hope for the best.",

But we also need to mobilise, kit ourselves and take on these bandits.\n\n\u201cOur various scriptures as Muslims and Christians allow us to put our lives at risk in defence of our honour, property and our faiths. In what the bandits are doing, they have challenged all these. So, we can\u2019t let them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Birnin Yauri should be the last straw. We should follow these bandits wherever they are and take them on.\u201d\n\nBagudu commended security agencies, management of the school, and vigilantes for their combined efforts.\n\nAddressing the hunters, Fayemi said he was in the state as a representative of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF).\n\n\u201cWe are here in solidarity with our brother, the governor of Kebbi state, and all the good people of Kebbi state on the unfortunate incident at FGC Birnin Yauri,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know the fight the police in Yauri put against the bandits. We know as leaders of local hunters, you will go fight them in the bush and defeat them. Whatever you can do to make it the last one in Kebbi, please put up the effort.\u201d\n\nResponding, Hassan Muhammad, leader of the hunters in Gwandu emirate, promised that the hunters would do their best to secure the release of the remaining abducted persons.",

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kiishu* was still running her undergraduate course when she decided to explore other parts of the country for her six-month internship program. Miles away from home in South-southern Nigeria, she was having an enjoyable learning experience, but with two months to go, she had an awful experience.\n\nShe was sexually assaulted by her host\u2019s friend, who visited, knowing his friend was away on a trip.\n\n\u201cIt was a cold and sad evening,\u201d she recounts, \u201cbut help came, albeit late.\u201d\n\nA trip to the police station provided no succour, even though they knew the culprit. She would eventually be bullied by the perpetrator\u2019s influential family to agree to arbitration outside court \u2014 presided over by her workplace\u2019s governing authority \u2014 with the culprit having only to sign an undertaking to stay away from her after admitting to the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but I agreed to take it because I had a short time to spend there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, neither my sponsors nor I could think of any other channel to get help.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, but unfortunately, varying degrees of sexual offences are still perpetrated daily, with statistics confirming an increased incidence of the global crime. The United Nations (UN) affirms that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence.\n\nDespite the Nigerian Federal Government launching its first sexual offender register in November 2019, there were so many cases of sexual violence in 2020. Consequently, all 36 state governors declared a state of emergency on rape, agreed to set up a sex offender register, and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nIn May 2021, Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nHighlighting existing response channels\n\nJust like Kiishu, most sexual assault survivors don\u2019t bother to report their experiences. Their overriding emotion is often fear that their complaints won\u2019t get the required attention, and they\u2019d either be blamed or stigmatised. There is also the possibility that the perpetrator would not be brought to book, further putting them in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHowever, the number of channels currently available to report such cases have increased compared to recent years. Victim support groups, activist movements, non-profit establishments, government-owned humanitarian agencies, and global organisations like the UN are just a few of the options available to victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA friend introduced me to this support group that helped me talk about my experience. Even though it was years after the incident, I experienced closure and felt I could properly get justice if I wanted to,\u201d Kiishu relays.\n\nApart from support groups, there is the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), a government-owned organisation that monitors trafficking and sexual-based violence cases.\n\nInterestingly, they have multiple channels \u2014 one of which I tried during my investigation \u2014 for receiving and addressing complaints.\n\nI called the conspicuously written toll-free number on the NAPTIP website and got through to a representative in less than 60 seconds; receiving a response redirecting me to the office closest to me took less than 120 seconds. While the response time was quick, I have no idea how long it would have taken to dispatch help to my location had I been in danger.\n\nThe Agency\u2019s impressive setup is the result of deliberate work done over time.\n\nMr Ganiu Aganran, NAPTIP Zonal Commander for Lagos State, who leads the Sexual and Gender-based Violence unit, tells Techpoint Africa that different tech-enabled channels have made it easier to access help.\n\n\u201cAt the headquarters, we have a 24-hour monitoring centre. When a call is put through, whatever is said is recorded and sent to the appropriate command that will handle it in real-time. We also receive SOS through the website and emails.\u201d\n\nThough he cannot speak to the number of reported cases and prosecuted offenders, he says that \u201cin the Lagos Zonal Command, sometimes, in a week, we have nothing less than 35 cases coming in, including those that come from sister law enforcement agencies through referrals.\u201d\n\nAganran says that social media has been a great tool, and with action taken to address the many cases reported on social platforms, his claim appears to be true.\n\nBetween March and June 2020, several campaigns aimed at getting justice for rape victims trended on social media.\n\nHowever, Aganran submits that the same channel is also responsible for the increasing cases of sexual violence and human trafficking.\n\nHe admits that the Agency would have been able to do more if it has more tools to work with. There are limitations apart from funding,\n\n\u201cThe issue of tracking could come in, but we do tracking through our partners, especially the DSS or the police. These are some of the law enforcement agencies that have this technology, which may not be available when we have to check the environment well to respond promptly.\u201d\n\nHowever, with relevant partnerships, he concludes that the agency can cover more ground.\n\nMore hands at work\n\nAganran attests that the Agency usually looks to partner with private organisations \u2014 for public awareness campaigns, information gathering, and referrals, among others \u2014 so it does not get overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe can never have it enough; there are challenges. The issue of logistics is key. You need to be able to move your victims when you rescue them. There are other things like going to court, going to arrest, and going for surveillance; all these demand a lot. But the truth is that working closely with partners, they also come to our aid.\u201d\n\nApart from NAPTIP partners, there are platforms operating in Nigeria that do the same thing.\n\nWhat survivors want: Enter WARIF\u2026\n\nWARIF Webpage\n\nFor obvious reasons, what a survivor wants is to be heard, cared for, and defended. The Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) is a non-profit organisation launched in 2016 to respond to and care for young girls and women who are victims of rape.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s website serves as a channel for anonymous reporting, legal and health assistance, and evidence gathering for the police. It also has a feature that allows survivors to have virtual group therapy.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, it improved the platform\u2019s live chat feature and looked for cases on social media.\n\nGovernment-owned agencies also refer cases to WARIF\u2019s rape crisis centre. And Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, WARIF Founder, disclosed that the centre received up to 300 cases between March and April 2020 in Lagos State.\n\n\u2026 and Helpio app\n\nHelpio App About Page\n\nIn August 2020, Kano-based Android developer and women-in-tech advocate, Sa\u2019adat Aliyu, launched Helpio app, a platform for reporting sexual abuse cases in Nigeria.\n\nAvailable in both Hausa and English languages, users can sign up either as an emergency help centre, report anonymously, share a story, render legal assistance, or provide counselling.\n\nAliyu informs Techpoint Africa that she was inspired to build the platform during the lockdown to remove the hindrances to reporting cases of sexual and gender-based violence and get survivors closer to help.\n\nShe believes that many rape cases are unreported because of the associated stigma. History also plays a part as there are fewer cases of victims getting justice than perpetrators going scot-free.\n\nThis can be put down either to inadequate legal representation or poverty. However, there are non-governmental organisations set up solely to fight against SGBV, which provide financial, legal, medical, or even socio-psychological support to victims of sexual abuse.\n\nWithin the first ten months of launch, the platform already has support groups and certified organisations \u2014 for confidentiality \u2014 signed up to help with reported cases and emergency calls. And for cases requiring counselling, there are experts available for live chats.\n\nStill in its early stage, Aliyu says the platform undergoes regular changes to improve user experience. Subsequently, the platform will reflect real-time statistics of cases and include more localised languages.\n\nShe hopes to get more people to use the platform and render more help.\n\n\u201cThrough the app, over 50+ cases were reported, and the \u201ctalk to experts\u201d feature was among the most-used in the application.\u201d\n\nAganran explains that having recognised their reach, the government wants to take advantage of the opportunities created by platforms like WARIF and Helpio.\n\nWith more tech tools in place, there\u2019s no telling how many cases will be reported, and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nAganran believes that doing nothing isn\u2019t an option as everyone must intervene, show support, or help survivors get what they want.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "text": "Looking at where Nigeria is today, in terms of worsening insecurity, poverty, economic malaise, among other ills, many Nigerians are wondering what the state of the nation will look like in the next two years when the current administration is expected to come to an end.\n\nSome have described the next two years as an \u201ceternity\u201d, saying that to endure the \u201csuffocating air\u201d for the next two years would be the worst punishment for Nigerians.\n\nDuring the 2015 general election campaign, the then ruling party and the main opposition party promised Nigerians a lot of goodies.\n\nThe campaign afforded the then opposition the platform to blame the insecurity, economic woes, and every other problem in Nigeria on the failure of the then ruling party.\n\nBut as much as Nigerians quickly concluded that the messiah has come, they seemed to have never enjoyed any relief since the then opposition party came to power.\n\nFor many, the situation has degenerated from bad to worse in all fronts; from economy, social life, healthcare, and especially tackling insecurity, which many considered as reason the opposition won in 2015.\n\nInflation, unemployment rate, death rate, debt profile among other negative trends have more than quadrupled in the last six years of this administration and the remaining two years may likely make no difference.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer Boko Haram and North East. Now bandits, kidnapers, and herdsmen have taken the war to all parts of the country. There are killings every day and the government, which promised to tackle insecurity keeps doing little or nothing to tackle it,\u201d Yohanna Bulus, a lawyer and an aggrieved indigene of Borno State, decried.\n\n\u201cHow can Boko Haram hoist its flag in Nigeria and nothing is happening, government negotiates ransom with bandits and kidnapers take a whole school or town hostage without challenge. Nigeria is in a war situation now,\u201d Bulus observed.\n\nFor the Lagos-based maritime lawyer, the country is fast drifting apart and the principals and political actors are not keen on saving the situation because it is going according to their long-hatched plans.\n\n\u201cIf government wants to calm the situation and restore peace across the country, it will do it. But it does not want for obvious reasons; instead, it is threatening to roll out tanks in some parts of the country. You heard what they reeled out as achievements since gaining power; in sincerity, have there been achievements in a country where government is witnessing ethnic cleansing and wanton killings every day and keep silent? For me, safeguarding the lives of the citizens is far better achievement, which this administration has failed to do\u201d, Terhumba Tor, a senior lecturer at a federal university said.\n\nFor him, the principles of democracy and ideals of civil living are not upheld by the present administration and Nigerians are not expecting any positive change in the remaking two years of the present administration.\n\nOkwui Duruike, director, Centre for African Leadership Ideals, an Abuja-based African economy and politics research outfit, which has relocated to Cotonou in Benin Republic, noted that Nigerians should not expect miracle in the remaining two years of this administration as the country has been falling in development, human right and democracy indices in the last five years.\n\n\u201cWe have conducted several researches on development, good governance and security in collaboration with international agencies across 30 African countries. Nigeria is among the worst in Africa, while Ghana, Seychelles and Gaborone are leading across many fronts. The Nigerian case is lack of will power by government to tackle insecurity, enforce necessary actions, restore peace, woo back investors and boost the economy. Stability of a country and economic development go hand in hand but that will not happen in the remaining two years,\u201d Duruike said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn one of our reports on the worsening insecurity, we advised one of our foreign partners to inform the Nigerian government that all they needed was sincerity of purpose, boosting morale of its security operatives, fishing out sabotage, working with locals and collaboration with foreign governments.\u201d\n\nConsidering the huge damage done across the country due to the inaction of government, Tor thinks that two years will not be enough to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cWhere do you want to start, or what are you going to promise that has never been promised in the past. I don\u2019t expect any relief in the remaining two years of this administration because the thousands killed will not come back, houses burnt, farms destroyed and hopes dashed cannot be restored. I expect the worst in two years,\u201d Tor said.\n\nFor Bulus, the change we desire cannot come now or within the remaining two years because the recent actions of this administration point to a people that are running against time.\n\n\u201cThis is six years after taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who was regarded by many as a weakling. One former governor of Lagos State even said during campaign that a serious government will fix electricity issue in one year. So, they have been there for six years now and the trouble is quadrupling, so where is their magic wand?\u201d Bulus asked.\n\nOn his part, Ademola Fadahunsi, a political analyst, noted that though South West is clamoring to take over from President Buhari in 2023, the damage done so far is huge and will take almost the whole tenure of an incoming president to restore.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that we don\u2019t value human lives again. The killing is much, the country is soaked in blood and no matter how much infrastructure you put in place, you need living humans, peaceful country and stability for such infrastructure to be meaningful. They flagged off Lagos-Ibadan rail, but Abuja-Kaduna rail is besieged by bandits. Why not tackle insecurity first before investment that is already threatened by current realities in the country?\u201d Fadahunsi said.\n\nHowever, observers note that insecurity is the biggest issue in the country today and that every effort of this administration should be channeled to address it. Yet, they don\u2019t see any difference in the current situation within the remaining two years of this administration.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fool Nigerians by promising them a quick fix of insecurity in two years when since Jonathan\u2019s tenure, the country has been spending on security without result. We have witnessed change of security chiefs and increased budgets on security, yet no result. It will definitely get worse in the remaining two years of Buhari,\u201d Angwe Yakubu, a retired senior security personnel, said.\n\nSpeaking further, the Shamdam Plateau State-born retiree and now poultry farmer, said the fight against insecurity does not require huge spending on heavy armament, but will power and sincerity on the part of government, better treatment for soldiers, welfare for families of dead soldiers, empowerment of locals and collaboration with foreign countries to win.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to rhetoric that Boko Haram and bandits carry more sophisticated weapons. Can\u2019t such weapons be bought by Nigeria? All we need is sincerity of government to fight these terrorists, military to fight sabotage in its midst, locals to help with useful information and foreign partners to be given required information and free hand to work,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nAccording to him, this is the only way the remaining two years of this administration will make a difference, but he does not see them toeing the solution line.\n\nTunde Daramola, a politician, is not optimistic about a turnaround in the next two years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe ship of the state has been grounded by the present administration of Muhammadu Buhari. The first responsibility of a reasonable government is the security of lives and property. Presently, no Nigerian is safe; people are scared to go out and work or even travel. This APC- led government is a failure.\u201d\n\nAccording to Daramola, \u201cThe President is clueless on providing security for Nigerians not to talk of foreigners. No foreigner would come into Nigeria and invest with the level of insecurity today.\n\n\u201cNobody is happy and Nigerians are disappointed. It is a shame. I think the situation will get worse before 2023, or is it not getting even worse? Is the sign not there?\u201d\n\nBe believes that \u201cThis government appears overwhelmed with the situation; even the President confirmed it in the interview. I think these terrorists have some form of support, or how would you explain the situation now in the North where terrorists write letters to a community and come the same day to carry out an operation without any form of resistance?\n\n\u201cNigerians want this government to end today, not even tomorrow or 2023. Except for divine intervention, I don\u2019t see the situation improving. On the way forward, I am of the view that the President should urgently seek foreign help and intervention since he has admitted that the situation has overwhelmed him.\u201d\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a political analyst, said there was nothing more to expect from Buhari\u2019s remaining two years than what Nigerians have experienced in the last six years.\n\n\u201cThe government has lost touch with the people and they are even sinking deeper with their attempt to stifle media and social media. It is only when a government feels terribly defeated due to bad governance that they tend to clamp down on media and other forms of communication used by citizens to express their displeasure,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe level of insecurity is getting worse by the day, as you can see; another set of students has just been kidnapped in the Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is worrisome that people are now hired to welcome or protest in favour of Buhari; a truly performing government will not hire people; this goes to show that Buhari is not popular among Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is left for the government to review its actions and activities or continue to allow citizens to suffer, first time ever where Nigerians now buy yam pieces due to food inflation and increased poverty rate,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Is Nigerian Senate playing politics with PIB, Electoral Act and Constitutional Amendment?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the 9th Senate had a special session to celebrate its anniversary. The occasion afforded the senators the opportunity to sing their praises and what they said they have been able to achieve individually and collectively within the last two years.\n\nDespite being seen as a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 Senate, one acclaimed major achievement of the 9th Senate was the interventions in restoration of the national annual budget to the January-December cycle.\n\nAnalysts have said the measure has made the nation\u2019s fiscal plans more predictable and boosted the confidence of local and foreign investors in the economy.\n\nThe federal lawmakers also mentioned the passage of the Deep Off-Shore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act CAP D3 LFN 2004 (Amendment Bill, 2009). The senators passed the important law to increase Nigeria\u2019s share of revenue from its crude oil.\n\nFor ease of doing business, the Finance Bill 2019 (Nigeria Tax and Fiscal Law) (SB.140), which amended seven existing tax laws and Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C20 LFN 2004 (Repeal and Reenactment) Bill 2019 (SB.270) were also passed by the lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the current Senate headed by Ahmad Lawan has not gained the confidence of majority of Nigerians, who have continued to criticise the upper chamber and indeed the National Assembly of always doing the bidding of the executive, thus ignoring proper oversight and legislation.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from the frosty relationship that played out between the executive and legislative in the 8th Senate, President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had to ensure that someone loyal to the president and the ruling party emerged as the President of the Senate. So, the emergence of Senator Ahmad Lawan from Yobe North Senatorial District and Ovie Omo-Agege from Delta Central Senatorial District as president and deputy Senate president, respectively, was largely seen as mission accomplished.\n\nThe usual bickering commonly displayed by both arms of government and the rejection of Mr. President\u2019s nominees in the 8th Senate led by Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki has since been buried. Two years in the life of the current Senate, the relationship between the executive and legislature has been cordial.\n\nUnlike the 9th Senate, the 8th Senate always did their due diligence and oversight before passing anything from the executive, be it a bill or confirmation of a nominee(s). For instance, one case that stood out and has continued to be applauded by Nigerians was the rejection of Ibrahim Magu as the substantive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was rejected by the lawmakers on two different occasions based on a security report against his nominee from the State Security Service (SSS).\n\nSimilarly, the $30 billion loan request of the president to the 8th Senate was also rejected to save the country from sinking deeper into indebtedness. In his letter, Buhari explained that the amount was Federal Government\u2019s 2016 to 2018 external borrowing plan meant to execute key infrastructural projects cutting across all sectors with special emphasis on infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, water supply, growth and employment generation.\n\nBut the Senate Committee Chairman on Loan and Foreign Debt in the 8TH Senate, Shehu Sani, explained that they rejected the loan request from Muhammadu Buhari to save Nigeria from \u201csinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap.\u201d\n\nHe further argued that the lawmakers did not want the country to be re-colonised by creditor banks.\n\nUnfortunately, it is no longer the case under the current leadership as majority of the senators, especially in APC, are hitherto seen as willing tools in the hands of the President.\n\nAs a way of returning back the favour done to him,November 2019, expressedwillingness to approve all requests that come to the Senate from President Muhammadu Buhari when the Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, ItseSagay (SAN), paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja.\n\nHe quickly backed up the statement by saying that \u201cany request that comes from Buhari is good for the nation and the Senate will take immediate action on them.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cI want to assure you that any request that comes from Mr. President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place in terms of appointments or legislation and the Senate will act expeditiously to ensure that we play our part in the confirmation or passing of legislation appropriately.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it did not come as a surprise when the President\u2019s $30bn loan request was approved by the Lawan-led Senate. Additionally, in April 2021, the Senate approved the sum of $1.5bn and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the Federal Government.\n\nThe loans were part of the $5.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings Buhari had, in May 2020, asked the Red Chamber to approve to finance various priority projects of the Federal Government and to support the state governments facing fiscal challenges.\n\nAgain, the Senate on June 1, 2021 referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loan request to borrow N2.343 trillion from external source to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debt.\n\nBesides, on May 18, 2021, Buhari had sought the approval of the Senate to borrow a fresh N2.343 trillion ($6.18bn) external loan. The committee was subsequently mandated to look into the request of the President on Donor Fund Projects under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan and submit its report within two weeks.\n\nMore worrisome is the fact that the 9th Senate has not been able to pass the much-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) despite assurances of early passage.\n\nThe bill was passed into second reading in October 2020 and in January 2021, there was a public hearing on it where the President of the Senate said by May 2021, they would pass the bill. But sadly, that has not been the case. He has back-tracked to say that the PIB will now be passed by June 2021 as both committees in the upper and lower chambers are now writing the final report.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe National Assembly was to pass the PIB in May, however, there was need to put in place a legislative framework to further encourage foreign investments and development in the industry.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I think they (Joint Committee of the two chambers of the National Assembly on PIB) are about to start writing the report, which they will lay before the two chambers of the National Assembly, probably by the middle of June.\u201d\n\nIt is indeed a sad commentary that a bill of such nature, capable of entrenching transparency and accountability in the oil sector, has not been pass into law after about 20 years it was first. introduced.\n\nNonetheless, the Electoral Act Amendment bill is one bill Nigerians are calling the 9th Senate to also expedite action on in view of the 2023 general election. In fact, INEC, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), political parties, the media and other stakeholders have been voicing out, even protesting on the need to pass and sign the bill into law.\n\nAs violence and all manner of rigging have continued to blight the electoral process, the passage and signing of the bill into law now becomes imperative in view of the Anambra gubernatorial election coming up on November 6, 2021.\n\nLawan has again promised Nigerians that the Electoral Act Amendment bill and the Constitutional Amendment bill will the passed by mid July 2021 before going on recess.\n\nThe lawmakers are currently on a two-week break and will resume on June 22, 2021. Therefore, between June 22 and July 15, 2021 when they are expected to go on their summer break, the question is: can they pass these bills within 23 days?\n\nSpeaking on an interview session on Channels Television Sunrise Daily, Friday, June 18, 2021, AjibolaBashiru, Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, expressed the optimism that the PIB, Constitutional Amendment Bill and Electoral Act Bill would be passed before the legislators proceed on their summer break.\n\n\u201cI am particularly optimistic that we will meet the expectation of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 109 senators should bear in mind that history bacons on them at this critical time to always do the right thing by enacting and passing laws that would stand the text of time.\n\nIn their oversight function, they must carry out thorough screening and confirm only qualified nominees of Mr. President, and not all manner of persons sent to them just to please the Presidency.\n\nThey should serve Nigeria and Nigerians as their priority, not sycophantic allegiance to the President, to the detriment of the country.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Chief Pathologist of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), John Obafunwa, on Saturday submitted the autopsy documents of 99 deaths resulting from the #EndSARS protests in Lagos to the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry.\n\nMr Obafunwa, a professor of forensic pathology, was told to submit the autopsy reports at the last proceedings on June 6\n\nAccording to him, the 99 bodies, which include three killed at the Lekki Toll Gate during the shooting on October 20, 2020 by soldiers, were deposited at the morgue between October 19 and October 24, 2020.\n\nWhile giving evidence at the panel on Saturday, Mr Obafunwa, the head of the department of morbid anatomy at the Lagos State University College of Medicine, said the ethical practice, especially during a \u2018mass disaster\u2019 or \u201ca situation where all sorts of speculations arise\u201d, is to do an x-ray \u201cbefore you put a knife to a body.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to look for hidden fractures or prosthesis. It will help if such is discovered because it will be circumstantial evidence to make you say that this body belongs to this person.\n\n\u201cWe need to avoid sensationalism. If you look at a page in the report I submitted, all I did was to summarise. However, if I do an autopsy and I do not do radiography, you would tear me to pieces if I come to court with such a record. That is why I had to do everything, leaving nothing to chance.\u201d\n\nThe chair of the panel, Doris Okuwobi, ruled that the records presented be accepted as evidence and adjourned further hearing till June 26.\n\nSoldiers\u2019 shooting\n\nOn October 20 last year, soldiers opened fire at unarmed protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate killing yet-to-be-determined number of people.\n\nAlthough the army initially denied its soldiers shot at unarmed protesters, the multitude of evidence presented by witnesses, including videos showed that soldiers shot at protesters.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who initially said no one died from the shooting, later said only two persons died.\n\nSeveral protesters, including those who have appeared before the judicial panel to give evidence that many people were killed at the Lekki tollgate and many injured, have insisted that some of the corpses were taken away by the soldiers.",

          "title": "Revenue Drive Suffers Setback Over Obsolete Taxation Laws",
          "text": "Despite having more than 100 different taxes with less than 10 of them actually generating about 98 per cent of the country\u2019s tax revenue, indeed, there is need for Nigeria to review its tax laws, abolishing many that do not conform to current realities, tax practitioners told LEADERSHIP yesterday.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of such that was canvassed for by the analysts is the stamp duty act which was introduced into the country by the British in the 1890s and was made into law in 1939.\n\nAccording to the tax practitioners, while the government is looking at introducing more taxes to generate revenue, there is need for a review of the tax laws, more accountability on the part of the government and an overhaul of general tax administration in the country.\n\nThe practitioners believe that with this, the nation\u2019s tax law would be compliant with current realities, more effective and generate the much needed revenue for the country.\n\nData from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria increased by 0.6 percentage points from 5.7 per cent in 2017 to 6.3 per cent in 2018. In comparison, the average for 30 African countries increased by just under 0.1 percentage points over the same period, and was 16.5 per cent in 2018.\n\nSince 2010, the average for the 30 African countries has increased by 1.4 percentage points, from 15.1 per cent in 2010 to 16.5 per cent in 2018. Over the same period, the tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria has decreased by 1.0 percentage points, from 7.3 per cent to 6.3 per cent. The highest tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria was 9.6 per cent in 2011, with the lowest being 5.3 per cent in 2016.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) said it pulled in N4.952 trillion in non-oil revenue, lower than N5.076 trillion which it projected to make in the year and much lower than N5.261 trillion it made in the same period of 2019.\n\nThe FIRS, like in years past, had fallen short of its N8.802 trillion projections in 2019. Between 2015 and 2018, the country had recorded N16.395 trillion revenue as against N20.408 trillion that was projected during the period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Nigeria\u2019s non-oil revenue mobilization has been one of the lowest worldwide, reflecting weaknesses in revenue administration systems and systemic noncompliance.\n\n\u201cFor corporate income tax, less than six percent of registered taxpayers are active. Estimates on payment compliance in the case of value added tax (VAT) vary between 15 and 40 percent, and Nigeria raises less than one percent of GDP in VAT revenue, compared to almost four percent of GDP in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Tax exemptions and incentives are narrowing the base.\n\n\u201cInternational evidence shows that a minimum tax-to-GDP ratio of 12.75 percent is associated with a significant acceleration in growth and development of state capacity. It would allow increased expenditure for economic development and reduce budget exposure to oil revenue volatility,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP, Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PwC, Taiwo Oyedele, noted that tax morale is low in Nigeria because \u201cpeople don\u2019t trust the government as transparency and accountability are very poor. This combination, unfortunately, means Nigeria is unable to generate enough revenues to take care of governance and the people.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there are three major factors that hinder effective taxation in Nigeria. He listed legislation, administration and policy.\n\nOn tax administration, Oyedele of PwC noted that the administration of taxation in Nigeria hasn\u2019t impacted revenue growth in the economy. He said, \u201cWe find a lot of things done manually paying taxes, filling forms, filing returns are cumbersome and a lot of untrained people who are collecting taxes, harassing business owners and a whole lot of others. Some of those taxes end up in private pockets and because they are being collected in very manual, crude and unrefined ways gives way to corruption.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on legislation, Oyedele said, \u201cOur laws are obsolete in many cases, it is just too ambiguous and complicated for those doing business in today\u2019s world. There are many tax laws we inherited from the British laws before our independence, and we haven\u2019t done much to improve them since then.\n\n\u201cTo think about the stamp duty law of 1939 or thereabout long before our independence and apart from changing pounds to naira and kobo, there hasn\u2019t been any major improvement. If you think about the personal income tax, there used to be a time when it was exempted for poor people and that was people earning N30,000 per annum and that is N2,500 per month, but that is completely ridiculous because no one earns N2,500 per month now. So, because we haven\u2019t been doing reviews of our laws, they are very much out of date.\u201d\n\nIn addressing this, Oyedele said apart from simplifying the tax law, \u201cwe need to repeal so many of them, harmonise them so that we have fewer laws. That way, we do not have over 100 different taxes when indeed more than 98 per cent of revenue comes from less than 10. Why don\u2019t we repeal all those taxes that create troubles for everyone and interpret the tax laws into the main languages Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo in addition to pidgin and then simplify them? We have a law of 1939 which was before I was born which means it is very old, that means we are trying to tax transactions now that never existed at that time. We didn\u2019t even have the internet then and now we are trying to impose stamp duties on money transfers. Electronic money transfer wasn\u2019t in existence when this law was made so we are now trying to force a square peg into a round hole. There would be a lot of scars.\n\nOyedele also listed policy as a hindrance to effective taxation in Nigeria. According to him, the policy direction in different areas of tax collection sometimes are unclear, inconsistent and sometimes they are not well harmonised between the levels of government. He said, \u201cThat is why we see a lot of multiple taxation everywhere which affect particularly Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), some of them are taxed to death. There is also the problem of overregulation.\n\n\u2018\u2018The starting point of what Nigeria needs to do is to look at the tax policy framework. The National Tax Policy of 2017 hasn\u2019t been implemented and now it is due for review. The government needs to review that, look at what it is that we want, who do you want to tax, how do you want to tax them, who should bear the incidence. So that shows the kind of tax system that needs to happen and I hope it can start with the tax recommendation sent to the National Assembly as part of the constitution review. In the area of administration we need to use a lot of intelligence, data and technology, a lot of what we do manually today is making our cost of collection to be extremely high.\u201d\n\nAlso, the immediate past president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), Dame Jumoke Simplice, called for a review of the tax laws in the country.\n\nAccording to her, there is need for political autonomy as well as capacity building for revenue collecting staff. She suggested that qualified tax practitioners be employed into the tax system to ensure effective collection, rather than using political affiliations to appoint tax officers.\n\nSimplice also explained that the level of corruption in the system discourages the citizens from paying taxes. \u201cPeople get disenchanted when they see in the news that government officials are stealing billions of naira and there is no real consequence because no one has been jailed. So, it will not encourage voluntary compliance. We cannot continue to pay lip service to anti-corruption and then do plea bargaining with corrupt persons, it does not work. People will be discouraged when government takes so much and people can\u2019t see what the money is being used for,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "Despite having more than 100 different taxes with less than 10 of them actually generating about 98 per cent of the country\u2019s tax revenue, indeed, there is need for Nigeria to review its tax laws, abolishing many that do not conform to current realities, tax practitioners told LEADERSHIP yesterday.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of such that was canvassed for by the analysts is the stamp duty act which was introduced into the country by the British in the 1890s and was made into law in 1939.\n\nAccording to the tax practitioners, while the government is looking at introducing more taxes to generate revenue, there is need for a review of the tax laws, more accountability on the part of the government and an overhaul of general tax administration in the country.\n\nThe practitioners believe that with this, the nation\u2019s tax law would be compliant with current realities, more effective and generate the much needed revenue for the country.\n\nData from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria increased by 0.6 percentage points from 5.7 per cent in 2017 to 6.3 per cent in 2018. In comparison, the average for 30 African countries increased by just under 0.1 percentage points over the same period, and was 16.5 per cent in 2018.\n\nSince 2010, the average for the 30 African countries has increased by 1.4 percentage points, from 15.1 per cent in 2010 to 16.5 per cent in 2018. Over the same period, the tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria has decreased by 1.0 percentage points, from 7.3 per cent to 6.3 per cent. The highest tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria was 9.6 per cent in 2011, with the lowest being 5.3 per cent in 2016.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nIn 2020, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) said it pulled in N4.952 trillion in non-oil revenue, lower than N5.076 trillion which it projected to make in the year and much lower than N5.261 trillion it made in the same period of 2019.\n\nThe FIRS, like in years past, had fallen short of its N8.802 trillion projections in 2019. Between 2015 and 2018, the country had recorded N16.395 trillion revenue as against N20.408 trillion that was projected during the period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Nigeria\u2019s non-oil revenue mobilization has been one of the lowest worldwide, reflecting weaknesses in revenue administration systems and systemic noncompliance.\n\n\u201cFor corporate income tax, less than six percent of registered taxpayers are active. Estimates on payment compliance in the case of value added tax (VAT) vary between 15 and 40 percent, and Nigeria raises less than one percent of GDP in VAT revenue, compared to almost four percent of GDP in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Tax exemptions and incentives are narrowing the base.\n\n\u201cInternational evidence shows that a minimum tax-to-GDP ratio of 12.75 percent is associated with a significant acceleration in growth and development of state capacity. It would allow increased expenditure for economic development and reduce budget exposure to oil revenue volatility,\u201d the IMF said.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP, Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PwC, Taiwo Oyedele, noted that tax morale is low in Nigeria because \u201cpeople don\u2019t trust the government as transparency and accountability are very poor. This combination, unfortunately, means Nigeria is unable to generate enough revenues to take care of governance and the people.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there are three major factors that hinder effective taxation in Nigeria. He listed legislation, administration and policy.\n\nOn tax administration, Oyedele of PwC noted that the administration of taxation in Nigeria hasn\u2019t impacted revenue growth in the economy. He said, \u201cWe find a lot of things done manually paying taxes, filling forms, filing returns are cumbersome and a lot of untrained people who are collecting taxes, harassing business owners and a whole lot of others. Some of those taxes end up in private pockets and because they are being collected in very manual, crude and unrefined ways gives way to corruption.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on legislation, Oyedele said, \u201cOur laws are obsolete in many cases, it is just too ambiguous and complicated for those doing business in today\u2019s world. There are many tax laws we inherited from the British laws before our independence, and we haven\u2019t done much to improve them since then.\n\n\u201cTo think about the stamp duty law of 1939 or thereabout long before our independence and apart from changing pounds to naira and kobo, there hasn\u2019t been any major improvement. If you think about the personal income tax, there used to be a time when it was exempted for poor people and that was people earning N30,000 per annum and that is N2,500 per month, but that is completely ridiculous because no one earns N2,500 per month now. So, because we haven\u2019t been doing reviews of our laws, they are very much out of date.\u201d\n\nIn addressing this, Oyedele said apart from simplifying the tax law, \u201cwe need to repeal so many of them, harmonise them so that we have fewer laws. That way, we do not have over 100 different taxes when indeed more than 98 per cent of revenue comes from less than 10. Why don\u2019t we repeal all those taxes that create troubles for everyone and interpret the tax laws into the main languages Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo in addition to pidgin and then simplify them? We have a law of 1939 which was before I was born which means it is very old, that means we are trying to tax transactions now that never existed at that time. We didn\u2019t even have the internet then and now we are trying to impose stamp duties on money transfers. Electronic money transfer wasn\u2019t in existence when this law was made so we are now trying to force a square peg into a round hole. There would be a lot of scars.\n\nOyedele also listed policy as a hindrance to effective taxation in Nigeria. According to him, the policy direction in different areas of tax collection sometimes are unclear, inconsistent and sometimes they are not well harmonised between the levels of government. He said, \u201cThat is why we see a lot of multiple taxation everywhere which affect particularly Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), some of them are taxed to death. There is also the problem of overregulation.\n\n\u2018\u2018The starting point of what Nigeria needs to do is to look at the tax policy framework. The National Tax Policy of 2017 hasn\u2019t been implemented and now it is due for review. The government needs to review that, look at what it is that we want, who do you want to tax, how do you want to tax them, who should bear the incidence. So that shows the kind of tax system that needs to happen and I hope it can start with the tax recommendation sent to the National Assembly as part of the constitution review. In the area of administration we need to use a lot of intelligence, data and technology, a lot of what we do manually today is making our cost of collection to be extremely high.\u201d\n\nAlso, the immediate past president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), Dame Jumoke Simplice, called for a review of the tax laws in the country.\n\nAccording to her, there is need for political autonomy as well as capacity building for revenue collecting staff. She suggested that qualified tax practitioners be employed into the tax system to ensure effective collection, rather than using political affiliations to appoint tax officers.\n\nSimplice also explained that the level of corruption in the system discourages the citizens from paying taxes. \u201cPeople get disenchanted when they see in the news that government officials are stealing billions of naira and there is no real consequence because no one has been jailed. So, it will not encourage voluntary compliance. We cannot continue to pay lip service to anti-corruption and then do plea bargaining with corrupt persons, it does not work. People will be discouraged when government takes so much and people can\u2019t see what the money is being used for,\u201d she said.",

It was in that process that they shot him from the rear. When he fell down, the bandits put him in their vehicle to go with him. But they saw blood gushing out of his body and decided to drop him. They pushed him down.\n\n\u201cHe is getting better, he is in the hands of people with the doctors, because of the blood coming out, one teacher quickly carried him and ran away with him,\u201d she said.\n\nA source told the BBC Hausa that three students have died so far, 2 females and a male.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAccording to the report, one of the female students was asthmatic, as her father had said but the male student died from gunshots.\n\nThe report said the bandits sacked about five villages in Anka and Bukuyum communities of Zamfara State.\n\nAccording to the report, about 29 locals were killed by the bandits who rustled their livestock and stole farm produce, leading to mass exodus from the communities.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbubakar Mai Inji, a resident of Tungan Rogo who has since moved to another area, said the bandits chased out residents of five villages in Bukuyum and Anka axis.\n\n\u201cThe places have been deserted; we\u2019ve been in a state of fear and confusion. We are now in Nasarawa, no food, we are hungry.

          "title": "Child Labour: The Cankerworm Depriving Nigeria Of Her Future",
          "text": "As Nigeria joins the world to celebrate the World Day Against Child Labour (WDACL) LEADERSHIP Weekend reveals the travails of children between the ages of 5-16 years who battle for survival in Nigeria, peddling vegetables, sachet water, groundnut, bread and other consumables, with some even experiencing harassment, sexual abuse and cheating.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nMarked on June 12 each year, the World Day Against Child Labour was launched in 2002 by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations body that regulates the world of work, to bring attention and join efforts to fight against child labour.\n\nChild labour is a global issue of international and local concern. In respect of Nigeria, it had been observed that over 15 million children aged 5 \u2013 14 years are engaged in child labour. On the other hand, child labour means any work that deprives a child of its childhood and right to education or is detrimental to the physical, mental, moral and social well-being of the child.\n\nAccordingly, a work amounts to child labour if it is exploitative and/or injurious to any aspect of the developing personality of the child. In order to determine when a child is involved in child labour, the United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) provided a list of indices to be considered to wit: Depriving children of their rights to education where schools are available or interfering with their education; Participating in work that results in excessive physical, social and psychological strains on the child;Work that does not facilitate the psychological development of the child amongst others.\n\nHowever, child labour is not the same thing as \u201clight work\u201d done by children. Light work includes domestic chores such as washing of utensils, cloths, supervised training and artistic undertakings. In all these, the age of the child should be the paramount consideration.\n\nA teenager, who gave his name as Peter Ogbonna told LEADERSHIP Weekend that , \u201cI was born into a family of seven. My parents are poor and cannot afford to send us to school so I resorted to hawking groundnut/cashew nuts in order to support them take care of my siblings. I make up to N4,500 on a daily basis that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult for me to quit this business.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThis is just one out of thousands and one chilling stories about many children involved in child labour in some parts of Nigeria that will send shivers down your spine.\n\nWhile the working condition of child labourers can be sub-human, some of them are forced to work more than 12 hours a day. Some child prostitutes are forced to participate in sexual acts that permanently ruin their innocence. Most of them are paid a pittance for the long hours of work. One cannot imagine our own children going through the same plight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDisturbingly, children in Nigeria engage in the worst forms of child labour, including in quarrying granite, artisanal mining, commercial sexual exploitation, and armed conflict.\n\nThis year\u2019s World Day Against Child Labour focuses on action taken for the 2021 International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour. It is the first World Day since the universal ratification of the ILO\u2019s Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, and takes place at time when the COVID-19 crisis threatens to reverse years of progress in tackling the problem.\n\nSadly, the Child\u2019s Right Act has only been adopted by 25 out of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states, leaving the remaining 11 states in northern Nigeria with legal statutes that do not meet international standards for the prohibition of child trafficking, commercial sexual exploitation, and illicit activities.\n\nIn addition, the minimum age for work in the Labour Act does not apply to children who are self-employed or working in the informal economy, which does not conform to international standards that require all children to be protected by the minimum age to work.\n\nIn northern Nigeria, many families send children from rural to urban areas to live with Islamic teachers and receive a Koranic education. These children may receive lessons, but teachers often force them to beg on the streets and surrender the money they collect.\n\nBenin City, the capital of Edo state, is a major human trafficking hub in Africa, but increased enforcement efforts may have caused some human trafficking rings to shift their focus to other areas of southern Nigeria. Here, teenage girls from Nigeria are sent to North Africa and Europe for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation.\n\nAchild Rights Activists Mrs Ekuma Ekpekpe who appealed to NAPTIP to scale up surveillance lamented that despite the high level of awareness and advocacy to enhance the understanding of stakeholders on the inherent dangers of child labour, some few unpatriotic employers are still engaging the services of children in work places like cocoa and palm plantations, quarries and other hazardous places.\u201d\n\nShe expressed bitterness that although free and compulsory education is federally mandated by the Education Act, little enforcement of compulsory education laws occurs at the state level. When families experienced economic hardship, the enrollment of boys becomes typically prioritised over the enrollment of girls.\n\nSpeaking on the travail of victims of Child Labour, Barrister Doris Edum blamed Poverty as undoubtedly the predominant cause of child labour around the world. She said, \u201cChildren of impoverished households and parents who have no means of subsistence are most likely to engage in child labour in order to survive.\n\nDr Usman Fatima said the trend on the lack of family planning which enable parents to give birth to the number of children they can adequately cater for. However, where uninformed parents fail to take advantage of available family planning methods, the consequence generally is an over blotted family size well beyond the means of such parents.\n\nShe also blamed the increase in the number of child labourers on the divorce of couples and remarriage by one of them , a development she said often often traumatises children who are in most cases maltreated and neglected by their step father or mother.\n\nIt is worth emphasising for the umpteenth time that childhood is the right of every child, regardless of race, culture, religion or creed. This is the period that a child acquires the basic knowledge about life from parents, family and the environment.\u201d\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend warns that interfering with this part of children\u2019s lives could create an imbalance in their growth and development, and implores the state Houses of Assembly who had yet to pass the Child Rights Act to do so in order to put an end to the menace.\n\nMeanwhile, a new report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and UNICEF have revealed that the number of children in child labour has risen to 160 million worldwide \u2013 an increase of 8.4 million children in the last four years \u2013 with millions more at risk due to the impacts of COVID-19\n\nThe report which was released ahead of World Day Against Child Labour on June 12, warns that progress to end child labour has stalled for the first time in 20 years, reversing the previous downward trend that saw child labour fall by 94 million between 2000 and 2016.\n\nThe report points to a significant rise in the number of children aged 5 to 11 years in child labour, who now account for just over half of the total global figure. The number of children aged 5 to 17 years in hazardous work \u2013 defined as work that is likely to harm their health, safety or morals \u2013 has risen by 6.5 million to 79 million since 2016.\n\nThe report signed by ILO director-general, Guy Ryder said, \u2018\u201cThe new estimates are a wake-up call. We cannot stand by while a new generation of children is put at risk. We are at a pivotal moment and much depends on how we respond. This is a time for renewed commitment and energy, to turn the corner and break the cycle of poverty and child labour.\n\nThe report warns that globally, nine million additional children are at risk of being pushed into child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the pandemic. A simulation model shows this number could rise to 46 million if they don\u2019t have access to critical social protection coverage.\n\n\u201cWe are losing ground in the fight against child labour, and the last year has not made that fight any easier,\u201d said UNICEF executive director, Henrietta Fore. \u201cNow, well into a second year of global lockdowns, school closures, economic disruptions, and shrinking national budgets, families are forced to make heart-breaking choices. We urge governments and international development banks to prioritise investments in programmes that can get children out of the workforce and back into school, and in social protection programmes that can help families avoid making this choice in the first place",
          "summary": "In respect of Nigeria, it had been observed that over 15 million children aged 5 \u2013 14 years are engaged in child labour.\nAccordingly, a work amounts to child labour if it is exploitative and/or injurious to any aspect of the developing personality of the child.\nThis year\u2019s World Day Against Child Labour focuses on action taken for the 2021 International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour.\nSpeaking on the travail of victims of Child Labour, Barrister Doris Edum blamed Poverty as undoubtedly the predominant cause of child labour around the world.\nThis is a time for renewed commitment and energy, to turn the corner and break the cycle of poverty and child labour.",

          "text": "In spite of the overwhelming outcry against the plan to retrace and recover grazing routes across the country, the Federal Government is not showing signs of relenting.\n\nSaturday PUNCH findings revealed that stock routes, popularly called grazing routes, are currently being retraced and recovered by the Federal Government for herders to graze their cattle.\n\nThe Federal Government said this was meant to address the clashes between herdsmen and farmers.\n\nAlthough some of the routes are believed to have been encroached upon due to human activities, Saturday PUNCH found out that the government had embarked on a process of identifying monuments along the routes in order to get them back as locations for cattle grazing.\n\nContrary to the expectations of many Nigerians particularly in South that the grazing routes retracing and eventual recovery might not see the light of day, officials of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development told one of our correspondents on Friday that the routes\u2019 recovery would go on.\n\nThey, however, said it would be done mainly in non-conflict zones.\n\nThey also stated that routes that had been encroached upon as a result of the development of public infrastructure might be left out of the recovery exercise.\n\nThe acting Director, Animal Husbandry Department, FMARD, Winnie Lai-Solarin, stated that while cattle ranching had been one of the major options canvassed for herders, not every pastoralist would be able to afford ranching at the moment.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere are some stock routes that we have across the country, and in the past, we had monuments along these stock routes, particularly the primary stock routes.\n\n\u201cAnd in the course of farming or other human activities along those stock routes, the monuments were altered, but we know where they are. So we are saying that some of them can be retraced.\n\n\u201cAnd this is particularly for areas that are not encroached upon as of now. The pastoralists know the routes, and on some of those routes, you will see the pieces of the monuments along them.\u201d\n\nLai-Solarin added, \u201cSo for those that are not encroached upon and are not in conflict zones, we will go ahead to retrace and guide the pastoralists along them. We didn\u2019t get to where we are today in one day and so we cannot expect that every pastoralist should suddenly start ranching now.\n\n\u201cSome would still have to move but let\u2019s keep the movement as safe as possible and in areas that are not conflict zones. That is what I am saying. We are not going to retrace stock routes where there are infrastructures that are for the public good.\u201d\n\nAnother official at the FMARD familiar with the development stated that the government was not happy with the killings associated with clashes between herdsmen and farmers.\n\nThe official, who requested not to be named for lack of authorisation, explained that the stock routes were in three classes.\n\nThe source said, \u201cWe need to create safe places that are easy for them (herders) to graze their cattle so that they won\u2019t need to travel on the roads. We have primary and secondary stock routes and in some cases, we have tertiary stock routes.\u201d\n\nProviding further explanation on the three classes of routes, the official said, \u201cThe primary stock routes are the major routes that run in a North-to-South direction from the Sahel to the coastal market.\n\n\u201cAnd then, there are some major routes that run inter-state from the North, while others run intra-state.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, had announced on Thursday that the Federal Capital Territory and 22 states had registered for the National Livestock Transformation Plan as part of measures to establish grazing reserves in their domains.\n\nHe also announced that seven of these states had earmarked 400,000 hectares of land for the initiative, as the establishment of grazing reserves were currently ongoing in Nasarawa, Borno, Niger, Kaduna and some other states.\n\n\u201cTwenty-two states and the Federal Capital Territory have registered with the NLTP office, out of which 10 states have created their own teams which have been trained by the federal office,\u201d Nanono stated.

          "text": "By Ibrahim Bello\n\nKebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, has vowed to lead hunters and vigilantes in the battlefield against bandits ravaging the state.\n\nHe also joined his counterpart in Ekiti, Dr. Kayode Fayemi to charged the hunters and vigilantes to be ready to defend the territories of states against frequent attacks by bandits.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governors stated this on Saturday in Birnin Kebbi while addressing hundreds of local hunters and vigilance groups from different parts of the state.\n\nThe groups had converged on the state capital to declare their readiness to wage war against bandits.\n\nBagudu, in an emotion laden-voice, told the hunters that he and other governors were ready to be on the battle fields to defend the lives of the people, their property and territories of the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are not military yet and we are not police. We commend and respect what the security agencies for what they are doing and they are doing a great job; but, sometimes, remember security agents are human beings.\n\n\u201cThey also want the community support; they want the support from the vigilantes. So, if we can go to electioneering campaign rallies and gather 100,000 people, what has taken place in Birnin Yauri should be the last strike.\n\n\u201cWe should follow these bandits wherever they are and deal with them all. And I call on all my colleagues in other states too, to do same. How many are they (bandits)? How many of us can they kill?\n\n\u201cSo, we will discuss with the security agencies so that we don\u2019t interfere in the commendable jobs they are doing. But we will go out there, like I promised you; on the day we move out, I will not be in office; I will join you in the field.\n\n\u201cAnd I am sure other governors will be leading their people so that we can all meet in the fields. It is not the weapons that win the war, it is the will of the people. Bad people cannot trample upon the will of good people, and we will show them that we have the will power,\u201d he charged.\n\nBagudu also commended President Muhammadu Buhari and security agencies for doing their best with limited resources, stressing the need for the people to mobilise themselves and take on the bandits.\n\n\u201cYes, we are afraid of death; nobody wants to die. But who will not die? We are afraid not to be hurt, but who will not be hurt?\n\n\u201cWhich one is more tragic? To die like a coward. I think that should be the greatest fear; or to die without faith?\n\n\u201cBecause, as the people of faiths, we know that our Scriptures, both Christians and Muslims, especially Muslims, Islam teaches us to put our lives at risk in defending our honours, or our property or our faith.\n\n\u201cIn all what these bandits are doing to us, they have challenged our faiths, our property and our honours and we can\u2019t allow them to go.\n\n\u201cSo, go back to your communities and mobilise your people because I will get clearance from the security and we will meet them on the field,\u201d the governor urged.\n\nIn his remarks, Fayemi, who is also Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), charged the hunters and people of the state to use all power within their possession to end bandits attack in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur governor (Bagudu) has put on a good fight. That is the demonstration of his commitment to the welfare of his people.\n\n\u201cWe know, we would overcome these challenges. There are lessons from it, for our own states too; where we have Federal Government Colleges, and we have ordinary schools belonging to the state.\n\n\u201cAnd we must protect our children, we must protect our people because our first job as the governors is the security and welfare of our people.\n\n\u201cGod Almighty will be with us to realise the objective of protecting our people, in sha Allahu,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Jigawa Gov. Abubakar Badaru, who also accompanied Fayemi, charged the local hunters to use all power within their possession to rescue and defeat bandits terrorising the state.",

In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions which will positively impact our citizens,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu.\n\nPresident Buhari added, \u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want.\n\n\u201cPressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is unfortunately under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: South East Governors Condemn Violent Secessionist Groups, Back United Nigeria\n\nThe Nigerian leader, therefore, appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as being \u2018clearly under siege\u2019.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, the President cautioned them not to perpetuate acts that would facilitate the destabilisation and destruction of Mali.\n\n\u201cI urge our organization to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute Mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly, for his untiring efforts thus far.\n\n\u201cI encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Libya, President Buhari faulted the recent United Nations Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya, without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe lamented that while the decision was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders has created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region.\n\nThe President warned that this could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the Nigerian leader at the Summit also addressed other pertinent issues of concern in the organisation, including the ongoing institutional reforms in ECOWAS.\n\nDeclaring Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reforms process, he said he looked forward to an ECOWAS that would be \u2018fit for purpose\u2019, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nHe commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nIn his capacity as the ECOWAS champion on the fight against COVID-19, President Buhari also drew attention to the need for more citizens in the region to be vaccinated, stressing the need for adherence to other non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nHe said the West African region was in the grip of a third wave, warning against complacency in national and regional initiatives to address the pandemic.\n\nPresident Buhari reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the noble objectives of the organisation, saying, \u201cI encourage us to take bolder steps towards ensuring that the organisation fulfils the aspirations of its founding fathers, which include a truly integrated sub-region, economically, politically, socio-culturally united and secured to permit its sustainable development and growth.\u201d",

          "text": "Israel has said the international community should have grave concerns about the election of Iran\u2019s new president-elect, Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nA spokesman for Israel\u2019s foreign ministry, Lior Haiat, said Mr Raisi is Iran\u2019s most extremist president yet. He also warned the new leader will increase Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\n\nEbrahim Raisi was declared the winner of Iran\u2019s presidential election on Saturday, in a race that was widely seen as being designed to favour him.\n\nMr Raisi, who will be inaugurated in August, is Iran\u2019s top judge and holds ultra-conservative views. He is under US sanctions and has been linked to past executions of political prisoners.\n\nIn a statement following his victory, he promised to strengthen public trust in the government, and be a leader for the entire nation.\n\n\u201cI will form a hard-working, revolutionary and anti-corruption government,\u201d state media quoted him as saying.\n\nHowever in a critical Twitter thread, Israel\u2019s Lior Haiat said he is \u201can extremist figure, committed to Iran\u2019s rapidly advancing military nuclear program\u201d.\n\nIran and Israel have been in a long-running \u201cshadow war\u201d, which has resulted in both countries taking part in tit-for-tat actions, but so far avoiding all-out conflict. Recently, however, the hostilities between the two have escalated again.\n\nThe situation is complex, but one big source of tension is Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\n\nIran blames Israel for the murder of its top nuclear scientist last year and an attack on one of its uranium enrichment plants in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel does not believe that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is purely peaceful, and is convinced it is working towards building a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which saw harsh penalties lifted on Iran as long as it stopped some nuclear work, collapsed when former US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, and re-imposed the crippling economic sanctions. The Biden administration is now trying to work out a way to re-enter the deal.\n\nIn response to the sanctions being tightened, Iran stepped up its nuclear activities, and is currently enriching uranium at its highest levels ever \u2013 although still short of what is needed to make nuclear-grade weapons.\n\nCommenting on the election result, the US said it regretted Iranians were \u201cdenied their right to choose their own leaders in a free and fair electoral process\u201d.\n\nVoter turnout was at a record low for this election, with less than 50% of registered voters going to the polls, compared to more than 70% in 2017. Many people shunned the election, believing that it had been engineered in favour of Mr Raisi, who is a staunch ally of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nMr Raisi\u2019s win has come on the same weekend as negotiations to try and save the Iran nuclear deal continue in Vienna.\n\nThe EU has said another formal meeting will take place on Sunday between Iran and the six world powers involved in the deal. This is the sixth round of indirect talks between the US and Iran, and this week officials said the parties remain divided on some key issues, Reuters reported.\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Lior Haiat called Mr Raisi the \u201cbutcher of Tehran\u201d, in reference to the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.\n\nMr Raisi was one of four judges, who became known as the \u201cdeath committee\u201d, which allegedly sentenced about 5,000 men and women to death, Amnesty International says. In his tweets, however, Mr Haiat said more than 30,000 people were killed, which is a number also referenced by Iranian human rights groups.\n\nRussia\u2019s Vladimir Putin was quick to congratulate Ebrahim Raisi, highlighting the \u201ctraditionally friendly and good-neighbourly\u201d relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe leaders of Syria, Iraq, Turkey and the UAE sent similar messages of support and congratulations.\n\nA spokesperson for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, wished Iran \u201cprogress and prosperity\u201d.\n\nHowever, human rights groups have said Mr Raisi should be investigated for atrocities.\n\n\u201cAs head of Iran\u2019s repressive judiciary, Raisi oversaw some of the most heinous crimes in Iran\u2019s recent history, which deserve investigation and accountability rather than election to high office,\u201d Michael Page from Human Rights Watch said.",

          "text": "Wales are within touching distance of the Euro 2020 knockout stage as they visit Rome for their final group game against an Italy side in ominous form.\n\nItaly are unbeaten in 29 matches, winning their previous 10 without conceding a single goal.\n\nThey are already through to the last 16 having won their first two games, while Wales have all but guaranteed their passage with four points so far.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big challenge,\u201d said Wales captain Gareth Bale. \u201cEven if that record wasn\u2019t there, Italy are a big footballing nation and always make games difficult.\n\n\u201cIt would be a great result if we could win. Our aim is to win the game \u2013 none of us ever go into a match to get a draw. We have a gameplan which we think can hurt them.\u201d\n\nHaving drawn with Switzerland and beaten Turkey, if Wales draw in Rome they will finish second in Group A and play a second-round match in Amsterdam against Group B\u2019s runners-up.\n\nEven if they lose, Wales could still finish second. But if they lose and Switzerland beat Turkey \u2013 with a significant swing in goal difference in the process \u2013 Robert Page\u2019s side could finish third. However, four points would still almost certainly be enough to see them through to the last 16 as one of the tournament\u2019s four best third-placed teams.\n\nBut if Wales inflict on Italy a first competitive home loss since 1999, they would win the group and play their next game at Wembley against Group C\u2019s runners-up.\n\nWith only hundreds of Wales fans able to attend their matches in Rome and Baku so far, a trip to Wembley could see the Red Wall return in their thousands.\n\n\u201cI think for the Welsh fans to be able to come and watch us is definitely something we would love to see,\u201d said Bale.\n\nItaly manager Roberto Mancini said: \u201cWales are a very difficult team to face because they\u2019ve been right up there in the Fifa world rankings for a number of years. That shows they have quality players.\n\n\u201cThey are a British team and have a lot of physicality.\u201d\n\nWhen Mancini was asked if that physicality reminded him of playing against Stoke City when he was Manchester City manager, he laughed and said: \u201cStoke was a tricky place to go to.\n\n\u201cStoke had a very tough style of play, they were a very tough nut to crack.\n\n\u201cBut Wales have players like [Joe] Allen, Bale, [Daniel] James \u2013 skilful, quality players so it will be a difficult match from a physical perspective. Wales are not only technical, but powerful on the physical side.\u201d\n\nWhen Bale was asked about the comparison, he said: \u201cI never knew Stoke were that good!\u201d\n\nWales and Italy in particular are expected to make changes for their meeting in Rome.\n\nPage has hinted he might manage the workload of some players who were fitness concerns in the build-up to the tournament, such as midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen.\n\nDefenders Chris Mepham and Ben Davies and striker Kieffer Moore have all received yellow cards at Euro 2020, one away from a suspension.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the difficulty. We\u2019ve been here before in the semi-finals in 2016 and missed influential players [Ramsey and Davies] and it\u2019s affected them until today,\u201d said Page.\n\n\u201cOf course that\u2019s going to be part of the thought process but, more importantly, we\u2019re playing against a very good Italian side.\n\n\u201cWe have to take that into consideration. A team will be selected that we believe can win the game.\u201d\n\nWith Italy\u2019s place in the second round already guaranteed, Mancini is reportedly considering making as many as five or six changes.\n\nCaptain Giorgio Chiellini is out injured, so Lazio\u2019s Francesco Acerbi is expected to take his place in central defence. Chiellini\u2019s injury is not thought to be serious and he should be fit for Italy\u2019s last 16 tie next Saturday.\n\nParis St-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti is expected to return, while Chelsea\u2019s Emerson Palmieri could start if left-back Leonardo Spinazzola is rested.\n\nMancini could also recall forwards Andrea Belotti and Federico Chiesa in order to give the likes of Ciro Immobile a rest.\n\nThis is the first match between Italy and Wales at a major tournament. The Azzurri have won seven of the nine meetings, with Wales winning the other two.\n\nThe most recent encounter was a European Championship qualifier in Milan in 2003, which the hosts won 4-0. Robert Page started for Wales as Filippo Inzaghi scored an 11-minute hat-trick.\n\nItaly are unbeaten in their past 29 games. If they avoid defeat, they will equal their all-time longest unbeaten run of 30 games between 1935 and 1939.\n\nThey have gone 965 minutes without conceding a goal. If Wales avoid defeat, they will have made it out of the group stage in all three of their appearances at a major tournament, having also done so at the 1958 World Cup and Euro 2016.\n\nWales have lost just one of their past 15 competitive games, March\u2019s 3-1 defeat by Belgium in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nAaron Ramsey has been involved in six of the 13 goals Wales have scored at European Championships, scoring two and assisting four.",
          "summary": "Wales are within touching distance of the Euro 2020 knockout stage as they visit Rome for their final group game against an Italy side in ominous form.\n\u201cEven if that record wasn\u2019t there, Italy are a big footballing nation and always make games difficult.\n\u201cBut Wales have players like [Joe] Allen, Bale, [Daniel] James \u2013 skilful, quality players so it will be a difficult match from a physical perspective.\nThis is the first match between Italy and Wales at a major tournament.\nWales have lost just one of their past 15 competitive games, March\u2019s 3-1 defeat by Belgium in a World Cup qualifier.",

          "text": "After some consideration, Shimelis Yohannes* decided to register to vote in Ethiopia\u2019s delayed general elections due to be held on Monday.\n\n\u201cI took a vote card because it\u2019s better than sitting out the election,\u201d said the civil servant in the capital, Addis Ababa. But, he adds quickly, he has no illusions over a vote that has been overshadowed by conflict in the northern region of Tigray, instability elsewhere and widespread apathy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my vote will change anything or decide the future direction of Ethiopia, but at least I can tell myself I tried my best,\u201d says Yohannes, who will back an opposition party.\n\nWhile he is among the 38 million people who have registered to cast ballots in the national and regional parliamentary polls, Bruk Gemechu*, who lives in Shashemene city, some 250 kilometres (155 miles) southeast of Addis Ababa, says he will abstain.\n\nThe private sector professional says his region of Oromia, Ethiopia\u2019s largest, has no credible opposition parties to compete with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed\u2019s Prosperity Party (PP) after the two most popular ethnic Oromo political parties \u2013 the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) \u2013 decided to boycott the polls. The parties allege that the elections lack legitimacy, citing an inability to compete while high-profile leaders and party members are behind bars and other members are subjected to physical violence.\n\n\u201cThe local PP cadres had been coercing the vulnerable sections of the society to take out voter registration cards and nowadays are threatening them with punishment if they vote for the few candidates of other opposition parties,\u201d alleged Gemechu.\n\nStaff members of the National Electoral Board explain to people how to vote for the upcoming elections [Amanuel Sileshi/AFP]\n\nThe youth from Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic group Oromos, who make up about 35 percent of the country\u2019s estimated 110-plus million people, were at the forefront of two-and-half years of anti-government protests that brought Abiy to power in April 2018.\n\nHowever, Abiy has since fallen out with many of the leaders of the Oromo youth movement. Several leading OFC members, including Jawar Mohammed and Bekele Gerba, remain behind bars on terror charges in connection with the unrest that followed last year\u2019s murder of popular Oromo musician and activist, Hachalu Hundessa.\n\nThe PP, however, insists that the elections will be free and fair \u2013 a historical first in Ethiopia. Monday\u2019s polls will be the sixth since the overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam\u2019s communist government in 1991. The previous five contests \u2013 all won by the now-disbanded Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front four-party alliance \u2013 were marred by accusations of fraud and irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe ruling party is extremely ready to exercise democracy \u2026 and the public is very much eager,\u201d says the PP\u2019s Bikila Wolde. \u201cEven though these opportunities are there, the challenges are also very clear, because Ethiopia has an extremely polarised political system for a very long time, known for dictatorial regimes. Modern and civilised political exercises are scarce in this country.\u201d\n\nWhile the ruling party is touting the vote \u2013 originally scheduled for 2020 but first postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic and then over logistical challenges \u2013 as an opportunity to lessen the temperature of the polarised political environment, some fear it may have the opposite effect.\n\nAn analyst in Addis Ababa, who did not want to be named citing the charged political atmosphere, says the polls will happen amid rising COVID-19 cases and locust invasions, as well as \u201can economy that is in tatters and conflict in Tigray region which has left the region fully humanitarian-aid dependent\u201d.\n\nThe seven-month war in Tigray is estimated to have killed thousands of people, if not more, and displaced some two million, with the United Nations warning this week that 350,000 are suffering famine conditions.\n\n\u201cThe Ethiopian military which was supposed to be tasked with transporting electoral materials is tied up in the Tigray conflict as well as in fighting simmering insurgencies in various parts of Oromia and Benishangul-Gumuz regional states,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cI see it as inconceivable PP gaining electoral legitimacy from the polls at this moment.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the security and logistical challenges facing various parts of Ethiopia, the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) disclosed earlier this month that voting will not take place in nearly one-fifth of Ethiopia\u2019s 547 polls constituencies.\n\nNEBE has said voting in the constituencies not participating next week will go ahead on September 6, but Tigray \u2013 with 38 seats \u2013 is indefinitely excluded for now.\n\n\u201cI see only one constituency that\u2019s represented in the polls; that is the urban elites and the Amhara region,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nWhile the PP is the frontrunner to win a majority of seats, it is expected to face a serious electoral challenge in Addis Ababa and the Amhara region, Ethiopia\u2019s second-most populous.\n\nAlready, several opposition figures have publicly disclosed their acceptance of results is conditional on the vote count being fair.\n\nIn 2005, a police crackdown on unarmed protesters who took to the streets of Addis Ababa to decry election irregularities left nearly 200 demonstrators dead, as well as six police officers.\n\nBoth Yohannes and the analyst shared concerns over potential post-election violence in the two areas seen as the most electorally competitive, but Abiy in his final campaign rally on Wednesday predicted that the polls will be peaceful.\n\n\u201cThe whole world is saying we will fight but we will show them differently,\u201d Abiy told supporters in the town of Jimma. \u201cI say to all Ethiopians [engaged] in the struggle to ensure a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Ethiopia,\u201d added the prime minister, who earlier in June had accused \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d of working to undermine Ethiopia.\n\nOn Saturday, fewer than 48 hours before polls open, police officers in central Addis Ababa took part in a parade attended by senior government officials purportedly to display the police force\u2019s new uniforms.\n\nFor the analyst, even if fears of post-election violence do not materialise, the near-term future of post-election Ethiopia will not be rosy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the election changing neither the deteriorating security environment not the increasing pressure from parts of the international community,\u201d the analyst said.\n\n\u201cI see the military stalemate in the Tigray between rebels and the Ethiopian army \u2013 supported by Eritrean and neighbouring Amhara region forces \u2013 continuing for now while the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, and frustrated Oromo youths continuing to join the outlawed Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) rebel movement,\u201d the analyst added.\n\n\u201cFragmented sanctions from Western nations (in connection to the Tigray war) are likely to be increased, with the effects bound to first affect the lower economic class of the society before it reaches high-level government officials.\u201d",

          "text": "Brazil\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 500,000 on Saturday as experts warn that the world\u2019s second-deadliest outbreak may worsen due to delayed vaccinations and the government\u2019s refusal to back social distancing measures.\n\nOnly 11% of Brazilians have been fully vaccinated and epidemiologists warn that, with winter arriving in the southern hemisphere and new variants of the coronavirus circulating, deaths will continue to mount even if immunizations gain steam.\n\nBrazil has registered 500,800 deaths from 17,883,750 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to Health Ministry data on Saturday, the worst official death toll outside the United States. Over the past week, Brazil has averaged 2,000 deaths per day.\n\nCOVID-19 continues to devastate countries around the region with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reporting 1.1 million new cases of COVID-19 and 31,000 deaths in the Americas last week. PAHO noted upticks in six Mexican states, Belize, Guatemala, Panama and some places in the Caribbean.\n\nPAHO warned that Colombia\u2019s COVID-19 situation is at its worst point yet, with intensive care unit beds filled in major cities.\n\nExperts see the toll in Brazil, already the highest in Latin America, climbing far higher.\n\n\u201cI think we are going to reach 700,000 or 800,000 deaths before we get to see the effects of vaccination,\u201d said Gonzalo Vecina, former head of Brazilian health regulator Anvisa, predicting a near-term acceleration in fatalities.\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing the arrival of these new variants and the Indian variant will send us for a loop.\u201d\n\nVecina criticized far-right President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s handling of the pandemic, including the lack of a coordinated national response and his skepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements, which he has sought to loosen.\n\nThousands of Brazilians protested against Bolsonaro\u2019s management of the pandemic in nationwide demonstrations on Saturday, blaming the administration for the high death toll and calling for the president\u2019s ouster.\n\nRaphael Guimaraes, a researcher at Brazilian biomedical center Fiocruz, said delays in the vaccination program in Latin America\u2019s most populous nation meant its full effects would not be felt until September or later.\n\nGuimaraes warned that Brazil could revisit scenes from the worst of its March-April peak, when the country averaged 3,000 deaths per day.\n\n\u201cWe are still in an extremely critical situation, with very high transmission rates and hospital bed occupancy that is still critical in many places,\u201d he said.\n\nThis week, new confirmed cases in Brazil accelerated to more than 70,000 per day on average, edging past India for the most in the world.\n\nVaccination will be crucial in beating the virus in Brazil, since the country has failed to reach a consensus on social distancing and masks, said Ester Sabino, an epidemiologist at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\u201cWe really need to increase vaccination very quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, evidence from neighboring Chile, which like Brazil has relied overwhelming on a vaccine developed by China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O), suggests it may be months before mass immunization will effectively curb transmission.\n\nNearly half of Chileans have been vaccinated, but their capital Santiago just went back into lockdown as cases surged again to near peak levels.\n\nBrazil will need to inoculate some 80 million people to reach Chile\u2019s current per capita vaccination levels.\n\nThat will require a more consistent supply of vaccines and ingredients in Brazil, which have been spotty in recent months, as imports from China were delayed after Bolsonaro antagonized Beijing with comments perceived as anti-Chinese.",
