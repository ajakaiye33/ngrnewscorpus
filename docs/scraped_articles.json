          "title": "Lagos and imperatives of environmental rebirth",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Omolara Otuyemi\n\nCLEANER environment is among the yardsticks for ranking cities and for attracting multinational investors. Since it came on board in 2019, the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration has demonstrated clear willingness to enhance improvement in the state of Lagos environment. One of the earliest actions of Governor Sanwo-Olu was the signing of his first Executive Order to address sanitation as well as cleaning of drainage channels in the state.\n\nThe administration resolved to rid the state of waste, necessitating the introduction of \u201cLagos at 4am\u201d operation and other laudable initiatives aimed at improving the state\u2019s environmental architecture. \u201cLagos at 4 am\u201d is an initiative to ensure wastes are evacuated and carted away in the early hours of the day as it is done in major global cities.\n\nRecently, an unprecedented intervention was implemented to address logistical and operational shortfall in collection of waste across the state as Governor Sanwo-Olu bolstered the fleet of the Lagos State Waste Management Authority, LAWMA, with 102 units of brand new locally assembled compactor trucks and 100 units of double dino waste bins. The assets comprised 30 units of 12-cubic meter trucks, 60 units of 24-cubic meter trucks and 12 hook loaders.\n\nThey will be complementing over 850 PSP compactor trucks to enhance service delivery in under-served communities across the State. The intervention represents one of the largest singular investments ever in the waste management sector in Lagos. Currently, rehabilitation work is ongoing at the state-owned compost facility in Odogunyan, Ikorodu, while government has ramped up resources for the construction of three new transfer-loading stations to provide the infrastructure that would facilitate the effective disposal of solid waste.\n\nOne other vital strategy that the Sanwo-Olu administration has employed to improve waste management in the state is ensuring synergy between PSP operators and LAWMA. Presently, LAWMA is effectively collaborating with the PSP operators. The effort has been boosting human capacity in waste collection, with over 30,000 jobs generated. LAWMA had increased the number of trips completed daily at the landfill from 357 to 850 on average; 87 new waste collection vendors were engaged to drive up efficiency in the value chain. The Blue Box Initiative was also launched as a single stream recyclable collection programme that encourages the separation of recyclable materials from the general waste at the point of generation. The overall objective is to divert as much as 40 per cent of waste generated at the household level from the landfill as an integrated approach towards the management of the three dumpsites at Olusosun, Soluos and Igando.\n\nCurrently, the state is transiting from traditional waste management to conversion of waste materials \u2013 an innovation that is projected to generate 6,000 jobs. The recycling is also expected to promote a cleaner environment, promoting good health and boosting aesthetics. Waste conversion is necessitated by the limitation of the state to set up new dumpsites. The fact that the existing dumpsites had overreached their holding capacities prompted the switch to waste conversion to reduce the volume of waste being taken to the dumpsites.\n\nAlready, the pilot scheme for recycling has been rolled out by government in organised housing estates via a mobile application known as PAKAM, which enables users to request for pick-up of recyclable materials from their homes by registered aggregators on the mobile application. The mobile app\u2019s usage has been growing organically, as over 2,000 kilograms of waste transactions are being conducted on the app, which registered 41 recyclers and over 120 aggregators.\n\nConcerning efforts to address flooding, a total of 42 primary channels were approved and executed under maintenance and dredging of the Primary Channels programme; 34 channels were executed by direct implementation, while eight channels were executed by contracts. Most of these primary channels span across multiple local government areas and effectively drain several catchment areas simultaneously. From 2019 till date, government has completed projects of more than 100km in length. Work has also begun on the construction and concrete lining of the nine kilometers stretch Akinola Aboru Channel with a completion period of 24 months.\n\nThe Akinola River(Aboru canal) is made up of two alignments: the Aboru part takes off from the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway after Iyana Ipaja, cutting across Ige Road in Aboru Community and Command Road in Agbado Oke-Odo LCDA on the right. It takes its flow from as far as Ogun State from Oke-Aro, Ifako Ijaiye, Agege and Alimosho.\n\nSimilarly, rehabilitation work has been carried out on 13 secondary channels at Abraham Adesanya Collector Drain/Dredging of System 63, Lekki Expressway, Lekki Expressway, Ogombo and its adjoining areas, Freedom Way Channel, Lekki and Orchid Road Collector drains off Lekki-Epe Expressway in Eti-Osa. Other areas where dredging and construction of drainage channels are ongoing include the Osapa Lagoon Channel (to de-flood Ologolo Lekki Expressway at Jakande and the Kusenla regional roads), the drains from Odugunwa Street through Buraimoh Alli Fetuga, Ogunmekan Onabola and Charley Boy that discharges into Gbagada Bariga Channel.\n\nAnother major ongoing project on the Mainland is the Demurin Ogunsowobo Collector drain, which after completion will de-flood Feyintolu, Ogunsowobo, Oyebanji, Igbonla, Baale Streets and its environs in Alapere-Ketu. The Channel receives storm water from Ikorodu Road at Ketu and discharges into Lagos Lagoon via Ketu-Alapere Channel.\n\nAnother set of 44 new collectors at various stages of construction are Da Costa/Adesina/Zanzi Collector Drain in Yaba, Ajiran Outfall Channel in Eti-Osa, Joshua Ede Downstream Channels located at Abaranje in Ikotun, Alimosho, Kushoro Igbayilola Street, Collector Drain Phase II in Agege, Canal Road Collector Drain in Ajeromi-Ifelodun Local Government, Johnson-Bawa-Allah-Onisemo Channels in Shomolu, Adenuga/DFRRI/Jesugbogo Collector Drains within Aro Community in Badagry, Elemoro Collector Drain, Ibeju-Lekki, Collector Drain to deflood Opebi Road, Ikeja, Abeokuta/Olanrewaju Collector Drain in Okokomaiko, Iba LCDA, Ojo, Omolade Osinowo New Ewu Town Collector Drain and Senator Oluremi Tinubu New Era Foundation Collector Drain in Ibeju-Lekki among others. Similarly, on-going cleaning up exercise across the state has helped to improve the state\u2019s environmental landscape. While executing the Governor\u2019s Executive Order, the State Environmental Task Force has begun massive clearing of all illegal structures and shanties built on setbacks on major roads and streets across the state.\n\nOtuyemi is of the Lagos State Ministry of Information & Strategy, Alausa, Ikeja.",

I think Peter Obi\u2019s credentials are very clear and everybody knows.\u201c\n\n\u201cIf God decides that it\u2019s him, then nobody can stop him.

It\u2019s clear that the charlatan can\u2019t read.\n\nThe group noted that contrary to the spurious claims by Saidu, Dikio has done well since he took over the office, insisting that as direct beneficiaries of the programme they are in the right position to assess his performance.\n\nThey explained that the prevailing peace in the region which the Arewa chief and his cohorts are enjoying is largely due to the hardwork of Dikio, working with other key stakeholders in the region.\n\nAccording to them, what has clearly distinguished Dikio from his predecessors is the constant engagement with stakeholders, his all inclusive style of governance and his sincere commitment to honour agreements\n\nas well as fulfill promises he had made.\n\nDescribing Alhaji Saidu as a meddlesome interloper, the group advised the Arewa leader to use the same energy he had dissipated on Dikio to demand for better deal for the North East Development agency.\n\n\u201cOur attention has been drawn to a statement in some national dailies credited to one Alhaji Musa Saidu, a self acclaimed Arewa leader in the South, calling for the sack of our brother and father, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (rtd).\n\n\u201cThe claims in the said statement is laughable and could only have come from a delusioned mind who is obviously blind to see that under Dikio there is sustained peace in the region and that the usual protest that led to several blockage of major parts of the East/West road like the Mbiama axis has stopped.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Musa Saidu is also blind to see that under Dikio ex-agitators and members of impacted communities in the region are being trained in different industries just as the payment of the monthly stipends has become more prompt than ever before.\n\n\u201cWe urge Alhaji Musa Saidu to focus on the North East Development agency, where he is a stakeholder and stop his treacherous acts capable of instigating unnecessary tension in the Niger Delta. We will not allow that\u201d.\n\nThey warned that henceforth they will not fail to name and shame all those who are behind the monumental corruption that had rocked the amnesty programme before Dikio and will lead a massive protest to call for their probe.",

Biodun Oyebanji of evading service to begin his petition before the Election Petition Tribunal against his victory.\n\nThe counsels to the petitioner, also alleged that the Yobe State Governor and former National Caretaker Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Mai Mala Buni and Oyebanji\u2019s deputy, Monisade Afuye, had been difficult to serve on account of lack of fixed addresses.\n\nAlleging that such antic was geared towards stalling the petition, Oni\u2019s counsels averred that they had on July 20, 2022, at the Election Petition Tribunal filed an application for substituted service for speedy service and prompt trial of the case.\n\nOni had on July 7, 2022 filed his petition before the Tribunal in Ado Ekiti, calling for the reversal of the declaration of Oyebanji as the winner of the election.\n\nOni also urged the court to declare him the winner of the poll, claiming that he scored the highest number of lawful votes in the poll.\n\nThe petitioner urged the Tribunal to in the alternative nullify the election and order a rerun in view of alleged widespread manipulations that characterised the poll.\n\nThe former Secretary to the State Government and the candidate of the APC, Biodun Oyebanji garnered a total of 187,045 votes to defeat Oni, who polled 82,122 votes in the election.\n\nAddressing journalists in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, Oni\u2019s legal team, led by Obafemi Adewale (SAN), was upbeat that Oni will be declared winner of the poll at the Tribunal in view of the avalanche of evidence to be presented to substantiate their claim of widespread rigging in the poll.\n\nAdewale, who spoke through a former Attorney General and Justice Commissioner in Ekiti, Owoseeni Ajayi, said: \u201cFact speaks for itself. Segun Oni ought to have been declared winner because he scored the highest number of valid votes, but this couldn\u2019t happen because the election was characterised by widespread irregularities.\n\n\u201cWe filed our petition on July 7 within the time stipulated for us in the Electoral Act. Since that time, we have been having issues of service.\n\n\u201cINEC had been served without restriction. The APC had also been served in Abuja without restriction. But we have problem serving the governor-elect, Biodun Oyebanji, his deputy, Monisade Afuye and the caretaker chairman of the party when the candidate was elected at the primary, Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cThere had been deliberate avoidance of service by these respondents. In any election petition, time is of essence because we have to conclude the petition within 181 days.\n\n\u201cIn the election petition trial, the days started counting the very day we filed our petition and it also includes their 21 days to which they must respond to our petition.\n\n\u201cTo make things difficult, the governor-elect and his deputy have no addresses and the only place to serve them is the party secretariat in Ado Ekiti that is now locked up, we can\u2019t reach them.\n\n\u201cThe Bailiff of the tribunal went to Abuja\u2019s liaison office of Yobe State Governor, their officials resisted being served. They said they can\u2019t collect the letters on his behalf.\n\n\u201cService is of essence in any case and they have to be served personally, except we are given this option of substituted service.\n\n\u201cWe are not resting and we are desirous of going with the litigation until Oni, who won the majority of the lawful votes is declared the winner\u201d, Obafemi stated.\n\nObafemi posited further that the petitioner has credible evidence to present that would influence the Panelists to give favourable judgement to Oni and SDP.\n\n\u201cWe have proof of widespread malpractices and manipulations that really offended the Electoral Act in the election.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that there won\u2019t be any reason to order a fresh election. By the time we will finish our case, there will be declaration of the petitioner as the validly elected candidate\u201d, Obafemi boasted.",

This Fund is something that will be incredibly important to help us help those who need it.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that about 260 million people depend on fishery for their daily survival, adding that 12 million of these people are in Africa.\n\nShe, therefore, advised Nigeria to deposit the instrument of acceptance in WTO as well as fine-tune other things required for the country to benefit.\n\nSpeaking, the Minister commended the Director-General for her sterling leadership and tenacity that led to the positive outcomes of the MC12.\n\nKatagum assured that Nigeria would not rest on her oars in the implementation of the outcomes of the Conference, adding that steps have been taken to ensure timely and effective implementation of these outcomes. Nigeria welcomes the outcomes of the MC12 and notes the great progress that the MC12 made.\n\n\u201cWe note, however, that we must not rest on our oars but should take this success recorded at the MC12 as a sign that with the right leadership, a lot can be done and we must build on this momentum to make progress in all other outstanding areas of work at the WTO,\u201d the minister said.",

          "text": "With crippling inflation and the economy not looking good, students and parents are faced with dilemma over rent renewal as the industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) hits 157 days. CHIBUIKE NWACHUKWU (UNN) reports.\n\nIt is no longer news that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) went on strike since February 14 to make Federal Government accede to its demands.\n\nChief among the issues, which caused the face-off with the Federal Government, is the refusal of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to deploy the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), a payment system presented by the union as a replacement for the government\u2019s controversial Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), among others.\n\nDespite President Buhari\u2019s appeal to the union to sheathe its sword and return to their classrooms in the interest of \u201cour students and the country,\u201d the union reiterated that it would call off the strike only if government approves its two principal demands \u2014 accept UTAS and the renegotiated 2009 agreement.\n\nOn Tuesday, the President also directed the Education Minister, Mallam Adamu Adamu to proffer solution to the strike in two weeks.\n\nHowever, students across ASUU-affiliated institutions in the country continue to suffer from the prolonged industrial action by the union.\n\nOne of such is Emeka Aneke, a 400-Level student at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State.He was distraught over the delay the strike caused him.\n\nThe strike had commenced in the second semester of the academic session, when he was about to graduate.\n\nHaving gained admission in 2017 to study a four-year course, he could not graduate last year because of ASUU strike then and the COVID-19 lockdown that disrupted academic activities.\n\nFast forward to 2022, Aneke is at a loss regarding when he would graduate. He does not know when the ongoing strike would be called off despite efforts by government and other stakeholders.\n\nThus, he resorted to helping his mother in her petty business.\n\nNevertheless, with the strike still on, students are getting calls from their landlords to either renew rent or quit their apartments.Aneke said his landlord called him three months into the strike to renew his rent.\n\n\u201cRight now, I am not in a haste to return to school because I do not have N110, 000 to renew my rent. If the strike is called off, I may not have a place to stay,\u201d he said.\n\nLike Aneke, many students of ASUU-affiliated institutions across the country, who live in private hostels off-campus, are in difficult situation as the strike has forced them and their parents to pay for apartments they are not using.\n\nThose who live in school hostels, however, are safe from this problem as they pay both tuition and accommodation fees every session, therefore, are not required to pay another till the session ends.\n\nA student, who pleaded anonymity, said: \u201cAvailable hostel facilities in the various public universities are inadequate as a result of the increase in population of students. The hostels can only accommodate a handful of students. The rest seek alternative in private hostels outside campuses.\n\nBesides the extended stay in school, caused by the regular and prolonged strikes by ASUU, students lose money paid to landlords of private hostels during strikes. Also, the safety of their properties in the uninhabited apartments are not guaranteed as thieves break into them.\u201d\n\nLamentations from students and parents\n\nFor Ifiok Etim, a 400-Level student at the University of Calabar, landlords do not care if ASUU is on strike or school not in session. \u201cMy landlord clearly told me that tenancy period is not determined by such issues,\u201d he said.\n\nEtim, who had stayed in his rented apartment a little over a month before the strike commenced, is expected to renew his rent or move his properties.\n\n\u201cMy experience with my landlord left me speechless. I paid N120, 000 in January for six months, since I had just one semester to stay in school. In February, ASUU went on strike,\u201d he explained.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cFirst week of June, my landlord called to remind me that my rent will expire at month end. Right now, I am making arrangement to move my things, pending when the strike ends. There is no need renewing my rent when I am not sure the strike will end soon.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Amarachi Azoribe, a 200-Level student of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), who paid six months rent in January said she is expecting call from her landlord.\n\n\u201cMy rent expired in June. My landlord has not called yet, but I know he will. I am already expecting his call.\n\n\u201cBesides paying for a place I left months ago, I am also worried about the safety of my properties and some food items I left behind. I heard hostels were robbed,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that she will also have to clear electricity bill when ever she returns to the hostel.\n\n\u201cImagine paying for power you did not use because of the estimated bill practice in the country,\u201d she said.\n\nChioma Ikeh, another female student of the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus (UNEC), could not hide her frustration. For this student, apart from the disruption of academic calendar, the industrial action will make her spend more money on rent than she had already planned.\n\nShe said: \u201cI paid my rent in December, 2021. I figured that since I am in 300 Level, my rent will likely expire when I am doing my final year project.\u201d\n\nShe explained that if not for this strike, her next rent would have been for six months as she would need to spend more time in school to finalise her project.\n\n\u201cNow, I have to pay another N200, 000 next year. Where would I see such amount? Honestly, the strike is frustrating,\u201d she said.\n\nThe mother of a 100-Level student, Mrs Bridget Onovo, who paid her daughters rent a week before ASUU declared the warning strike said it feels like she threw money away.\n\nAccording to her, her daughter was yet to move into the newly rented apartment when the strike commenced.\n\n\u201cWe paid N120, 000 for an apartment that has remained unoccupied. We have lost N40, 000 already and may lose more because we do not know when it will end,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking on the pain of renewing the rent of a vacant apartment, she said: \u201cI called the landlord to inquire if something could be done about the situation as my daughter has not moved in before the strike commenced. But he said there was nothing he could do.\u201d\n\nLandlord and caretakers speak\n\nHostel owners and caretakers have sympathised with students, but said they built the hostels to make money and also need rents to maintain them.\n\nSome argued that it was not the fault of landlords that ASUU and Federal Government have refused to resolve their differences.\n\nA landlord in UNN, who refused to give his name and pleaded for his hostel not to be captured \u201cfor security reasons,\u201d expressed concern over the plight of parents and their wards. He said it is unfortunate that people are financially burdened at a time of severe hardship in the country.\n\nHe, however, called on parents that beg landlords to forfeit rents to understand that landlords are also affected by the economic situation of the country.\n\n\u201cThey forget that landlords are also parents that may have children in public universities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have two children in different universities. The hostels they live are not mine. If I do not collect rent from my tenants, how would I pay that of my children and take care of other needs?\u201d he added.\n\nHe further said he would not demand rent from unavailable tenants, but he expects full payment when they return to school.\n\nThe caretaker of Our Saviour Hostel in UNN, who refused to be named, insisted that running the apartment block was hard without sufficient fund so, \u201cwe cannot wait for the strike to be called off before we collect rent. Money is needed for essentials like water and light.\n\n\u201cI have contacted all the tenants for the renewal of their rent. The ones who left school said they will pay when they return, while those still occupying their apartments have paid,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that when the students return to school, \u201cthey would also need to pay light bill since light billing is based on estimation for buildings without prepaid metres.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not for the basic amenities we provide in the hostel that requires money, we would have considered taking some months off for the tenants,\u201d the caretaker said.\n\nFor Mr Ugwu, the caretaker of Royal Apartments, UNN, the ongoing strike is not the fault of students so, there is no need calling and demanding tenancy renewal from them.\n\n\u201cWe have tenants whose rents have expired, but the fact is that they are not around. I cannot call people I do not know when I would see. So, we will wait till the strike is called off and they return to school,\u201d he said.\n\nParents, business owners and other stakeholders have continually appealed to both ASUU and the Federal Government to resolve the issues for the sake of the students whose academic programmes has extended.\n\nStakeholders also called for the end of the strike in the interest of parents who are compelled to spend more than necessary in training their children in the country\u2019s public institutions.",

          "title": "Terrorist attacks: FG mulls nationwide ban on motorcycles, mining",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Chukwuma Umeorah\n\nThe National Security Council presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari has unveiled measures being considered to thwart terrorist activities, including a nationwide ban on motorcycles and mining to cut off their sources of funding.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who briefed State House Correspondents along side his Interior and Police Affairs counterparts, Rauf Aregbesola and Mohammed Dingyadi, respectively, at the end of the meeting, said the decision to focus on the logistics used by the terrorists was deliberate. He said the ban would include motorcycles used for movement and mining, which provides them the money to fund their arms supply.\n\nMalami added that Federal Government is now looking into ways to stymie their actions by blocking the already identified sources.He noted that terrorists have shifted from traditional methods of funding to mining and ransom taking, necessitating government action.\n\nMinister of Interior confirmed that significant efforts were made to gather intelligence prior to the recent attack on the Kuje Correctional Centre, but expressed regret that there was a lack of will to act on it.\n\nAregbesola, who said the preliminary investigation on the attack had been submitted to the president, assured that all those found to have shirked their responsibilities at the end of the ongoing investigation would be punished.\n\n\u201cPlacing a ban on the use of motorcycles and mining activities will cut the supply of logistics to the terrorists. This will be done in the national interest. We are Nigerians because Nigeria as a country exists and any issue that will translate into a threat to national security or the corporate existence of the country requires certain sacrifices.\n\n\u201cSo, regardless of the means that is being considered for the possible banning, this is a sacrifice that we see as what will help address the security challenges and I think no sacrifice is too big as far as that issue is concerned.\n\n\u201cAbove all, if you are talking of banning motorcycles for example, I think the number of people using these motorcycles is not up to 20 percent of the Nigerian population. So, if that percentage is called to make a sacrifice that is all pervading or affecting over 200 million Nigerians, I think that sacrifice is not too much and is worthy of being considered.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Minister, the responsibility of government is to protect the public interest over individual interests, so the bans being considered by the government are in the national interest.\n\nMalami stated that since government\u2019s blockage of terrorist funding sources, the enemies of the state have resorted to using unconventional sources of funding, such as mining and ransom collection, to fund their nefarious activities.\n\nIt\u2019ll worsen insecurity -Ejiofor, ex-DSS boss\n\nSecurity expert and former director of Department of State Services (DSS), Mike Ejiofor, has warned that banning of commercial motorcycles would increase security challenges in the country.\n\nEjiofor who spoke on a television interview monitored in Lagos, said if government go ahead with its decision, it would have great socio-economic implications and also worsen insecurity rather than solve the problem\n\nHe advised that if a nationwide ban must be implemented, government needs to provide a viable alternative for the high number of Nigerians who will be left without a daily source of income, pointing out that they could easily see crime as a way out and a means of survival.\n\nHe, however, said government should map out those areas where okada is generally used to commit crime and implement a ban in those areas.\n\n\u201cI think what government should do is to identify established areas, especially in the North West where you have these bandits using bikes and ban the motorcycles in those areas.\u201d\n\nHe also said ease of movement in rural areas should be considered before implementation of a nationwide okada ban. He said motor vehicles cannot easily access most rural areas and a ban would only increase the untold hardship of Nigerians in those areas.\n\n\u201cIf we say there is a ban on motorcycles, how would people be travelling ,especially in rural areas and remote communities?\u201d he queried.\n\nHe advised that government needed to restrategise with regards to security challenges in the country and how to tackle them.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim and Isaac Anumihe, Abuja\n\nNigeria recorded a N3.09 trillion deficit in its 2022 budget operations between January and April.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, made the startling revelation on Thursday at the Public Consultative Forum on the draft Federal Government 2023-2025 Medium Term Fiscal Framework & Fiscal Strategy, in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the deficit brought to the fore the lingering fiscal challenges facing the government.\n\nAside the staggering deficit, Ahmed pushed for complete elimination of petrol subsidy, stressing that projections show that fuel subsidy may gulp about N6.72 trillion in 2023, a development that could wipe off the nation\u2019s entire revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWe have two scenarios here. Business-as-Usual scenario: This assumes that the subsidy on PMS, estimated at N6.72 trillion for full year 2023, will remain and be fully provided for.\n\n\u201cScenario 2 \u2013Reform scenario: This assumes that petrol subsidy will remain up to mid-2023 based on the 18-month extension announced early 2021, in which case only N3.36 trillion will be provided for.\n\n\u201cAs of April 2022, FGN\u2019s retained revenue was only N1.63 trillion, 49 per cent of the prorata target of N3.32 trillion.\n\n\u201cThe actual spending as of April 31st was N4.72 trillion. Of the N4. 72 trillion, N1.94 trillion was spent on debt service; N1.26 trillion on personnel cost, including pensions; and N773.63 billion on capital expenditure\u201d.\n\nThe Minister further disclosed that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) which hitherto funded the fuel subsidy until last month would offload that responsibility to the federation.\n\nThis, she noted would further exert a huge strain on the fiscal position of the Federal Government, while describing fuel subsidy as a monster that must be decimated. The Minister frowned at the low oil revenue amid hefty subsidy payouts, that has resulted in zero remittance to the Federation Account by the NNPC.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe gross oil and gas federation revenue for full year 2022 was projected at N9.37 trillion. As at April 30, 2022, N1.23 trillion was realised out of the prorata projection of N3.12 trillion, representing a mere 39 per cent performance.\n\n\u201cDespite higher oil prices, oil revenue underperformed due to significant oil production shortfalls for two main reasons: oil production shut-ins resulting from pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft; and high petrol subsidy cost due to higher landing costs of imported products.\n\nShe added, \u201cActual average crude oil price is higher than the budget benchmark price of $73 per barrel. However, higher oil price is offset by lower oil output, which as of April 2022 stood at an average of 1.32 mbpd.\u201d",
          "summary": "From Uche Usim and Isaac Anumihe, AbujaNigeria recorded a N3.09 trillion deficit in its 2022 budget operations between January and April.\nAccording to the Minister, the deficit brought to the fore the lingering fiscal challenges facing the government.\n72 trillion, N1.94 trillion was spent on debt service; N1.26 trillion on personnel cost, including pensions; and N773.63 billion on capital expenditure\u201d.\nShe added, \u201cActual average crude oil price is higher than the budget benchmark price of $73 per barrel.\nHowever, higher oil price is offset by lower oil output, which as of April 2022 stood at an average of 1.32 mbpd.\u201d",

          "title": "BEFORE ANOTHER UDOJI (ASUU) AWARDS \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "JOSEPH ATOBISI contends that the federal government should be careful in negotiating pay rise with ASUU\n\nThe strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has entered its sixth month. The protracted industrial action, no doubt, is taking its toll on students, parents, the university workers themselves and the educational system in Nigeria as a whole. If the strike drags till September, it means that a whole academic session has been lost. Like all well-meaning Nigerians, I am deeply concerned about this unwholesome situation in our university system, being fully aware of the role of education in national development. Besides, not all Nigerian parents can afford to send their children to study abroad, like the privileged few.\n\nI am not against the lecturers and the other university workers demanding for better conditions of service. I have heard the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, the chief conciliator of the industrial dispute, express sadness that university professors in Nigeria earn less than half a million Naira monthly. To me, this is disproportionate to the services they render in our ivory towers and a far cry from what their counterparts in neighbouring African countries are earning.\n\nOne, however, expects any agitation by ASUU for better welfare to take into consideration the wellbeing of the students and the prevailing economic realities in the country today. The contrary appears to be the case, even when facts in the public domain show that the federal government has fully implemented five out of all the seven issues listed in the Memorandum of Action (MOA) signed by the government and ASUU.\n\nFor now, the two outstanding demands, which appear intractable, are the contentious payment platform and the renegotiation of the conditions of service of the university workers. The payment platform developed by ASUU, the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) is being tested by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), alongside the government platform, the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS) and the University Peculiar Payroll Payment System (U3PS) developed by SSANU and NASU. Meanwhile, the other university-based unions are insisting that even if ASUU\u2019s UTAS is 100 percent perfect, they won\u2019t be part of it. With the uncompromising stance of the two non-teaching unions, the government has found itself between the devil and the deep blue sea.\n\nThe renegotiation of conditions of service of the university workers is another thorny issue. The process started in 2016-2017 when the Federal Government inaugurated a committee headed by Wale Balakin (SAN) for the exercise. Babalakin was at that time the Pro-Chancellor of University of Lagos. Following protest by ASUU, the Federal Government replaced Babalakin with Professor Jubril Munzali whose committee eventually proposed 200 percent rise in emoluments of the university workers\n\nThe government rejected the Munzali proposal owing to the financial implications. The National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) in particular said the document failed to comply with its template for wage increase. At this point, Ngige was approached, and he saw nothing with a renegotiation on the grounds that even a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), could be renegotiated. This was the situation when the Munzali committee elapsed. A new committee headed by Professor Nimi Briggs was put in place by the Federal Ministry of Education. The Briggs committee has concluded its assignment, proposing 180 percent wage increase for ASUU members and 109 percent for members of the other university-based unions.\n\nThe said outcome of the Briggs committee is now a subject of accusations and counter accusations between ASUU and the Federal Government. Contrary to the claim of ASUU that there is an agreement awaiting the President\u2019s endorsement, Ngige insisted that the report of the Briggs committee is a mere proposal like that of its predecessor, Prof. Jubril Munzali. The Minister accused ASUU of trying to circumvent the relevant government authorities in charge of fixing wages in order to get the government to sign the proposal.\n\nFor now, it remains to be seen whether the Federal Government will at the end of the day, agree to the Briggs proposal, considering the poor state of the economy. Truth be told, the country\u2019s fiscal position is deteriorating, resulting in higher debts and shrinking investment in infrastructure and human capital. Just last month, the then Acting Accountant General of the Federation, Anamekwe Nwabuoku disclosed that \u201cgovernment income is challenged, and the country borrows to pay salaries.\u201d Also, the World Bank projects that an additional one million Nigerians would be pushed into poverty by the end of 2022.\n\nMost younger generation Nigerians, especially those born after the 1970s may not have heard about the controversial 1974 Udoji Award. After the bloody Nigeria/Biafra civil war in 1970, the Federal Government under General Yakubu Gowon as the Military Head of State, set up the Public Service Review Commission headed by Chief Jerome Udoji, to reform the public service, with the aim of ensuring development and optimum utilisation of manpower for efficiency and effectiveness in the service.\n\nThe Gowon administration gave the Udoji commission the mandate to carry out a holistic reform of the civil service in terms of organisation, structure and management of the public service, investigate and evaluate methods of recruitment and conditions of service, establish scale of salaries corresponding to each grade and examine all legislations relating to pensions. Among other recommendations, the Udoji Commission proposed a 100 percent review of salaries across board, in spite of warnings by economists that such an increase in salaries of public servants could spell doom for the economy in future. The Gowon administration accepted the proposal, arguing that it did so to reward public servants for their support and dedication during the civil war.\n\nThe Udoji Award, which came at the time of the oil boom in the 70s, made everybody excited as there was so much cash in the system. Even before the Government announced the award, traders started hoarding their goods in anticipation of the rise in the salaries of workers. As soon as it was announced, the missing goods reappeared on the shelves with increased price tags. True to the prediction of economists, the Udoji Award fuelled consumption with Nigerians engaging in spending spree. Civil servants developed appetite for imported commodities like sugar, canned milk, stockfish, dumping available local alternatives. More workers bought cars, furniture and expensive furniture. Nigeria soon became an import dependent nation. The manufacturing industry started collapsing. Unemployment spiraled. From 5.40 percent in 1973, inflation rose to 12.67 percent in 1974 and 33.96 percent in 1975.\n\nMany economic pundits believe that the 1974 Udoji Award and the later Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) introduced in the mid-1980s by then Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida, contributed massively to the continuous downward trajectory of the Nigerian economy till date. Hence, I will conclude by appealing to ASUU to show more understanding, notwithstanding the overwhelming public sympathy on their side. Indira Ghandi, the first and only female Prime Minister of India till date, once said: \u201cHistory is the best teacher, who has the worst students.\u201d Will ASUU prove her wrong? Time will tell.\n\n\u00b7 Atobisi, a labour activist writes from Abuja\n\n",

          "text": "The loss of Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun State, in the recent gubernatorial contest despite his relatively good performance, disincentivizes good governance, writes Bolaji Adebiyi\n\nAsked for his reaction to the loss of his party, at the just concluded gubernatorial contest in Osun State, Abdullahi Adamu, the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, feigned ignorance of the result of an election that had been officially announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission in the wee hours of the day.\n\n\u201cINEC is yet to inform me of the result,\u201d he told the ARISE NEWS Channel anchors who laboured in vain to wake him from his contrived slumber. It was not that Adamu was not aware of the result of the contest, it was obvious that he was perplexed by its unpalatable outcome and was still grappling to understand how his party failed to breast the tape.\n\nA few weeks earlier, he had told the national campaign committee headed by Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos State, to go win the contest by all means possible, warning it that he would not accept any excuses for failure. \u201cJust go and win,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cLet the losers go to the tribunal to complain.\u201d Not a few observers, including opposition politicians, thought this was a bit too confident, and perhaps, arrogant, suggesting that he needed to be more circumspect.\n\nThe outcome of the election, though close, has proved the observers right as it is Adamu and his APC that will now have to approach the tribunal with their complaints having been trounced by the opposing Peoples Democratic Party whose candidate, Ademola Adeleke, an immediate past senator, polled 403, 371 votes to the APC\u2019s Gboyega Oyetola\u2019s 375,027.\n\nThe 28,344 margin of victory garnered across 17 of the state\u2019s 30 local councils, was sufficient for INEC to make a declaration that the contest, in which one Kehinde Atanda of an innocuous Action Democratic Party came a distant third with 10, 104 votes, had been decided against the incumbent party. From Adamu\u2019s mien on ARISE TV that Sunday morning it was obvious that the result confounded him and that he was searching for the reasons for the defeat.\n\nLike Adamu, hours after the announcement of the result, the APC camp was quiet and when a day or so later it found its voice, the resolve came from Osogbo, the state capital, that 50 lawyers would be assembled to take the party\u2019s complaints to the tribunal. Some critics have, however, said this is more of a political strategy by the party to control possible haemorrhaging by keeping hope alive. For, as they put it, the leadership ought to have known that its failure to resolve its pre- and post-primary conflicts would only have an unsavoury consequence like this.\n\nIn fairness to the national chairman, he warned the warring parties to reconcile before the election but his intervention fell on deaf ears. Shortly after the narrow victory of the APC in 2018, a quarrel developed over the distribution of political patronages as Oyetola was accused of marginalising the associates of Rauf Aregbesola, the former governor who had become a minister in Abuja. The other source of the crisis was the disagreements over policies as the new governor found it necessary to review and reverse some of the policies he inherited.\n\nSeveral reconciliation initiatives spearheaded by national leaders of the party associated with the political establishment in the state, including Bola Tinubu, the party\u2019s national leader, now presidential candidate, and Bisi Akande, a former governor of the state who was also a transitional national chairman, failed as there was a hardening of positions on both sides of the divide.\n\nThis was the state of play when the state congress for the gubernatorial primary was held with the Oyetola camp routing the Aregbesola camp. Worsted, the minister returned to Abuja to lick his wound. While some of his associates left the party in anger, many more stayed back, badly wounded and brooding. Had Oyetola not been politically na\u00efve, he would have known that having such a large number of disgruntled politicians in his corner in a contest with an opponent, who had a strong political root and formidable political machinery on the ground, was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIn some ways, Oyetola\u2019s resounding trouncing of Aregbesola at the primary emboldened him to tell his foe to more or less go to hell. What he obviously did not realise was that in a contest that was bound to be that close everyone retained the minimum capacity to do damage. That point was well made by the internal opposition in APC and it resonated in the final results with the effect that the internal opponents titled the outcome in favour of the PDP in otherwise strongholds of the ruling party, including the high-voting councils of Osogbo, Olorunda, Egbedore and Ejigbo. The swing occurred at a time the opposition kept intact its own strongholds of Ede North and Ede South where it got the over 28,000 votes that made the difference.\n\nThe internal squabbles apart, Oyetola also struggled with the liabilities he inherited from Aregbesola who left a debilitating debt profile, large pension and gratuity as well salary areas of civil servants. Despite the fact that the governor offset the outstanding pension and gratuity, paid part of the salary arrears even as he was regular with the payment of the minimum wage from 2018 and reduced substantially the state\u2019s debt, he still did not find favour with the civil service that insisted that he ought to have cleared the backlog of the half-salaries left by Aregbesola.\n\nAs it turned out, it did not matter that Oyetola cleared many of the outstanding liabilities as well as delivered on some infrastructure projects without borrowing. What mattered was his inability to manage the politics of his party and the insatiable appetite of the civil service for self-aggrandisement.\n\nThe outcome of the gubernatorial contest in Osun State has once again queried the belief that a good performance in office would aid a successful electoral outcome. Had performance been the substantive issue in that contest, Oyetola would perhaps have coasted home to victory. But the substantive issue was politics and his mismanagement of it.\n\nThis is the central theme of most of the post-mortems of the contest with many analysts contemplating the consequence of the development, particularly with respect to the public image and profile of the eventual winner who is thought to be playful and not known to be a rigorous interrogator of public policy.\n\nIt is against this background that there is serious worry about the future of the state. But don\u2019t people get the leadership they deserve and live with the consequence?\n\nAdebiyi, the managing editor of THISDAY Newspapers, writes from bolaji.adebiyi@thisdaylive.com",
          "summary": "Some critics have, however, said this is more of a political strategy by the party to control possible haemorrhaging by keeping hope alive.\nWhat mattered was his inability to manage the politics of his party and the insatiable appetite of the civil service for self-aggrandisement.\nThe outcome of the gubernatorial contest in Osun State has once again queried the belief that a good performance in office would aid a successful electoral outcome.\nHad performance been the substantive issue in that contest, Oyetola would perhaps have coasted home to victory.\nBut the substantive issue was politics and his mismanagement of it.",

          "text": "There is nothing to change in the \u2018transformation\u2019 of the NNPC, writes ETIM ETIM\n\nIn a typical Nigerian manner, the NNPC threw a big party in Abuja last Tuesday to announce its transformation from a state-owned enterprise to state-owned commercial enterprise, changing from Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to NNPC Limited. To many Nigerians, it is just a mere name change; just like P&T changed to NET and later to NITEL, and ECN changed to NEPA and later NEP PLC, both without making any meaningful impact in the lives of the citizens. Nigerians have witnessed too many of these unimpactful christening and re christening ceremonies to be impressed. But to President Buhari and the executives in the oil company, NNPC Limited would focus on becoming \u201ca new dynamic global energy company of choice to deliver energy for the future\u201d.\n\nIn other words, NNPC Limited would now be run like the international oil companies that are state-owned, like Saudi Aramco, owned partly by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and American oil investors (ARAMCO actually stands for Arab-American Oil Company) and PETRONAS Global, owned by Malaysia (Yes. That same Malaysia that reportedly borrowed palm fruits from Nigeria in the 1960s and are now the world\u2019s largest producer of palm oil).\n\nPresident Buhari was there at the Tuesday event, and he noted the striking coincidence that had played out. Forty-five years ago, he, as Petroleum Minister, had facilitated the establishment of NNPC under the military r\u00e9gime of General Obasanjo. Now, here he was, an elected President, witnessing its conversion to \u2018\u2019a commercially-driven and independent national oil company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulation\u2026\u2019\u2019\n\nThe ceremony was typically replete with pomp and glee. There were dances, singing and good speeches. A typical government function, full of promise and expectations. But I have my reservations about the new NNPC, and I do not, in all sincerity, believe that it would achieve much; not close to its well-run international peers, unless there is a radical departure from the usual. For as long as the Board, management and employees of NNPC Limited are the same as those that have been managing NNPC, the organizational culture would remain unchanged, and so, this so-called transformation would become an effort in futility. There are so many deeply rooted and entrenched interests in every section of NNPC; and they have been there for so many years that they have become as ossified as Zuma Rock. The culture is anti-business, or at best civil service like, with no orientation for profitability as the organizational or individual goals. Any surprise that none of NNPC\u2019s four refineries has been working in the last two decades? Yet, their workers are earning salaries every month and getting promoted every year.\n\nMost of the management staff of NNPC are from a particular section of the country and they owe their positions to their religious and ethnic affiliations. A good number of the employees got their appointments, not through a competitive recruitment process, but because they were recommended by emirs, senators, governors or other influential military and government officials. Members of the Board of Directors are mostly senior politicians who represent either a geopolitical zone or a political interest. An appointment into NNPC Board is a reward for your role in the political process. With all due respect to Senator (Mrs) Marjorie Okadigbo, she is the Chairman of the place today because her husband was Buhari\u2019s running mate in the 2003 election! President Buhari does not forget a favour. I do not begrudge this benefaction but suffice it to say that neither Aramco nor PETRONAS would be so generous in filling their Board positions.\n\nSo, what should the company do differently this time? First, let me commend Mr Mele Kyari, the CEO of NNPC, for dreaming big and aiming high, by spearheading this change. It is rare for long-serving staffers like Mele to be transformational in outlook. But right from his first day on the job three years ago, he\u2019s been trying to make a difference. I therefore recommend that for NNPC Limited to succeed, Mele Kyari and his management team should serve as interim management of the company for the next two years during which a comprehensive overhaul of the place, to be led by an international consulting firm, should be undertaken. All of the senior and junior management staff should be replaced in the next two years with Nigerians headhunted and recruited from international oil companies like Shell, Chevron, Saudi Aramco (Yes. Many Nigerians are working there); Agip and the rest. Of course, the federal character of the nation should be maintained as much as possible, but without compromising competence, quality and standards.\n\nOne of the reasons the IOCs thrive is because of their high-quality business ethics, principles, practices and processes. Take NLNG for example. Shell is the operator of NLNG, owned 51% by the federal government through NNPC. Although Shell is a minority shareholder, it provides the chief executive and most of the management staff. Initially, the CEOs were foreigners, but in the last 10 years or so, Nigerians, seconded from Shell, have been running the place. Hence, Shell\u2019s business principles and practices prevail there. It is the reason NLNG is so successful that it earnes over $100 billion in revenue paid about $20 billion to the government as dividend and $9 billion tax last year.\n\nTake SEPLAT Energy and First E&P as another example. They are the two most successful Nigerian-owned oil exploration and production companies. It is no coincidence that both are managed by former Shell executives who, of course, are using Shell business principles and processes. I know Shell a bit because I once served as its Media Consultant in the mid-1990s. NNPC Limited cannot or should not re-invent the wheel. The company should take the first correct step and replace its current staff with carefully selected competent Nigerians hired from the IOCs, both within and outside the country. It would be their lot to begin to build a high-achieving culture that rewards success and punishes failure.\n\nThat\u2019s when the real transformation would begin! But if the status quo is maintained, and business continues as usual, this transition would achieve nothing for the country.",

          "title": "The coming presidential election will be crucial for the national economy \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF 2023\n\nFELIX OLADEJI writes\n\nNigeria is a country of immense diversity. Its physical terrain ranges from the mangrove swamp and rain forest in the southern most part of the country to the grassland and semi- arid terrain of the extreme northern reaches of the country. This vegetation structure has imparted a variety of agricultural and economic activities across the length and breadth whose complementarities underlined well developed economic exchanges that predated the colonial processes that created and unified the country. It also encompasses ecological and environmental peculiarities that are not only the sources of economic and social exchanges, but also tensions and conflicts within and between various social groups.\n\nThe huge expanse of land of these historic complementary exchanges is inhabited by people of differing ethnicities, the number of which ranges between 250 and 450. Interspersed with this is a religious diversity that is essentially expressed in two major imports, both of Abrahamic origins (Christianity and Islam), and the indigenous African Traditional Religion. While usually advanced as of monolithic character, the latter aligns closely with its peculiar ethnic and cultural origins, giving it a plural character that may in fact rival the multiplicity of ethnic groups in Nigeria.\n\nEcological, environmental and primordial pluralism are accentuated by social class divisions which are especially mirrored in income levels and access to political power. Gender and generational issues are equally well pronounced and are especially exacerbated by growing economic inequalities. The Nigerian state has perennially tried to grapple with the management of this complex pluralist make-up.\n\nHowever, presidential elections are considered as the most powerful political events and the bedrock of any economy; hence its influence on macroeconomic performance occupies and attracts considerable empirical concerns. Against this backdrop, the impact of presidential elections on broad economic variables and economic performance is a wide economic event study that is currently attracting empirical attention. As a country ruled by successive military governments for more than half of its 56 years as a nation, political instability have had effects on the economic performance. Sound presidential elections rooted in democratic structures and the rule of law are therefore indispensable for improved economic performance.\n\nIt is observed that the incredibility in the presidential election has been observed to hinder growth in the country over time. This is why the onus is on improving the credibility of presidential elections since it is the largest and most important political event in any country. The macroeconomic performance of Nigeria during the period of 1999 to 2014 was impressive, until recently when economic growth rate and other macroeconomic performances variables took a downward dimension on account of the fall in crude oil price which Nigeria mono-culturally depends on. The growth rate increased on account of the increased oil income that was realized during the period Nigeria\u2019s macroeconomic performance over the last decade has been strong.\n\nGrowth averaged 7 percent per year during 2005-2014 which, together with a sharp increase in revenue collection and increased donor funding, provided room for a substantial expansion in public spending. For the period 2013, 2014 and 2015, the growth rates were 6.2%, 6.5% and 6.9% respectively.\n\nDespite the impressive economic growth rates witnessed during these periods, the general economic performance and standard of living did not improve, depicting the growth-poverty paradox or poverty in the midst plenty in which a resource endowed nations remains perpetually poor. Today, the economy is characterized by huge fiscal deficits, rising unemployment coexisting side by side with accelerating inflation, destabilizing exchange rate instability, escalating interest and lending rates, decrepit infrastructures and epileptic power supply which militates against industrialization and growth, and a disgracing and disappointing general growth deceleration and economic performance. Against this backdrop, the World Bank classified Nigeria as one of the poorest nation in the world.\n\nMoreover, evidence from developed democratic societies such as the United States, Germany, Canada, Australia, among others, has shown that presidential election announcement have impacts on economic performance usually measured in terms of broad economic aggregates such as GDP, consumption, investment, inflation, and exchange rate. For instance, it is generally believed that announcement of presidential election has a gearing effects on aggregate demand reflected in consumption, and investment, with a consequent impact on economic growth. This is because the news or announcement of presidential election will generate increased spending on the part of intending presidential aspirants, the ruling party and all other stakeholders using same as political merchandising to sway the public and electorate to voting them. The increased spending and the consequent increase in private and public consumption and investment increases economic growth rate.\n\nApart from these effects, presidential election announcement (news) is believed to affect key economic and performance variables such as exchange rate and inflation. For instance, on the news of the announcement of presidential election, prices of goods generally rises since the increased demand for goods and items on account of the election will consequently increase ,thereby necessitating inflation.\n\nPresidential election announcement in Nigeria is believed to have a dampening effect on economic activities since such news has the tendency of decreasing aggregate demand. The 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019 are clear case of presidential in Nigeria with differing economic effects. The cut in public expenditure in order to accumulate resources for the election, led to a lull in economic activities with a consequent negative effect on stock prices since a direct relationship is presumed to exist between economic output (size) and stock returns. On account of the low economic patronage arising from low economic activities, key macroeconomic variables may be affected.\n\nThis is because the government, discerning public, investors and other stakeholders may embark on a \u2018wait-and see\u2019 attitude before deciding future course of economic action. In general, economic performances during presidential elections in Nigeria have been rather mixed on account of varying domestic and international economic dynamics. Given the fact that Nigeria is oil-dependent, its fiscal and economic operations usually follow development in the oil market. Thus, the very dependence of the economy on oil revenue streams, combined with the global pattern of the world economy dictates the pattern and performance of the economy.\n\nHence, on account of the uncertain and unstable political atmosphere, domestic and foreign investors are usually reduced and economic growth is consequently hindered. No economy can achieve meaningful economic development in atmosphere of political uncertainty such as the one that had characterized Nigeria in the recent past. For economic growth to be enhance, the political environment must be stable, certain and predictable to give credence and credibility to policies and investment, particularly by foreign investors. A stable political environment is therefore a sine quanon for sound economic and meaningful performance.\n\nConclusively, presidential election announcement has strong effects on macroeconomic variables in Nigeria. Although the effects on overall economic performance are not direct, there are channels through which they occur, including investment, government spending and the capital market.\n\nOladeji writes from Lagos",

          "title": "REWIND: In 2019, Atiku warned FG against excessive borrowing",
          "text": "In 2019, Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), raised the alarm over the accumulation of debts by the federal government.\n\nIn an opinion piece, Atiku warned the Muhammadu Buhari-led government that \u201cendless borrowing will lead to endless sorrowing\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal government released a four-month fiscal performance report for 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, the cost of servicing debt surpassed revenue by N310 billion in the first four months of 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report said the federal government\u2019s total revenue for the period was N1.63 trillion, while debt servicing gulped N1.94 trillion.\n\nZainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, called for urgent action to address revenue underperformance and expenditure efficiency at national and sub-national levels.\n\nATIKU\u2019S 2019 OPED\n\nJohn Quincy Adams once said \u201cthere are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.\u201d He may have very well been referring to Nigeria of the last three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarely two weeks ago, I warned during my Founder\u2019s Day lecture at the American University of Nigeria, Yola, that Nigeria had taken almost as much foreign debt in the last three years, as she had taken in the thirty years before 2015 combined. Now that is frightening. And very true.\n\nFrightening, not just because of the amount, but because after such unprecedented borrowing, we have emerged as the world headquarters for extreme poverty and the global capital for out of school children. It begs the question: what were the funds used for?\n\nI have said it time and again. The business of government is too serious to be left in the hands of politicians. We must all ask questions because if they throw away the future, it is not going to be their future they are throwing away, it will be all our futures.\n\nThe fact that Nigeria currently budgets more money for debt servicing (\u20a62.7 trillion), than we do on capital expenditure (\u20a62.4 trillion) is already an indicator that we have borrowed more money than we can afford to borrow. And the thing is that debt servicing is not debt repayment. Debt servicing just means that we are paying the barest minimum allowable by our creditors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while spending 50% of our current revenue on debt servicing, this administration wants to take further loans of $29.6 billion! To say that this is irresponsible is itself an understatement.\n\nAs a businessman, one of the very first things I learnt is that you do not take loans except you are expanding your business. Even as an individual, when your income cannot fund your lifestyle, you are challenged to grow your income, not your borrowings.\n\nEven if this administration borrows $1 trillion, it will never be enough because their challenge is one of capacity. They are not using the funds they already have wisely. They do not need more debt. They need more intellectual capacity.\n\nThe money the Muhammadu Buhari administration wants to borrow to fund its Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) could be acquired without sinking the nation into further debt. All it requires is visionary leadership and business acumen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my economic blueprint, I said that rather than turn in regular losses (which it has consistently been doing), the best thing to do with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation is to reform it. Of course, the administration\u2019s paid propagandists went into overdrive, accusing me of planning to sell the NNPC to my friends. But just last week, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ARAMCO, the most profitable company in the world, took that route and almost broke the global stock market with the most successful initial IPOs in world history, bar none. Ironically, Saudi Aramco raised $29.4 billion via this IPO. Just the amount this administration wants to borrow.\n\nThat could have been Nigeria\u2019s story, but for our failure of leadership. By reforming the NNPC, Nigeria can raise the $29.6 billion the Buhari regime wants to borrow, and we will raise the money without going into debt.\n\nIf we had taken that route, not only would we have attracted Foreign Direct Investment into Nigeria, but even better than investment, we would have attracted confidence in our economy, because it would have shown that we have a thinking leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the example of the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas company. This is a joint venture between the Nigeria government and the private sector. Yet, while the NLNG declares very handsome profits, in billions of dollars every year, the NNPC declares loses! This is proof that the NLNG model works, and the NNPC model does not.\n\nMoody\u2019s, the world\u2019s preeminent rating agency, has just downgraded Nigeria. Ghana, a nation with only 15% of our population, now attracts more Foreign Direct Investment than Nigeria, and Rwanda, a country with less than 15% of our mineral endowment, has an economy that is growing at twice the rate of our economy. The problem is not revenue. The challenge is not Nigerians. The issue is leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there is scant information in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework for what the loan would be used for, I could not help but read a communication from the Presidency to the effect that one of such projects would be the digitalisation of the Nigerian Television Authority and other similar projects.\n\nSpending revenue on such projects would be foolish, but spending loans in such a manner is nothing short of foolhardy. The Nigerian government does not have a good record of running businesses, and a public television network is unlikely to yield the type of income that would justify taking out loans to digitalise it. Besides, is that a priority, when we have 12 million children out of school? Like I said, capacity, not revenue, is the problem.\n\nAnd in proof of this, I offer the example of how this administration took delivery of $322 million Abacha loot in 2018 and claimed it shared it out to poor Nigerians, only to obtain a $328 million loan from China, allegedly for ICT development the very next month. How do you share out $322 million and then borrow $328 million? Who does that?\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself, it is clear that no amount of money, whether from revenue or borrowings, will be enough for an administration that lacks capacity.\n\nSo, what must Nigeria do now? Rather than profligate borrowing, what Nigeria needs to do is restore investor confidence in our economy. Key to that is respecting the independence of key institutions, such as the Judiciary and the Central Bank of Nigeria. Both of these institutions are now the captives of Buhari and his cabal, and though they are loathe to admit it, they cannot take one step without watching their backs.\n\nWhy are foreign investors leaving Nigeria for Ghana? The answer is that Ghana, unlike Nigeria, has learnt how to divorce key institutions from politics. The Ghanaian central bank enjoys a degree of independence that our own CBN can only dream of under the prevailing atmosphere. You will not hear Ghana\u2019s leaders give flippant interviews overseas about their plans for the cedi, as Buhari has done in Europe about the Naira. It rang alarm bells because it is not the job of the executive to interfere in the role of the reserve bank.\n\nNeither will you find Ghana\u2019s leaders blatantly intimidating the judiciary by obviously setting up judges and invading courtrooms. Why would any investor come to Nigeria under such prevailing circumstances? Their thought would be that if they had industrial disputes, our courts, under this administration, could not be counted on to deliver impartial justice.\n\nwas part of a team that paid off Nigeria\u2019s entire foreign debt. I, therefore, cannot sit and watch an administration without vision squander our children\u2019s future by taking and wasting loans that they do not even have the capacity to utilise properly.\n\nThank God for leaked memos that have exposed the lies this regime has told Nigerians about unprecedented revenues in the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Now, we know that Nigeria is not poor because she is not making enough money. The truth is that Nigeria is poor because she is not making the right leadership decisions.\n\nThomas Jefferson said, \u201cto preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.\u201d Dear citizens of our beloved nation, this is a call to heed. President Olusegun Obasanjo and I paid off this nation\u2019s debt, and I will not stand idly by and watch while Nigeria is plunged into second slavery by those who only know how to reap where they have not sown.\n\nOur youth must have something better to inherit from us than unsustainable debt fuelled by insatiable greed. That is why I call on the Senate of the National Assembly to show loyalty to Nigeria and reconsider its decision with regards to approving Buhari\u2019s $29.6 billion loan request.\n\nWe need to pay heed to Benjamin Franklin\u2019s advise that \u201che that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing\u201d. I call on Nigeria\u2019s youth to identify the Senator representing their senatorial zones and write to them, urging them to vote against this request. Do this, because it is you and your children that will pay back these loans that would be squandered by this ravenous cabal who do not have the word enough in their vocabulary.",

          "text": "In 2019, Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), raised the alarm over the accumulation of debts by the federal government.\n\nIn an opinion piece, Atiku warned the Muhammadu Buhari-led government that \u201cendless borrowing will lead to endless sorrowing\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal government released a four-month fiscal performance report for 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, the cost of servicing debt surpassed revenue by N310 billion in the first four months of 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report said the federal government\u2019s total revenue for the period was N1.63 trillion, while debt servicing gulped N1.94 trillion.\n\nZainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, called for urgent action to address revenue underperformance and expenditure efficiency at national and sub-national levels.\n\nATIKU\u2019S 2019 OPED\n\nJohn Quincy Adams once said \u201cthere are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.\u201d He may have very well been referring to Nigeria of the last three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarely two weeks ago, I warned during my Founder\u2019s Day lecture at the American University of Nigeria, Yola, that Nigeria had taken almost as much foreign debt in the last three years, as she had taken in the thirty years before 2015 combined. Now that is frightening. And very true.\n\nFrightening, not just because of the amount, but because after such unprecedented borrowing, we have emerged as the world headquarters for extreme poverty and the global capital for out of school children. It begs the question: what were the funds used for?\n\nI have said it time and again. The business of government is too serious to be left in the hands of politicians. We must all ask questions because if they throw away the future, it is not going to be their future they are throwing away, it will be all our futures.\n\nThe fact that Nigeria currently budgets more money for debt servicing (\u20a62.7 trillion), than we do on capital expenditure (\u20a62.4 trillion) is already an indicator that we have borrowed more money than we can afford to borrow. And the thing is that debt servicing is not debt repayment. Debt servicing just means that we are paying the barest minimum allowable by our creditors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while spending 50% of our current revenue on debt servicing, this administration wants to take further loans of $29.6 billion! To say that this is irresponsible is itself an understatement.\n\nAs a businessman, one of the very first things I learnt is that you do not take loans except you are expanding your business. Even as an individual, when your income cannot fund your lifestyle, you are challenged to grow your income, not your borrowings.\n\nEven if this administration borrows $1 trillion, it will never be enough because their challenge is one of capacity. They are not using the funds they already have wisely. They do not need more debt. They need more intellectual capacity.\n\nThe money the Muhammadu Buhari administration wants to borrow to fund its Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) could be acquired without sinking the nation into further debt. All it requires is visionary leadership and business acumen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my economic blueprint, I said that rather than turn in regular losses (which it has consistently been doing), the best thing to do with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation is to reform it. Of course, the administration\u2019s paid propagandists went into overdrive, accusing me of planning to sell the NNPC to my friends. But just last week, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ARAMCO, the most profitable company in the world, took that route and almost broke the global stock market with the most successful initial IPOs in world history, bar none. Ironically, Saudi Aramco raised $29.4 billion via this IPO. Just the amount this administration wants to borrow.\n\nThat could have been Nigeria\u2019s story, but for our failure of leadership. By reforming the NNPC, Nigeria can raise the $29.6 billion the Buhari regime wants to borrow, and we will raise the money without going into debt.\n\nIf we had taken that route, not only would we have attracted Foreign Direct Investment into Nigeria, but even better than investment, we would have attracted confidence in our economy, because it would have shown that we have a thinking leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the example of the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas company. This is a joint venture between the Nigeria government and the private sector. Yet, while the NLNG declares very handsome profits, in billions of dollars every year, the NNPC declares loses! This is proof that the NLNG model works, and the NNPC model does not.\n\nMoody\u2019s, the world\u2019s preeminent rating agency, has just downgraded Nigeria. Ghana, a nation with only 15% of our population, now attracts more Foreign Direct Investment than Nigeria, and Rwanda, a country with less than 15% of our mineral endowment, has an economy that is growing at twice the rate of our economy. The problem is not revenue. The challenge is not Nigerians. The issue is leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there is scant information in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework for what the loan would be used for, I could not help but read a communication from the Presidency to the effect that one of such projects would be the digitalisation of the Nigerian Television Authority and other similar projects.\n\nSpending revenue on such projects would be foolish, but spending loans in such a manner is nothing short of foolhardy. The Nigerian government does not have a good record of running businesses, and a public television network is unlikely to yield the type of income that would justify taking out loans to digitalise it. Besides, is that a priority, when we have 12 million children out of school? Like I said, capacity, not revenue, is the problem.\n\nAnd in proof of this, I offer the example of how this administration took delivery of $322 million Abacha loot in 2018 and claimed it shared it out to poor Nigerians, only to obtain a $328 million loan from China, allegedly for ICT development the very next month. How do you share out $322 million and then borrow $328 million? Who does that?\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself, it is clear that no amount of money, whether from revenue or borrowings, will be enough for an administration that lacks capacity.\n\nSo, what must Nigeria do now? Rather than profligate borrowing, what Nigeria needs to do is restore investor confidence in our economy. Key to that is respecting the independence of key institutions, such as the Judiciary and the Central Bank of Nigeria. Both of these institutions are now the captives of Buhari and his cabal, and though they are loathe to admit it, they cannot take one step without watching their backs.\n\nWhy are foreign investors leaving Nigeria for Ghana? The answer is that Ghana, unlike Nigeria, has learnt how to divorce key institutions from politics. The Ghanaian central bank enjoys a degree of independence that our own CBN can only dream of under the prevailing atmosphere. You will not hear Ghana\u2019s leaders give flippant interviews overseas about their plans for the cedi, as Buhari has done in Europe about the Naira. It rang alarm bells because it is not the job of the executive to interfere in the role of the reserve bank.\n\nNeither will you find Ghana\u2019s leaders blatantly intimidating the judiciary by obviously setting up judges and invading courtrooms. Why would any investor come to Nigeria under such prevailing circumstances? Their thought would be that if they had industrial disputes, our courts, under this administration, could not be counted on to deliver impartial justice.\n\nwas part of a team that paid off Nigeria\u2019s entire foreign debt. I, therefore, cannot sit and watch an administration without vision squander our children\u2019s future by taking and wasting loans that they do not even have the capacity to utilise properly.\n\nThank God for leaked memos that have exposed the lies this regime has told Nigerians about unprecedented revenues in the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. Now, we know that Nigeria is not poor because she is not making enough money. The truth is that Nigeria is poor because she is not making the right leadership decisions.\n\nThomas Jefferson said, \u201cto preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.\u201d Dear citizens of our beloved nation, this is a call to heed. President Olusegun Obasanjo and I paid off this nation\u2019s debt, and I will not stand idly by and watch while Nigeria is plunged into second slavery by those who only know how to reap where they have not sown.\n\nOur youth must have something better to inherit from us than unsustainable debt fuelled by insatiable greed. That is why I call on the Senate of the National Assembly to show loyalty to Nigeria and reconsider its decision with regards to approving Buhari\u2019s $29.6 billion loan request.\n\nWe need to pay heed to Benjamin Franklin\u2019s advise that \u201che that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing\u201d. I call on Nigeria\u2019s youth to identify the Senator representing their senatorial zones and write to them, urging them to vote against this request. Do this, because it is you and your children that will pay back these loans that would be squandered by this ravenous cabal who do not have the word enough in their vocabulary.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Hannah Subayi believes the gap between Anglophone and Francophone African startups is reducing",
          "text": "Hannah Subayi Kamuanga\u2019s passion for investing is evident in the many hats she wears as a foremost investor in the African tech ecosystem.\n\nShe\u2019s currently the country manager for development finance institution Propaco in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a board member of the African Business Angel Network, and a partner at Dazzle Angels, a female-focused angel fund. She\u2019s also an investment committee member in 2 pan-African investment funds: Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures.\n\nPrior to her taking up these roles, she spent 7 years at South Suez Capital, an African private equity fund, and 2 years at the Switzerland-headquartered financial services company, Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cI love to find, identify talent, provide capital, and see talent grow to create something out of the business, see it grow over time,\u201d Subayi shared with TechCabal over a call. \u201cInvesting in companies allows me to combine my data crunching technical skills and legal skills, such as poring over legal briefs or policy documents, while redefining the future of Africa one investment at a time.\u201d\n\nTechCabal sat down with Subayi to learn more about her experience and life as an African investor.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What does investing mean to you?\n\nHannah Subayi: Investing is really about identifying talent, whether it\u2019s a startup, a large business, or a team of promoters trying to set up infrastructure projects. You assess funding needs, structure a deal, invest and monitor the investments. This turns out to have a massive impact in Africa, which I\u2019m very passionate about, and then obviously, you make money while at it.\n\nCurrently, as Propaco\u2019s country officer in DRC, which is a frontier market, I have the opportunity to invest through the entire spectrum of different projects from infrastructure financing, down to early-stage startups. Without any conflict, I also advise Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures, which is the most active fund on the continent with 90% of our founders being local African founders and 25% of them being female.\n\nAs an investor, I\u2019d like to ensure that founders in markets like DRC and Madagascar are also getting the funding that they need from institutional investors.\n\nPersonally, I have set up a new investment club here in the DRC. In March, we did our first seed investment in a local Congolese company manufacturing and distributing industrial cleaning products such as soaps and toothpaste, which are made from local African products like palm oil.\n\nThis investment is a big deal for us because DRC is a typical African country where about 80\u201390% of our products are actually imported. We don\u2019t have any active industries outside of the mining industry. One of our mission statements as an investment club is that we\u2019re going to support local companies that\u2019ll turn out to become as big as Africa\u2019s leading industrial conglomerate, Dangote, and help industrialise the economy in DRC.\n\nDA: What has the transition from private equity to angel investing and venture capital been like?\n\nHS: As an investor, I\u2019m quite passionate about reinventing myself. Every 3\u20134 years I discover new industries, new financial instruments, and products. I started out investing through private equity in Africa for a few years; this prepared me as I built my own personal wealth to become an angel investor to back the next wave of entrepreneurs.\n\nI started Dazzle Angels angels back in 2019, right after investing for many years through private equity. I think my experience as an angel investor led me to become more passionate about startups and early-stage investments. And with many investment clubs behaving more like VC firms, despite not having the same technical skills, network and funds, it\u2019s natural that many angel investors move over to become VC investors.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in startups you want to invest in?\n\nHS: For me, I really like to focus on the team, focusing on their consistency and ability to deliver, as well as their resilience, because I think it\u2019s really important in Africa to be resilient.\n\nI ask questions such as do I like the business? Do I understand what they do? Do I feel like there is a prospect for growth and profitability? How disruptive are businesses or what type of impact do they have on the ground?\n\nWhat is the execution risk? Personally, when I look at an investment opportunity I think of how I can mitigate all of those risks. Obviously, you have to consider the competitive dynamics of the sector and the regulatory environment. But again, with the right team and the right business model, you can navigate those things pretty easily.\n\nIn addition, the deal structure is important because you need to make sure that you\u2019re providing the right amount of funding.\n\nDA: What red flags do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nHS: Personally, it\u2019s always down to the people. For me, a red flag is when the entrepreneur is not completely committed or convinced by his business, his venture\u2014if he\u2019s running 4 or 5 other projects.\n\nThe next has to do with the deal terms, which is also a reflection of the team. I think as an investor if you\u2019re not comfortable with the deal terms, and you feel that the entrepreneur is asking for a valuation that\u2019s too high or asking for terms that are too negative for you, then it\u2019s something you might want to walk away from.\n\nFor example, there have been instances when entrepreneurs that don\u2019t have a turnover or make less than $5,000\u201310,000 per month state that their valuation is $5 or $10 million. I often reply by telling them that\u2019s not how it works. These unreasonable expectations are reflected in the terms of the percentage founders offer investors. This also comes up when founders expect investors to make too many business introductions for them. Obviously, as an investor, you\u2019re to make a few introductions but not to become the commercial director.\n\nSo already during the due diligence phase, if you hear that the entrepreneurs are asking for many things like commercial introductions that you can\u2019t deliver, then I think you should walk away, and vice versa.\n\nDA: Can you share an overview of what investing in the different regions of Africa look like?\n\nHS: The difference between regions in Africa is a reflection of the economic and social development history. As you know anglophone Africa tends to be a bit more advanced than Arab-speaking and francophone Africa.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak too much about lusophone Africa\u2014Portuguese-speaking countries\u2014even though I\u2019ve made an investment in a startup in Mozambique because I think these are frontier markets with a different language, which are not that connected to the rest of the continent.\n\nNevertheless, we noticed that in all the 3 main regions\u2014anglophone, Arab-speaking, and francophone\u2014we see more and more local institutional funders being active with the right technical skills and willingness to back local champions, which is very optimistic.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an improvement in the regulatory environment. More startup investment clubs are being supported by local governments. We see universities putting in place structures to assist students who want to create their own startups. We see VC firms being more active at the seed level, series A, and other levels. Generally speaking on the continent, there is still a lack of sufficient pre-seed funding, which typically is taken care of by the government.\n\nThe quality of companies is increasing everywhere. I\u2019m always happy to demonstrate that even in francophone Africa, you\u2019ll find 5 founders and startups who have better metrics in terms of turnover, number of users, and profitability than in Anglophone Africa.\n\nHowever, we cannot deny that the operational environment remains a bit tougher to some extent in francophone Africa. So, obviously, if you\u2019re a founder in one of these francophone markets, compared to someone who might be in South Africa, or Egypt, you\u2019ll struggle a bit more and the pace at which your business grows is not the same.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an increase in intra-Africa transactions. So, we see more North African investors who are trying to get into anglophone Africa. We see more anglophone African investors trying to invest in francophone Africa. So it\u2019s very exciting to be alive at this time when investors and startups are operating across different regions.\n\nPart of the reason why this is happening is that there are more investors just like me who have worked and studied across different regions, enabling them to understand the different contexts and navigate them better. We have more African investors who are well-rounded in terms of understanding the different ecosystems and we see an increase in investment into the 3 regions, and hopefully, francophone Africa will continue to catch up.\n\nDA: Anything more, especially about the francophone Africa space?\n\nHS: Historically, francophone Africa, just by virtue of the language, mainly only looked to France for funding and expansion. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case anymore.\n\nIf you look at startups, like Wave, you can see that most of the funding came from the US and other international investors. If you look at francophone African startups, they are incorporated in Paris but that\u2019s not any different from other startups that are incorporated in Delaware.\n\nIrrespective of where startups are incorporated, I think that there\u2019s some uniformity around standard practices and strategies of startups in the continent, which also explains why we see an uptick in investments for Africa. There\u2019s a similarity in the way entrepreneurs think about their growth and expansion and how they talk to investors, which is literally what you want because you want to make sure that everybody\u2019s playing on an equal field and to make sure that startups are receiving the right level of funding.\n\nDA: What\u2019s it like being a female investor?\n\nHS: I think there are many features in my profile that some people might interpret in a good or negative way, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about positioning. It\u2019s all about being consistent in terms of who you are as an investor, what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and connecting with the right type of opportunities.\n\nAs a female investor in francophone Africa, I haven\u2019t really felt potentially discriminated against because I\u2019ve worked with entrepreneurs who respect me. Typically, if you demonstrate that you have the right technical skills, the right network, and are a nice person, people will work with you.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to managing our careers or raising funds, it might be more challenging for female investors. But it\u2019s a representation of the issues that female professionals face in all industries. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the worst in the investment space.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding what you can bring to the table and adapting your strategy to suit the person you\u2019re dealing with. Also, at the end of the day, as an investor, you also have to walk away from situations and opportunities that are clearly not capable or willing to work with you.\n\nDA: How do you spend your time? What does a typical day look like?\n\nHS: When I look at all the great African investors like Mariame Diop, Zachariah George, or Tomi Davies who are doing much more than I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s always humbling.\n\nManaging Propaco in DRC takes most of my time, attending investor committees, talking to CEOs of large companies and startups to talk about due diligence processes monitoring, investment, doing site visits, as well as here in DRC. I also occasionally deal with lawyers to be sure the legal documentation is correct or dealing with litigation.\n\nI do all of this and attend social events like seminars and conferences. We don\u2019t talk enough about that because as an investor, it\u2019s quite important to be well connected to your business community, whether it\u2019s other investors or entrepreneurs.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nHS: When we started Launch Venture Africa last year, we were investing in startups with no revenue but now it\u2019s difficult for us to look at a startup that\u2019s not generating at least $20,000. That\u2019s how competitive the market has become.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more investments between various financial institutions. We\u2019re seeing more synergies between investment clubs, and there are new structures that are put in place that are a mix of investment clubs and VC funds, like Future Africa and Dakar Network Angels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "\u201cI remember walking on the streets of Lagos, telling God, \u2018Is this how my life will be? Is this it?\u2019 I was thinking, \u2018How do people get over poverty?\u2019\u201d\n\nWho would have thought that Oluchi Enebeli, Nigeria\u2019s first female blockchain engineer, once asked herself, \u201cHow do people get over poverty.\u201d One look at the Dubai-based blockchain engineer, and you\u2019d find it hard to believe that there was a time she worried about where to lay her head for the night.\n\nBut as she fought through tears to tell the story of how she became one of the most sought-after blockchain engineers in the country, I could tell that this wasn\u2019t your typical tech bro/sis story.\n\nOluchi Enebeli\n\nFrom people\u2019s perceptions of the phrase \u2018tech bro\u2019, it can be inferred that the tech industry is a desirable place to forge a career, with many seeing it as the new oil and where the money flows. From people bragging about million-dollar salaries on Twitter to fundraising announcements every other day, there is no denying there\u2019s money in tech.\n\nHowever, beyond the glitz and glamour of social media, there is a special breed of techies who have fought tooth and nail to become exceptional in their fields, and one of them is Oluchi Enebeli.\n\nOluchi Enebeli, the second of seven children, was born in Lagos, Nigeria, but her family moved around a lot because her father was in the military. Some of her fondest childhood memories are of Warri, the commercial capital city of Delta State, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMy dad was in the military and was always being transferred from one place to another, which affected our studies. I was homeschooled, and my dad was teaching me.\n\n\u201cHe mostly taught maths because he had this idea that if you know maths, you know, everything else was in the world. Like, you can pass biology without studying. It\u2019s crazy, but that\u2019s the mindset my dad had. He taught us with a math textbook he had written, and my job was to solve the examples in the textbook and then come up with answers.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Enebeli got her love for mathematics from her father and went on to study applied mathematics at the University of Benin, or Unibend as it is jocularly called when referencing how strenuous it is to graduate from university.\n\n\u201cWe used to call it uni-bend then because when you come in, you\u2019re straight and then it keeps bending you till it finally bends you completely when you get to your final year. So that\u2019s why we used to call it uni bending school.\u201d\n\nDiscovering tech\n\nEnebeli discovered tech and knew she\u2019d like to be in the space someday. However, she decided to study applied mathematics instead of something tech-related because she concluded she could learn tech without going to school.\n\n\u201cThe reason I studied applied mathematics is quite funny. Growing up, my dad had a cybercafe that my elder brother managed, and when it was time for him to go to school, I was next in line to run the cafe.\n\n\u201cI had no idea how to run a cybercafe and knew nothing about computers. I was in SS2 at the time, and all we were taught about computers in school was theoretical. We rarely used the computer, and even when we did, we would form a queue and take turns to use it briefly because the school had just one.\n\n\u201cWith time, I learnt about the whole computer thing, but I noticed many people wanted to know about computers, and they were mainly learning desktop publishing and graphic design. People were going to computer schools to study these things.\n\n\u201cEven my elder brother went on to study computer science in the university. I felt, \u2018If this is all there is to it, why do I need to go to the university to study it?\u2019 So the plan was to learn something more worthwhile in school and learn computer science on the street \u2018cause I saw a lot of people learning it everywhere.\u201d\n\nLearning something more worthwhile in school meant studying applied mathematics. Enebeli\u2019s dad, a Mathematician, was particularly delighted that he had a child following his footsteps, but they had no inkling that while it seemed like she was on the path to becoming a mathematician, what the future held was completely different.\n\nEnebeli was excited about school in her first year at Unibend, and while she wasn\u2019t a social butterfly, she was popular with the nerds who constantly talked about assignments and tests.\n\nAnd she was on fire, too, getting first-class grades from the get-go. From the picture she painted as she excitedly told me about her time in school, she hopped from one nerd gathering to the next, impacting people and soaking up as much information as possible.\n\n\u201cSo when I got into 100 level, I became very social, but a social nerd; I was social academically, but was not the kind who went to parties. I would always help my classmates figure out solutions to assignments. I was everywhere; you would see me in this night class and that library. So that was like the social part of me.\u201d\n\nShe kept smashing academic records until she got to the third year, when she battled illnesses, and her results took a hit.\n\nA first-class mission\n\nOluchi\u2019s first international travel for a hackathon in New York\n\nGraduating with a first class was necessary for two reasons: she had to measure up to the standard her brother set, and her family needed it.\n\n\u201cWe needed to make a first-class because of our family. I am from a family of seven, my dad was in the military, and the pay wasn\u2019t so great. The financial struggles were real, so that was like one pressure on me when I went into school.\u201d\n\nWhile Enebeli worked as hard as she could in her fourth year to make a first-class, it just didn\u2019t work out. She was devastated; according to her, she was too ashamed to go back home.\n\nShe had let her father down; she had let her siblings down.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to come out with the first class, but I did not, and I almost killed myself.\u201d\n\nOluchi admitted that suicidal thoughts crossed her mind during this time. Her brother, who graduated with a first-class, also won a \u20a65 million ($8,130) scholarship, which was great for the family. That was supposed to be her story too, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe shame from going home would have been too much to bear, so she decided to stay in school. It turned out to be the best decision she\u2019d ever made, as she could see things from a different perspective.\n\nEnebeli realised there was more to tech than desktop publishing and graphic design. Surprised she did not notice before, she learnt that the unserious students who barely came to class because they were doing tech jobs on the side were onto something big. That was all she needed, it was her proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, and she said,\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get the first class in school [but that] doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t get the first class in life.\u201d\n\nWhen she discovered that the unserious students who frequently juggled software engineering with their studentship were building valuable experience and connections, she decided to tap into the lifestyle.\n\nWhile having a tech job and still being in school is commonplace now, it wasn\u2019t when Enebeli went to school.\n\n\u201cSo, a coursemate of mine back then was into networking. He was taking networking classes, working and schooling simultaneously, but I didn\u2019t know that was even possible. At the time, it wasn\u2019t common; now, you have a lot of people working and schooling simultaneously.\u201d\n\nShe transitioned mentally and started networking classes to get the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification.\n\nAt this point, she knew where her life was headed and could go home. With a silver lining in her second-class upper cloud, she could finally drop the bomb on her family.\n\nBut Enebeli\u2019s dad had plans that didn\u2019t involve getting IT certifications. She had already broken his heart by not getting a first class and was about to do it again by not doing what he wanted.\n\nHe\u2019d planned for her to run his electronics store during her National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), so he could leverage his connections to get her a job in an oil company.\n\nEnebeli was sure that tech was the right path for her, and not even her father could change her mind. She was prepared to pursue tech with every fibre of her being, even if nobody was willing to help.\n\nTech is hard\n\nOn Tuesday, March 1, 2016, Enebeli left Warri for Lagos \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s Silicon Valley \u2014 to pursue her tech dreams alone.\n\nThough she was born in Lagos, she barely knew anyone in the city because she\u2019d only lived there briefly. So living and networking arrangements were difficult, but she didn\u2019t care. The plan was to get an internship as soon as she arrived, save enough money to take her CCNA exams, and be on her way to tech stardom.\n\nUnfortunately, internships weren\u2019t easy to come by and requesting financial support from home was not an option, mainly because she left without her father\u2019s blessing and the family needed financial support.\n\nThe longer she stayed without an internship, the harder it was.\n\n\u201cWhy would no one take a chance on me?\u201d She wondered.\n\nRecollecting these times was difficult for her, and even with my poor Internet connection, I could hear the pain in her voice.\n\n\u201cI was moving from place to place trying to get people to stay with; it was a funny story.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t funny. From failing to graduate with a first-class degree to getting turned down everywhere she turned, nothing was funny about her situation; she almost lost the will to go on at some point.\n\n\u201cI remember walking on the streets of Lagos, telling God, \u2018Is this how my life will be? Is this it?\u2019 I was thinking, \u2018How do people get over poverty?\u2019 It was a struggle at that point. You know that situation where there\u2019s absolutely no one, no connections.\n\n\u201cIt gets you thinking about people born in slums without a fighting chance, looking around you, and you can\u2019t find something remotely resembling hope.\n\n\u201cHope; hope is important.\u201d\n\nAnd hope helped her stay strong. When no one would take a chance on her, she decided to learn about WordPress at a fellowship she\u2019d been attending in hope that it would get her the internship she desperately needed.\n\nAnd she finally got one.\n\nCrenet Tech Labs decided to take a chance on her, and she remains grateful to its Founder, Adegbenga Agoro, for that first opportunity. Besides getting money that made survival easier, getting that internship reassured her that she was doing the right thing. It was an incredible learning experience that led to her discovery of blockchain technology.\n\nDiscovering blockchain\n\nOluchi during her internship at Crenet Labs\n\nDuring her internship, she participated in a hackathon introducing her to another tech side called the blockchain. While she liked it, she found it overwhelming because she was still trying to figure the whole tech thing out.\n\nHowever, her curiosity was piqued. Its decentralised nature and the concept of cryptography appealed to her. And just like that, her applied mathematics degree was useful.\n\nI was like, how does this thing work? How is there a decentralised network where information is shared across multiple nodes?\n\nBlockchain was still new, and very few people knew about it. She figured that getting into the space early before it got saturated would increase her chances of success.\n\nWhen she started learning blockchain\n\nShe started learning a lot about blockchain and went for more hackathons, one for which she travelled to Manhattan, USA, where she met Eromosele Omomhenle, then Principal Technology Strategist at Microsoft.\n\nThrough this connection, she landed a blockchain engineer role at Sterling Bank, and she only went up from there.\n\nShe has worked with some of the biggest blockchain companies in the world, including Binance, Crypto.com, Bundle, and recently launched Nestcoin.\n\nEnebeli has gone from an intern earning \u20a635,000 ($56) monthly to commanding a seven-figure salary. She\u2019s also now the Co-founder of Crevatal, a Web3 design agency, and Web3 Ladies, a community she created to bring more women into the space.\n\nEnebeli owes her success to her parents, siblings, Clement Hugbo \u2014 her co-founder at Crevatal \u2014 and everyone that took a chance on her.\n\nShe, however, maintains that everyone is the architect of their future, and every decision we make based on advice, our will, or under pressure does not matter because, in the end, you decide what happens to you.",

          "title": "Nigerian fintechs grapple with KYC amid rapid growth",
          "text": "Nigerian financial technology companies are grappling with the aftermath of a Kenyan court account freeze order and a decision by a Texas court to jail the founders of Ping Express over money laundering.\n\nThe charges against the four fintech companies are the most money laundering allegations the fintech ecosystem in Nigeria has seen in a month and could have ramifications for the image of startups in the country looking for investors abroad.\n\nExperts say that henceforth many startups will be compelled to focus on strengthening lax Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) practices.\n\nKYC refers to due diligence that banks and other financial institutions must perform on their customers before doing business with them to prevent corruption, identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering and terrorism financing, according to Fraud.net.\n\n\u201cAML and KYC requirements are more or less the same globally. I however opine that with the many finance and technology innovations, they should be reviewed and scope broadened to include all emerging, and continuously emerging innovations,\u201d said Evalyn Gachoki, a fintech law practitioner.\n\nWhile Anslem Oshionebo and Opeyemi Odeyale, Nigerian founders of Ping Express, a Texas-based fintech company, pleaded guilty on Saturday to failing to adequately guard against money laundering in a court in the Northern District of Texas, Flutterwave, Korapay, and Kandor are battling for access to their accounts frozen by the Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) of Kenya.\n\nFlutterwave is the most affected, with 56 accounts it has with Guaranty Trust Bank (29 accounts), Equity Bank (17), and Ecobank (six) all frozen. The 56 accounts held about $56 million.\n\nKorapay Technologies had one of its accounts with $249,565 frozen, while two accounts worth a combined $126,841 belonging to Kandor Technologies also suffered the same fate.\n\nAlthough the tech companies insist that they followed due process and every KYC practice, experts say cases of money laundering usually happen because someone may have ignored KYC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d argue poor KYC exposes them to fraud and non-compliance on AML,\u201d said Victoria Crandal, a tech PR expert and founder of No Filter PR. \u201cFintechs prioritise growth and user experience and KYC becomes an after-thought. This partly explains the fraud within MTN\u2019s PSB and possibly FW (Flutterwave) alleged AML problems in Kenya.\u201d\n\nVictor Asemota, chairman of Edo Innovates, has a slightly different opinion. According to him, KYC is not a fintech problem because the government owns identification. Since fintechs do not control identification, they have to prioritise KYC.\n\n\u201cWe have helped MTN do AML on their mobile payments platforms for a decade. They take it extremely seriously; same with Flutterwave. Misunderstanding by regulators of settlement occurs. Tech glitches are a reality,\u201d Asemota said.\n\nOther experts say anti-money laundering issues arise when tech startups try to outsmart the regulator. For example, merchant transactions are facilitated through merchant category codes (MCC).\n\nAn MCC is a four-digit number used by credit card companies to classify businesses. A business that sells both services and products will typically reflect the business type that makes up the dominant amount of sales. Businesses can request additional MCC for a different part of a business. For example, a pharmaceutical store that has a grocery store in one location would likely have different MCCs within the same building.\n\nEvery merchant has a unique ID and every transaction has a code. There are codes that when merchants are initiating transactions, they raise a red flag, like gambling, and pornography. Usually, the Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) is supposed to know when a merchant is making a particular transaction.\n\nHowever, there are cases of abuse. Merchants that want to help people move funds would simply change the code from which the transaction is originating and use another code that diverts attention. While some companies often get away with it, others do not.\n\nThe anti-money laundering policy is usually strong in many countries including Nigeria where the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit is in charge of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism; however, there are jurisdictions where the enforcement is stricter.\n\nKenya happens to be one of them, according to several people knowledgeable about the issue. Patrick Ngugi Njoroge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, said at a conference organised by Visa in April that the country was intensifying compliance as part of measures to strengthen the financial system of the country.\n\nThe country, in September 2021, gazetted the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-money Laundering Bill, which seeks to amend the current Proceeds of Crime and Anti-money Laundering Act, 2009.\n\nThe bill expands the definition of \u201creporting persons\u201d under the Act. This will now include advocates, notaries, and other independent legal professionals who are sole practitioners, partners, or employees within professional firms so that the obligations to monitor complex unusual, suspicious, large, or other transactions and to report any transactions that constitute or may be related to money laundering as provided under Part IV of the Act apply to them.\n\nThe bill also seeks to give the centre the authority to interrupt a transaction for not more than five working days where there is evidence of suspicious activity taking place. This will allow the centre adequate time to investigate the transaction.\n\nThe bill also seeks to introduce provisions that will limit the right to privacy enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 in relation to the prevention, detection, and investigation of money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\nAccording to a legal compliance professional who spoke to BusinessDay on condition of anonymity, the existing Kenyan anti-money laundering law allows ARA to hold on to the funds in the frozen accounts pending when it has concluded investigations. This could mean 45 days at the lower court and 90 days at the higher court.\n\n\u201cThis whole area is confusing, to be honest. The startups are not entirely guilt-free. But it\u2019s not as simple as Nigerian founders doing fraud. They are not that stupid. The reality is there are a lot of loopholes in corridors outside of their control. KYC is set by the government mostly.\n\nBVN, NIN, and ID cards all come from the government. If the government doesn\u2019t tighten up its process, people will take advantage and the result will reflect on the fintechs processing value,\u201d said Henry Ojuor, founder in residence with Startupbootcamp, a global startup and innovation accelerator for startups, corporates, and governments.\n\nRead also: How to Leverage Happy Customers to Promote Your Brand\n\nA tech expert who wants to remain anonymous, told BusinessDay that enforcement often depends on the regulatory focus of the jurisdiction in cross-border payments.\n\n\u201cDespite the strides achieved by Nigerian fintech firms, you can hardly get public data on their activities from the CBN or NIBSS.\n\nThe incentives driving Nigerian fintechs, and possible lax domestic regulations, may not be tolerated in jurisdictions that are strict. The allegation against the affected firms is not unique to Nigerian fintech, and dare I say, not borne out of envy,\u201d the expert said.\n\nWhile the companies continue to proclaim their innocence, a bigger challenge they face is how to access the funds in those accounts.\n\nFor companies like Flutterwave, the more days the funds spend in ARA\u2019s custody, the worse the anger of merchants they have to deal with.\n\n\u201cThese funds do not belong to these companies. They are given to them by merchants, and there is a limit to how long a patient can be patient with you,\u201d the compliance officer said.\n\nKandon Technologies, in its statement, described itself as a liquidity management startup offering treasury solutions, alternative trading, and related financial services. The company said it has facilitated transactions for a host of its partners doing legitimate businesses and it has records of these transactions, which are available and can be verified.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have always adhered to applicable regulatory requirements in our transactions and engaged with regulatory bodies to stay compliant,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe pledge to continue working with regulatory bodies and all relevant stakeholders to prove our innocence and straighten the records.\u201d\n\nKorapay, on its part, said it deposited the funds in its freshly opened bank account as a capital requirement from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) for obtaining a payment service provider and remittance operator licence. In line with the CBK requirements, this amount was left untouched pending the granting of the licence. The company claimed that the $250,000 deposit is the only transaction carried out on that account to date.\n\nOne of the options being explored by the companies includes filing a legal action asking the court to compel ARA to put the funds in accounts or assets that yield interest and allow them access to the interest to enable them to fulfill their obligations to their merchants.\n\nEvalyn Gachoki said government agencies like ARA need to engage fintech experts, regulators, and stakeholders towards identifying gaps, if any.\n\n\u201cAnti-money laundering laws were created way before fintech was birthed. The laws should be reviewed to incorporate the many solutions technology has introduced into finance,\u201d Gachoki said.",

          "title": "Nigerian fintechs grapple with KYC amid rapid growth",
          "text": "Nigerian financial technology companies are grappling with the aftermath of a Kenyan court account freeze order and a decision by a Texas court to jail the founders of Ping Express over money laundering.\n\nThe charges against the four fintech companies are the most money laundering allegations the fintech ecosystem in Nigeria has seen in a month and could have ramifications for the image of startups in the country looking for investors abroad.\n\nExperts say that henceforth many startups will be compelled to focus on strengthening lax Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) practices.\n\nKYC refers to due diligence that banks and other financial institutions must perform on their customers before doing business with them to prevent corruption, identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering and terrorism financing, according to Fraud.net.\n\n\u201cAML and KYC requirements are more or less the same globally. I however opine that with the many finance and technology innovations, they should be reviewed and scope broadened to include all emerging, and continuously emerging innovations,\u201d said Evalyn Gachoki, a fintech law practitioner.\n\nWhile Anslem Oshionebo and Opeyemi Odeyale, Nigerian founders of Ping Express, a Texas-based fintech company, pleaded guilty on Saturday to failing to adequately guard against money laundering in a court in the Northern District of Texas, Flutterwave, Korapay, and Kandor are battling for access to their accounts frozen by the Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) of Kenya.\n\nFlutterwave is the most affected, with 56 accounts it has with Guaranty Trust Bank (29 accounts), Equity Bank (17), and Ecobank (six) all frozen. The 56 accounts held about $56 million.\n\nKorapay Technologies had one of its accounts with $249,565 frozen, while two accounts worth a combined $126,841 belonging to Kandor Technologies also suffered the same fate.\n\nAlthough the tech companies insist that they followed due process and every KYC practice, experts say cases of money laundering usually happen because someone may have ignored KYC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d argue poor KYC exposes them to fraud and non-compliance on AML,\u201d said Victoria Crandal, a tech PR expert and founder of No Filter PR. \u201cFintechs prioritise growth and user experience and KYC becomes an after-thought. This partly explains the fraud within MTN\u2019s PSB and possibly FW (Flutterwave) alleged AML problems in Kenya.\u201d\n\nVictor Asemota, chairman of Edo Innovates, has a slightly different opinion. According to him, KYC is not a fintech problem because the government owns identification. Since fintechs do not control identification, they have to prioritise KYC.\n\n\u201cWe have helped MTN do AML on their mobile payments platforms for a decade. They take it extremely seriously; same with Flutterwave. Misunderstanding by regulators of settlement occurs. Tech glitches are a reality,\u201d Asemota said.\n\nOther experts say anti-money laundering issues arise when tech startups try to outsmart the regulator. For example, merchant transactions are facilitated through merchant category codes (MCC).\n\nAn MCC is a four-digit number used by credit card companies to classify businesses. A business that sells both services and products will typically reflect the business type that makes up the dominant amount of sales. Businesses can request additional MCC for a different part of a business. For example, a pharmaceutical store that has a grocery store in one location would likely have different MCCs within the same building.\n\nEvery merchant has a unique ID and every transaction has a code. There are codes that when merchants are initiating transactions, they raise a red flag, like gambling, and pornography. Usually, the Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) is supposed to know when a merchant is making a particular transaction.\n\nHowever, there are cases of abuse. Merchants that want to help people move funds would simply change the code from which the transaction is originating and use another code that diverts attention. While some companies often get away with it, others do not.\n\nThe anti-money laundering policy is usually strong in many countries including Nigeria where the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit is in charge of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism; however, there are jurisdictions where the enforcement is stricter.\n\nKenya happens to be one of them, according to several people knowledgeable about the issue. Patrick Ngugi Njoroge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, said at a conference organised by Visa in April that the country was intensifying compliance as part of measures to strengthen the financial system of the country.\n\nThe country, in September 2021, gazetted the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-money Laundering Bill, which seeks to amend the current Proceeds of Crime and Anti-money Laundering Act, 2009.\n\nThe bill expands the definition of \u201creporting persons\u201d under the Act. This will now include advocates, notaries, and other independent legal professionals who are sole practitioners, partners, or employees within professional firms so that the obligations to monitor complex unusual, suspicious, large, or other transactions and to report any transactions that constitute or may be related to money laundering as provided under Part IV of the Act apply to them.\n\nThe bill also seeks to give the centre the authority to interrupt a transaction for not more than five working days where there is evidence of suspicious activity taking place. This will allow the centre adequate time to investigate the transaction.\n\nThe bill also seeks to introduce provisions that will limit the right to privacy enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 in relation to the prevention, detection, and investigation of money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\nAccording to a legal compliance professional who spoke to BusinessDay on condition of anonymity, the existing Kenyan anti-money laundering law allows ARA to hold on to the funds in the frozen accounts pending when it has concluded investigations. This could mean 45 days at the lower court and 90 days at the higher court.\n\n\u201cThis whole area is confusing, to be honest. The startups are not entirely guilt-free. But it\u2019s not as simple as Nigerian founders doing fraud. They are not that stupid. The reality is there are a lot of loopholes in corridors outside of their control. KYC is set by the government mostly.\n\nBVN, NIN, and ID cards all come from the government. If the government doesn\u2019t tighten up its process, people will take advantage and the result will reflect on the fintechs processing value,\u201d said Henry Ojuor, founder in residence with Startupbootcamp, a global startup and innovation accelerator for startups, corporates, and governments.\n\nRead also: How to Leverage Happy Customers to Promote Your Brand\n\nA tech expert who wants to remain anonymous, told BusinessDay that enforcement often depends on the regulatory focus of the jurisdiction in cross-border payments.\n\n\u201cDespite the strides achieved by Nigerian fintech firms, you can hardly get public data on their activities from the CBN or NIBSS.\n\nThe incentives driving Nigerian fintechs, and possible lax domestic regulations, may not be tolerated in jurisdictions that are strict. The allegation against the affected firms is not unique to Nigerian fintech, and dare I say, not borne out of envy,\u201d the expert said.\n\nWhile the companies continue to proclaim their innocence, a bigger challenge they face is how to access the funds in those accounts.\n\nFor companies like Flutterwave, the more days the funds spend in ARA\u2019s custody, the worse the anger of merchants they have to deal with.\n\n\u201cThese funds do not belong to these companies. They are given to them by merchants, and there is a limit to how long a patient can be patient with you,\u201d the compliance officer said.\n\nKandon Technologies, in its statement, described itself as a liquidity management startup offering treasury solutions, alternative trading, and related financial services. The company said it has facilitated transactions for a host of its partners doing legitimate businesses and it has records of these transactions, which are available and can be verified.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have always adhered to applicable regulatory requirements in our transactions and engaged with regulatory bodies to stay compliant,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe pledge to continue working with regulatory bodies and all relevant stakeholders to prove our innocence and straighten the records.\u201d\n\nKorapay, on its part, said it deposited the funds in its freshly opened bank account as a capital requirement from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) for obtaining a payment service provider and remittance operator licence. In line with the CBK requirements, this amount was left untouched pending the granting of the licence. The company claimed that the $250,000 deposit is the only transaction carried out on that account to date.\n\nOne of the options being explored by the companies includes filing a legal action asking the court to compel ARA to put the funds in accounts or assets that yield interest and allow them access to the interest to enable them to fulfill their obligations to their merchants.\n\nEvalyn Gachoki said government agencies like ARA need to engage fintech experts, regulators, and stakeholders towards identifying gaps, if any.\n\n\u201cAnti-money laundering laws were created way before fintech was birthed. The laws should be reviewed to incorporate the many solutions technology has introduced into finance,\u201d Gachoki said.",

          "title": "Obaseki and Senate Bill to allow States Generate, distribute Electricity \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIn June 2017, Governor Godwin Obaseki announced to the world that in six month\u2019s time, his administration would provide uninterrupted power supply to B\u00e9nin City and environs. According to his plans, government establishments on Sapele Road axis, including Government House, Secretariat, Court Complex, Central hospital, House of Assembly and also the Oba of B\u00e9nin Palace, will enjoy the 24 hours power supply.\n\nObaseki was quite assured that he would deliver on his promise in record time. He gave the assurance after he entered a power purchase agreement with Ossiomo Power and Infrastructure to bulk purchase the five megawatts the firm planned to generate from its 50 megawatts plant at Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha local government area which BEDC has frustrated. The megawatts was expected to be transmitted on a new 35-kilometre double circuit 33Kva line to deliver 24/7 uninterrupted power.\n\nThe senate has passed the electricity bill 2022 that would allow states to generate and distribute power as well as solve the sector\u2019s challenges. The bill was passed recently after the consideration of a report by the senate committee on power.\n\nGabriel Suswam, chairman of the committee, said the bill sought to provide an ideal legal and institutional framework to leverage the modest gains of the privatisation phase of the electric power sector in Nigeria. Suswam said that it would minimise aggregate value chain losses in the sector when signed into law. He also said there is no need for anyone or firm generating electricity below one megawatt to get a licence, adding that the new law would allow states or individuals with capacities to generate their power.\n\n\u201cSince electricity is on the concurrent list in the constitution, the bill has allowed state governments to license people who intend to operate mini-grids within the states,\u201d he said. According to the lawmaker, the piece of legislation will reinvigorate the institutional framework for the reform of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) initiated and implemented by the federal government.\n\nAhmad Lawan, president of the senate, midway through consideration of the bill, sought to know the role and operational capacity of banks that had taken over Distribution Companies (DISCOs) indebted to them. Responding, Suswam explained that the takeover of entities (DISCOs) by banks was duly carried out in collaboration with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE).\n\nAccording to him, there is a transitional process put in place during the take-over of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) by the United Bank for Africa (UBA) to ensure efficiency in service delivery. He noted that such a process usually involved invitation of new investors to scale up generation and distribution capacities. Suswam further disclosed that the federal government had disbursed 100 million dollars to Siemens to kickstart transmission in the distribution end of the power sector.\n\nThe Edo State House of Assembly has passed a bill to repeal the Rural Electricity Board Law of 1972 to re-enact a new law that makes provision for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for the residents of Edo State, paving the way for the establishment of an electricity market in the state. The Assembly unanimously adopted all six parts of the bill during a session of the committee of the whole on Tuesday, July 19, 2022. The Speaker, Rt. Hon. Marcus Onobun, directed the Assembly Clerk to forward clean copies of the bill for assent to Governor Godwin Obaseki.\n\nThe passed bill provides for the liberalization of the electricity market in the state, allowing for a more pragmatic approach to rural electrification and expansion of distribution infrastructure in the state. The passing of the bill spells better days for electricity consumers in the state, who will now benefit from proper regulation of the electricity sector in the state, which would allow operators a more predictable business environment.\n\nIn the new regime, electricity providers in the state with Generation License, Independent Electricity Distribution Network License and Eligible Customer (willing buyer-willing seller) approval from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) would reap the full benefit of a liberalized electricity market.\n\nThe new regime will usher in by the new bill will create room for expansion of the off-grid operations of operators such as Ossiomo Power Company which enjoys a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the government. \u201cA lot is going to change. We will have a lot more certainty in the market as there is a state-level regulation for power operations. With this, the likes of Ossiomo Power Company which is already powering public utilities and industrial clusters would be assured of better regulation and would have the confidence to expand. We expect to see more players in the industry.\u201d\n\nThere is need for President Buhari to adopt Governor Obaseki\u2019s power model of power distribution in Edo State. There is competition between Ossiomo and BEDC in Edo State. There is alternative electricity in Edo State today. Nigeria needs this model to solve the electricity challenge.\n\nThe electricity market in Edo State is taking a turn for the better as increased competition among players has created options for reliable power supply to residents, who credit the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, for opening up the state for investment that has now improved their living standards.\n\nChecks in the Benin metropolis have revealed that the two major power distribution companies in the state, Benin Electricity Power Distribution Company (BEDC) and Ossiomo Power Company are in a fierce battle for the customers with the competition assuring better power options to residents.\n\nIt was discovered that with the improvement of distribution infrastructure by Ossiomo Power in select areas in the Benin metropolis, residents are opting for the company\u2019s power solution with the supply averaging 22-24hrs/day. \u201cThe industrial areas are even better served because they need electricity to keep the machines running, which is not what you get everywhere in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is great that BEDC, which used to dominate the market, now has a competitor. With this, we have a more stable market situation as people are now provided with options when considering power solutions in their homes or industries. Those who will benefit the most are industries, hotels, and others in the hospitality sector.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki had disclosed that Edo State has developed plans to help overcome the challenges of power distribution to industries, residential buildings and other users. BEDC has misunderstood this and trying to frustrate the effort of the governor in providing electricity to the people of Edo State. This includes building areas of use, that is, developing industrial parks, housing estates and other clusters that can be directly connected to generating plants.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen these plans are fully achieved, the state would have steady power supply to support businesses and other users. With time, Benin City and other towns in the state will be better planned and segregated so that industrial use of power can be separated from domestic use.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen this is done, the structural challenges along the chain of generation and distribution will then be reorganised and steady power supply will then be guaranteed,\u201d he said. He explained that steady power supply cannot be achieved overnight until the structural impediments are addressed, noting, \u201cEven if the issue of generation of power is addressed, efforts must be made to address issues mitigating distribution and transmission.\u201d\n\nObaseki is setting new boundaries for power generation in Edo State which Benin Electricity DisCo (\u201cBEDC\u201d or \u201cBenin Disco\u201d) which is one of the successor distribution companies (DisCos) created following the unbundling and privatization of the state-owned Power Utility, Power Holding Company of Nigeria Plc highly misunderstood. BEDC misunderstood Obaseki who has introduced systems approach to quantifying the value of power generation and energy storage technologies in future electricity networks. A new approach that required to determine a technology\u2019s value to the power systems of the 21st century. The centrepiece of the system value (SV) concept is a whole electricity systems model on a national scale, which simultaneously determines the ideal power system design and unit-wise operational strategy.\n\nObaseki had accused the BEDC of writing petitions against the deal sealed for the purchase of five megawatts of electricity to light up government offices in Benin City. The governor, who said the petitions have hindered the success of the purchase agreement, decried the poor supply of electricity to the state, the company\u2019s resolve not to supply pre-paid meters to electricity consumers and its culture of over-billing its clients.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201c195 communities have never seen electricity as BEDC is not ready to extend electricity to these communities. 128 communities have issues of collapse of infrastructure which BEDC is not prepared to fix. 219 transformers purchased by the state government and the former Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) as replacements for faulty transformers are yet to be installed by BEDC.\n\n\u201cThe people are over-billed with the estimated billing system of BEDC. We lost a student due to the negligence of BEDC, for refusing to fix a pole that was knocked down after receiving money to fix it. I have instructed the Attorney General of Edo State to file charges of criminal negligence against the senior management of BEDC,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nThe electricity sector in Edo State is undergoing an unprecedented transition which BEDC has failed to utilize. Today, Ossiomo power is providing affordable, secure and reliable electricity by attracting investors with low risk, stable returns. BEDC has not taken advantage of the liberal investment incentives here and improved power supply from Ossiomo. BEDC cannot provide electricity for industrial customers, for processing, producing, or assembling goods including diverse industries such as manufacturing, mining, agriculture.\n\n_____________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald, Benin City inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026 urges support for realisation of EMOWAA\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, said there is no dispute between the state government and the Palace of the Oba of Benin, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, over the return of looted Benin artefacts.\n\nObaseki made the clarification while addressing participants at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement and unveiling of phase one of the Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor noted, \u201cWhat is our plan for culture? As a people, we have a lot of assets from our past and it\u2019s our responsibility to recreate them. So, it is beyond just several pieces of artwork; no, it\u2019s beyond that. It is about using that as the contact point to bring out the best of who we are.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole lot of research that still needs to be done. We can\u2019t have things about us being explained to us from Europe. Nobody is going to do it for us.\n\n\u201cThat is why we must insist that when these works come, we host them here in Edo State, their home, so that it\u2019s available for everybody to see. There is no quarrel with the palace.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about us but the people of the state. So, let\u2019s facilitate it so everybody can access and benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t see why we cannot achieve this. So, each and every one of you here, from your Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), have the responsibility to make sure we get the first phase of the EMOWAA done and then let those coming after us build on what we have started.\u201d\n\nOn repositioning the culture sector to become a source of revenue for the state, Obaseki stated, \u201cIf we have a million people coming into the state or into Benin City for culture and tourism every year, and each one spends $1000, can you imagine the amount of money that will come into the state? Not from crude oil or the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), but from culture and tourism.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s another way to look at our development trajectory and please, I am encouraging all to provide whatever support you can to the team. Let\u2019s do it because we must start this work this year and by the time we are leaving office, we should have the first phase completed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the impact of the looted artefacts on the state, the governor said that the invasion of 1897 shocked its system and it\u2019s taking the state almost 100 years to recover.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe invasion of 1897 shocked our system and it\u2019s taking us almost 100 years to recover from that shock. Just imagine a civilization that was intact for more than seven centuries and suddenly it got shocked and the people have been in transition for better parts of the century.\n\n\u201cThat is what we found when we came into the government. So, as a democratically elected government, we owe our people and posterity that responsibility, to first explain who we are and what we have to the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cIf the Egyptians are using what they have to represent the arts of Northern Africa, then we should, as a people, have something to represent the arts of West Africa. It is important to help you understand why we are doing what we are doing and why this project is very significant.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of EMOWAA Trust, Mr. Phillip Ihenacho, said that the core mandate of EMOWAA is to support the preservation of West African heritage and culture.\n\nIhenacho further said that the project will help to empower contemporary creatives by providing infrastructure, research, education and career-building experiences for professionals in the cultural and creative space.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Credibility Group, an advocacy organisation, has frowned at the Nigeria National Petroleum (NNPC) Limited over its fuel price list for the South East geopolitical zone, which it said is unjustifiable high.\n\nThe NNPC had recently released a price list for petroleum products in different geopolitical zones of the country, with South East being one of the zones to pay more for the products.\n\nReacting to the development in a statement on Wednesday by Chief Goddy Uwazurike, its president, the Credibility Group argued that equating the South East with the core northern states flies on the face logic, given the zone\u2019s proximity to the South South, and the fact that it\u2019s also an oil producing area.\n\n\u201cThe Credibility Group unreservedly condemns the NNPC Ltd fuel price list for the South East that was released yesterday. The price list equated the cost of fuel to the users in the South East with the North West parts of Nigeria,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIt is a well known fact that the fuel consumed in the South East and South South is transported from Port Harcourt and Warri Deports. But while a buyer in the South South pays N179 per litre, such person will pay N184 the moment he crosses the Niger or Imo River Bridges.\n\n\u201cWhat is mind-boggling is that the two zones are intertwined, so much so that the Port Harcourt-Owerri Road really has no demarcation.\u201d\n\nUwazurike wondered how anyone could rationalize the idea of fuel being cheaper in the North Central than the Southeast.\n\n\u201cNow it gets very weird, if not a voodoo economics that fuel is cheaper in the North Central zone than in the oil producing South East,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCredibility demands the reversal of this joindiced economic strangulation mind will equate the cost of delivery of fuel to the South East.\u201d",

          "text": "The AnyiChucks grassroots organisation, the support group of Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii, governorship candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State, has advised Senator Obinna Ogba against parading himself as the candidate of the party, thereby misleading the public.\n\nAddressing a press conference on Thursday, Abia Onyike, director of media and publicity of the AnyiChucks grassroots mobilization, noted that the advice became necessary in the wake of recent court judgements, which Ogba and his followers were misinterpreting.\n\nOnyike said it was necessary to make it abundantly clear that Dr. Odii, and not Senator Ogba, remains the PDP candidate, a position he said, is also supported by the pronouncement of the court.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is to clear the air on the two important Court Judgements made on Tuesday, the 19th of July, 2022, namely: the Court of Appeal, Abuja and the Federal High Court, Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cFollowing these two Judgements, it has become more imperative that we inform the general public and our teeming supporters about the true situation of things regarding the two Court Judgements. It is equally important we make it abundantly clear that Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi remains the authentic Gubernatorial candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party ( PDP) in Ebonyi State. This is contrary to the fake news being spread by mischief makers and hired foot-soldiers of falsehood and deceit.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, let me draw your attention to the summary of the judgement of the Court of Appeal in Abuja delivered on 19th July, 2022. The Appeal Court remitted the appeal filed by Sen. Obinna Ogba to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to re-assign the matter to another Judge of the Federal High Court for re-trial.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki, passed another judgement on a related issue. The FHC nullified the Governorship, Senate, House of Reps and House of Assembly Primaries held on the 4th and 5th of June, 2022 which purportedly produced Sen. Ogba and others as PDP candidates for the 2023 general elections in Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cThe Court declared the exercise as unconstitutional, illegal, null and void. The Court held that Sen. Ogba and other PDP aspirants in his line up made use of fake delegates during the primaries as 90% of the authentic delegates had boycotted the primaries held on the 4th and 5th June, 2022.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it was equally held that the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) did not monitor the primaries as required by the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Court upheld the authentic PDP primaries conducted on 28th and 29th of May, 2022 which produced Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi and other candidates elected during the primaries.\n\n\u201cWith this development, it means that Sen. Ogba and his fellow travelers have no genuine reason to jubilate as they reportedly did on Tuesday, 19th July, 2022. We have gone beyond the stage of mundane/empty propaganda and orchestrated falsehood tailored to deceive the people on the streets.\n\n\u201cBy this new judgement of the FHC delivered on 19th July, 2022, nullifying the primaries conducted on 4th and 5th June, 2022, on the grounds of impersonation, Sen. Ogba has no locus whatsoever to parade himself as a candidate of the PDP in Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cLogically therefore, Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi having been validly elected as the PDP Governorship Candidate during the lawfully conducted primaries of 28th and 29th May, 2022, remains the only legally recognised torchbearer of the PDP in Ebonyi state. And his name remains in the INEC portal even as we speak.\n\n\u201cThe public should be reminded that anybody who parades himself as the PDP Guber candidate in Ebonyi state or any other candidate for that matter would be seen and perceived as an impostor, meddlesome interloper and a political miscreant and may be liable for criminal contempt of court.\u201d",

This will be done in the national interest.\n\n\u201cWe are Nigerians because Nigeria as a country exists and any issue that will translate into a threat to national security or the corporate existence of the country requires certain sacrifices.\n\n\u201cSo, regardless of the means that is being considered for the possible banning, this is a sacrifice that we see as what will help address the security challenges and I think no sacrifice is too big as far as that issue is concerned.\n\n\u201cAbove all, if you are talking of banning motorcycles, for example, I think the number of people using these motorcycles is not up to 20 percent of the Nigerian population.\n\n\u201cSo if that percentage is called to make a sacrifice that is all-pervading or affecting over 200 million Nigerians, I think that sacrifice is not too much and is worthy of being considered.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, said significant efforts were made to gather intelligence before the attack on Kuje prison in the federal capital territory (FCT) but expressed regret that there was a lack of will to act on it.\n\nAregbesola said a preliminary report of the investigation of the attack has been submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said officers who failed in their responsibilities would be punished.",

          "text": "The federal government has proposed the sum of N6.72 trillion to settle subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), otherwise known as petrol, for the year 2023.\n\nThis is contained in figures on performance of the 2022 budget between January and April 2022 released yesterday.\n\nThe figures that were released by the minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed, showed that the government recorded N3.09 trillion budget deficit within the same four months alone.\n\nThe budget performance figures showed that the actual spending as of April 31 was N4.72 trillion.\n\nOf that amount, N1.94 trillion was for debt service, and N1.26 trillion for personnel cost, including pensions. As at April, N773.63 billion had been spent on capital expenditure.\n\nOn the flip side, as of April 2022, federal government\u2019s retained revenue was only N1.63 trillion, 49 per cent of the prorata target of N3.32 trillion.\n\nBy that, the difference between actual revenue and actual expenditure is N3.09trillion, a deficit the government has had to finance with borrowing.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s share of oil revenues was N285.38 billion, representing 39 per cent performance, while non-oil tax revenues totalled N632.56 billion, a performance of 84 per cent.\n\nCompany income tax and Value Added Tax (VAT) collections were N298.83 billion and N102.97 billion, representing 99 per cent and 98 per cent of their respective targets.\n\nCustoms collections, made up of import duties, excise and fees, as well as federation account special levies, trailed target by N76.77 billion (25.42 per cent).\n\nOther revenues amounted to N664.64 billion, of which independent revenue was N394.09 billion.\n\nPresenting the medium-term outlook for 2023-2025 period, the government\u2019s real GDP growth is projected at 3.75 per cent in 2023, from a revised projection of 3.55 per cent for 2022.\n\nGrowth is expected to moderate to 3.30 per cent in 2024 before picking up to 3.46 per cent in 2025.\n\nThe inflation rate is projected to average 17.16 per cent in 2023, up from the revised average of 16.11 per cent for 2022.\n\nUpward pressure on prices is expected to be driven by the current and lag effect of the global price surge due to the Russian-Ukraine war, domestic insecurity, rising costs of imports, exchange rate depreciation, as well as other supply-side constraints.\n\nThe federal government projected fiscal outcomes in the medium-term framework under two scenarios based on the underlying budget parameters/assumptions.\n\nUnder scenario 1, which is described as the business-as-usual scenario, the forecast is that if the subsidy on PMS remains, it will cost the federal government N6.72 trillion for full year 2023 to settle subsidy claims.\n\nOn the other hand, the expectation is that if petrol subsidy will remain up to mid-2023 based on the 18-month extension announced for full implementation of Petroleum Industry Act by President Muhammadu Buhari early 2021, only N3.36 trillion will be needed as subsidy payment.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, there will be tighter enforcement of the performance management framework for GOEs that will significantly increase operating surplus/dividend remittances in 2023,\u201d the minister of finance said yesterday at an event that was held in Abuja.\n\nReps To Probe 2017-2021 Fuel Subsidy Regime\n\nIronically, in 2023 federal government revenue is projected at N6.34 trillion, out of which only N373.17 billion or 5.9 per cent is expected to come from oil-related sources. The balance of N5.97 trillion is to be earned from non-oil sources.\n\nHowever, if the subsidy regime is ended at the middle of next year, the projection is to have an aggressive implementation of cost-to-income limits of government owned enterprises (GOEs).\n\nWith these, the 2023 revenue is projected at N8.46 trillion (15.1 per cent or N1.51 trillion less than the 2022 Budget) but N2.12 trillion more than scenario 1.\n\nOut of that, N1.99 trillion or 23.6 per cent is projected to come from oil-related sources, while the balance is to be earned from non-oil sources.",

To close this gap, the Central Bank of Nigeria has introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on boosting poultry production, creating decent jobs, and fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector. One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualised specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cToday we witness the commissioning of the first project to be funded and completed through the Scheme. Certainly, the laudable objectives of the Scheme including improving the revenue of tertiary institutions, employment creation and enhancing research into poultry by tertiary institutions are already being realised\u201d\n\nThe CBN Boss, however, tasked other similar institutions across the country to follow the University of Ilorin example.\n\nIn his speech, the Vice-chancellor of the University of Ilorin, professor Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, spoke on how the journey to the realization of the project began and extol the significance of the project in the history of the University.\n\n\u201cThe journey has been long and hard for us as a University. The university took a 600 million naira loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, at a concessionary interest rate of 9% (5% for the first year) and a repayment period of 6 years, with a moratorium on the repayment of the principal for one year. Zenith Bank plc is the participating financial institution on the project.\n\n\u201cAccessing the loan required the University to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project. The SPV is Unilorin Bizface synergy Limited, a limited liability company registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission.\n\n\u201cTo guarantee the loan, the University worked out an irrevocable standing payment (ISPO) with Zenith Bank plc, ensuring Zenith Bank was paid quarterly the amount due, according to the amortization\u201d, he said.\n\nThe project which is placed on 30 hectares started in February in the year 2022 and was commissioned on 21st July.\n\nThe VC, noted that \u201cthe farm has 6 fully built Broilers\u2019 pens with a capacity, of 5,000 birds each and another two of similar capacity, under construction to raise the total installed capacity to 40,000 Broilers, four fully built layers pens currently housing 17,000 layers, though with an installed capacity of 33,000, a Feed mill with an installed capacity of 5tons/hours, a semi-automated Broiler processing unit (BPU) with a capacity to process 1,000 birds/day and a manure processing unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn job creation, at the height of construction, the site had over 200 artisans earning their daily sustenance from it. Today the farm has 55 full time employees and has created space for students of the hosting institution to work on part time basis\u201d, he further stated.\n\nHe dded that the University is also developing 2,000 hectares of land for Maize and Soya beans cultivation for the exclusive use of the poultry farm\n\nThe vice-chancellor however lauded the project and thanked the steering committee led by the deputy vice-chancellor, research, technology and innovation Professor Mikhail Olayinka Buhari for the efforts put in place to make the project reality and subsequent overseeing of the project.",

I know that you are going to ask us what is happening to the Bayelsa International Airport.\n\n\u201cThere are a few issues, but they are not really our issues as a government per se. We are aware some persons are pushing the news that the airport has been downgraded. That is not true. The Bayelsa Airport has not been downgraded.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is that the two airlines working with us have gone for D-Check. The D-Check means a plane going for a major maintenance check after it had been put to flight operations for 10 years to determine its airworthiness.\n\n\u201cIf you watch very well, even flights in their regular or primary routes, like the Port Harcourt to Abuja route, have now been reduced to only one daily flight.\u201d\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, who noted that government was doing its best to change the general impression of leadership in the state, said the administration had taken proactive steps to checkmate the impact of the forecast impending large flood.\n\nHe called on the Federated Correspondents Chapel to help push out the good things government was doing in Bayelsa, noting that the Prosperity Administration was not resting on its oars in all sectors ranging from agriculture, sports, health to security.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, thanked the media for their support to the present administration right from its inception to date and assured the Chapel that government would support their annual lecture slated for November this year.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, however, observed that the standard of journalistic practice was in a steady decline in Nigeria, and therefore, called on the Correspondents Chapel and its parent body, the Nigeria Union of Journalists, to raise the bar.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the state Chairman of the Federated Correspondents Chapel, NUJ, Mr. Tife Owolabi, said the visit was meant to formally introduce the newly elected executive members of the Chapel to the Deputy Governor.\n\nMr. Owolabi, who poured encomiums on the Deputy Governor for being media friendly, prayed the state\u2019s government to carry the correspondents chapel along in its programmes and events, even as he appealed for support towards their annual lecture programme.",

          "text": "By Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Niger Delta Development Commission, (NDDC) has launched a novel Niger Delta Talent Hunt (NIDETH) to harness creativity among youths in the entertainment industry and address unemployment in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe Interim Administrator, NDDC, Dr. Efiong Akwa, who spoke on Wednesday during the inauguration of the programme at the NDDC headquarters in Port Harcourt said it was designed to tackle the challenges and lack of opportunities facing youths in the region.\n\nDr. Akwa commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Mr. Umana Okon Umana, for supporting activities aimed at harnessing the creative potential of youths in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe entertainment industry is growing bigger everyday. The Nollywood industry occupies a major platform amongst other entertainment industries in the world. When you talk of entertainment the next thing you hear is Nollywood industry in Nigeria. Niger Delta is blessed.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to tell the world that youths of the Niger Delta are the best you can find around the world. They are calm, confident, they seek to excel in whatever endeavour they find themselves.\n\n\u201cIn the field of soccer the youths of Rivers State and Akwa-Ibom are taking the lead; wrestling, Delta and Edo are tops; swimming Bayelsa and Rivers are unbeatable.\n\n\u201cOur focus in this programme is to identify the talented youths, build them up and expose them to the world. We want to use this as an opportunity to provide a platform to expose the hidden talents in the region. If you build the youth, you build the nation.\u201d\n\nDr. Akwa\u2019s Special Adviser on Youths, Engr. Udengs Eradiri, described the Niger Delta youths as enterprising, observing that artistes from the region had challenges of getting support and platforms to express themselves.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe creative industry is one area that we can engage a lot of idle young people. We will continue to play our role in supporting institutions to create the platform to push our young people to the international community. We must keep the creative sector alive in the Niger Delta to develop young talents and to showcase them to the world.\n\n\u201cWe expect that after this process, we will be able to identify unique talents that would be able to showcased to the world. If you look at the entertainment industry you have employment opportunities that are waiting for us.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta youths need to be a part of these opportunities. We need to create engagements so that young people, who have a lot of energy can channel it towards talent development. The work of the NDDC is that of an interventionist agency. It is part of our job to create opportunities for young people to express themselves.\n\n\u201cThe sky is our starting point. We expect that after this talent hunt which is geared towards entertainment, we will be looking at sports\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the NDDC Director, Youths and Sports, Mr. Offiong Ephraim, said that NIDETH was a flagship programme of the NDDC Youths and Sports Directorate aimed at exposing the inherent talents in the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe said the talent hunt programme would kick off from the first phase which is Ondo, Edo and Delta State and followed by the other phases with the grand finale taking place in Port Harcourt, Rivers State noting that it would cover the nine states of the Niger Delta Region.\n\nOne of the leading artistes in the region and consultant for the programme, Mr. Okiri Harrison, also known as Harry Song, said that the new NDDC youth programme was a dream come true for those in the creative sector.\n\nHe said that 80 per cent of the entertainment industry was rooted in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe musician said: \u201cIn the entertainment industry, cutting across music, comedy and theatre, the top talents are from the Niger Delta region. The main issue is that most talents remain unharnessed because there is no proper platform to identify and develop them. I am glad because this is where NIDETH comes in\u201d.",

Obi picked Yusuf Baba-Ahmed as his running mate, while Tinubu went for Kashim Shettima.\n\nResponding to the originating motion, via a notice of preliminary objection, dated July 18, Obi\u2019s counsel, Mr Alex Ejesieme (SAN), is seeking an order of the court striking out or dismissing PDP\u2019s suit \u201cfor want of requisite jurisdiction\u201d.

          "title": "Nigeria: New Senate Bill Allows States to Generate, Distribute Electricity",
          "text": "The Nigeria Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow states to generate and distribute electricity.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage was sequel to the consideration of a report by the Committee on Power.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Senator Gabriel Suswam (PDP, Benue North East), in his presentation, said the bill seeks to, amongst others, provide an Ideal legal and institutional framework to leverage on the modest gains of the privatisation phase of the electricity power sector in Nigeria.\n\nHe also said anyone or firm generating electricity below one megawatts do not need licence to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bill, when signed into law, will open up the space in the power industry and allows states or individuals with capacities to generate their own power and distribute.\n\n\u201cSince electricity is on the Concurrent List in the constitution, the bill has allowed state governments to license people who intend to operate mini grid within the state.\n\n\u201cThe bill also gives legal backing to renewable energy. If you decide to generate one megawatt of power using solar as energy source, that is also provided for.\n\n\u201cThat is the only way the power problem would be solved. The space is now opened. There is little restriction as to who will generate power and distribute.\n\n\u201cWhat is obtainable now is that any power generated must be put on the national grid for transmission and distribution.\n\n\u201cThe bill also provides that any power generated below one megawatt does not require license to distribute.\u201d\n\nHe added that when signed into law, the bill would improve utilisation of generated power through increased investments in new technologies to enhance transmission and distribution of generated power to minimise aggregate value chain loses.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the piece of legislation would, \u201creinvigorate the Institutional framework for the reform of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) initiated and implemented by the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the provisions of the bill seek to promote policies and regulatory measures that would ensure the expansion of power transmission networks in Nigeria in order to address any imbalance in the existing transmission infrastructure.\n\nSuswam noted that the bill would stimulate policy and regulatory measures to scale up efficient power generation, transmission and distribution capabilities of the sector; as well as address technological limitations and outdated infrastructure that are responsible for value chain loses.\n\nThe Senate President midway through consideration of the bill sought to know the role and operational capacity of banks that had taken over distribution companies (discos) indebted to them.\n\nResponding, Suswam explained that the take-over of entities (Discos) by banks was duly carried out in collaboration with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE).\n\nAccording to him, there was a transitional process put in place during the take-over of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) by the United Bank for Africa (UBA) to ensure efficiency in service delivery.\n\nHe noted that such transitional process usually involves the invitation of new investors to scale up generation and distribution capacities.\n\nHe further disclosed that the federal government had disbursed $100 million to Siemens to kick-start transmission in the distribution end of the power sector.\n\nOn his part, Senator Ahmad Babba-Kaita (PDP \u2013 Katsina North), said the faulty way in which Discos were created was largely responsible for their inability to live up to expectations.\n\nHe, therefore advised the federal government to ensure a transparent process in the selection of companies to take-over power generation and distribution across the country.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the passage of the bill, said, \u201cbecause of its importance and sensitivity, we would like to see a quick concurrence by the House of Representatives, because time is of essence as far as Nigeria is concerned when you talk about electricity and energy supplies in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, we would like to see that this bill is fully processed in the National Assembly and sent to the Executive side of government for the consideration for assent by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this piece of legislation can change the fortunes of the electricity industry in Nigeria for the better.\u201d\n\nSenate passes Nigeria Start-up Bill\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has passed the Nigerian Start-up Bill, 2022. The passage of the bill followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on ICT and Cyber Security.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Senator Oseni Yakubu (APC \u2013 Kogi Central), in his presentation, said the bill seeks to provide for the establishment of the National Council for Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship.\n\nAccording to him, the council, upon its establishment, would create and develop an enabling environment for technology-enabled start-ups in Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, a bill for an Act to provide for the ease of doing business to ensure transparency, efficiency and productivity in Nigeria and for other related matters, on Wednesday, scaled second reading.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by the Deputy Senate Leader, Ajayi Boroffice (APC \u2013 Ondo North).\n\nThe bill after consideration, was referred by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, to the Committee on Trade and Investment for further legislative inputs.\n\nThe Committee was given two weeks to report back to the chamber in plenary.\n\nIn a related development, another bill to establish the Federal Nephrology and Kidney Research and Treatment Centre Hadejia, also scaled second reading on the floor.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Senator Hassan Ibrahim Hadejia (APC \u2013 Jigawa North-East), was referred by Lawan to the Committee on Health (Secondary and Tertiary).\n\nThe Senator Yahaya Oloriegbe-led Committee was given four weeks to turn in its report.\n\nSunday Aborisade in Abuja",

          "title": "NNPC Chief Kyari Targets Fortune 500 Top 50 in Three Years",
          "text": "The Group Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari on Wednesday disclosed that \u2013 working with the Board, management and staff of the company \u2013 his target is to make the entity be among the top 50 among the Fortune 500 Companies in three years.\n\nThe NNPC Limited on Tuesday officially transitioned into a private entity that is now regulated in line with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the GCEO explained that with the huge assets available to the company and the new corporate culture of profit orientation, NNPCL would soon become the toast of the entire continent.\n\nFortune 500 refers to a list of 500 of the largest companies compiled by Fortune magazine, United States, every year wherein companies are ranked by their annual revenues for their respective fiscal years.\n\nThe list includes both public and private companies using publicly available revenue data. According to him, the target would be achievable in the near term.\n\nWhile admitting that because of the mode of operation of the company in the past, Nigerians had lost faith in it, Kyari stated that henceforth the company has no room for excuses not to deliver on its mandate as a commercial venture.\n\n\u201cWe have to deliver together and we are ready to deliver. We know our shareholders, the 200 million Nigerians are doubtful, but we need to surprise them because we know that there is a new expectation and this expectation can be met and this will be led by culture change.\n\n\u201cBefore, you could lose money and nothing will happen, government could always pay, but the law now says we have no recourse to public funds, it will be a commercial relationship\u2026and we have no room for excuses,\u201d he assured.\n\nKyari pointed out that the net assets of the new company remain a major factor working in its favour, stressing that its upstream assets alone could be worth between $80-$90 billion.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this is that the NNPC will clearly not be below 150 (currently) in the Fortune 500 companies and I can tell you this upfront: Our target is that by sheer act of doing things right, we are getting into a business, delivering value and investing appropriately and within three to four years\u2019 time, we should be counting ourselves among the first 50 in the Fortune 500 companies,\u201d he boasted.\n\nHe disputed insinuations that the NNPC was presently in a, \u2018deep financial hole,\u2019 insisting that no company declares profit when its finances are in trouble like the NNPC did last year.\n\nHe added that although Nigerians were losing faith in the NNPC as a corporation, the company would shock doubters by its new mode of adopting global best practices in its operation.\n\n\u201cThings have changed and that change is now being amplified because we have an enabling legislation and we are bound by a new set of rules under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA),\u201d he noted.\n\nStating that the oil and gas industry remains a very profitable one and that the company was willing to scale up its value, he lamented that oil firms less than half of NNPCL\u2019s assets were making more profit.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be IPO ready by the middle of next year,\u201d he reiterated, insisting that the company\u2019s processes will henceforth be world class, reducing wastes as well as paying more taxes to the government.\n\nAlready the largest company in Africa, Kyari noted that Nigerians will be proud of the new NNPC in years to come, with a clear deviation from the way it operated in the past.\n\nIn the coming years, he stated that the company would have private equity, explaining that this would mature in the next 11 months, culminating in a mixed ownership of its shares.\n\n\u201cWe are not in the rank of companies which will be talking about N287 billion (its profit in 2020). We felt very little doing that last year, but we also know we are coming from a past. It\u2019s a process and it will be scaled up,\u201d he added.\n\nOn subsidy, he reiterated that it would no longer be a burden to the NNPC like it was in the last, explaining that it would not affect the company\u2019s bottom line as the oil firm would henceforth charge a fee for providing such service to the government.\n\nHe noted that the ministry of petroleum incorporated and the ministry of finance incorporated currently hold the shares of the company on behalf of over 200 million Nigerians.\n\nOn the contention that the states and local governments are not currently represented on the board of the NNPCL since it\u2019s a federation asset, Kyari stated that the National Assembly which made the law clearly represents every Nigerian.\n\nNNPC: Why Refineries May Not Operate at 100% Capacity After Rehabilitation\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC has said it may not be possible for the Port Harcourt, Warrri and Kaduna oil refineries to function at their full capacities when they come back on stream after rehabilitation.\n\nThe Group Chief Financial Officer (Group CFO) of NNPC, Umar Ajiya, who also spoke on Arise News Channel, noted however, that they would operate at about 80 to 85 per cent nameplate capacity because they constructed roughly 30 years ago.\n\nAjiya disclosed that work on the Warri refinery would likely start next week, noting that the newly adopted model would ensure that the right thing was done so that lenders on the project can be paid back as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to Ajiya, the NNPC decided to repair the assets because it would endanger its objective of ensuring energy security for the nation without some level of operation in the downstream.\n\n\u201cAs envisaged in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), we have to ensure energy security for the country. To that extent, we cannot run away from the refineries. We have to rehabilitate them.\n\n\u201cBut what is changing is that the refineries are going to be rehabilitated with a combination of our own equity and lenders\u2019 money and no lender will lend you money unless they know the money will come out after the rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cBut on top of that, the lenders have also insisted that there has to be O&M contractors supervising the operation of the refineries day in day out. So, rehabilitation is ongoing. Port Harcourt is ongoing, Warri is about to commence any moment, probably next week,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nThe CFO argued that if the nation were to build new refineries, they would cost too much, maintaining that the rehabilitation undertaken by the NNPC remains the best in the circumstance.\n\n\u201cSo, we have that intention to make sure these refineries come back. New refineries are very expensive. You are talking about $3 billion to $5 billion, but the rehabilitation is costing $1 billion and Warri is less than $500 million.\n\n\u201cThese refineries will be rehabilitated but they cannot operate at 100 per cent nameplate capacity. They were constructed almost 30 years ago, so you will expect that when they are fully rehabilitated, they will deliver between 80 per cent to 85 per cent capacity.\n\n\u201cHowever, these same refineries that are being rehabilitated are going to deliver value to not only the shareholders but to lenders who have put money on the table. So, we don\u2019t see any issue because irrespective of whether you rehabilitate or not, you have to do the regular maintenance needed for any plant, whether annual or biannual,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said some other commercialised government businesses failed in the last because in those circumstances, the code of corporate governance was not institutionalised, adding that even after privatisation, government still controlled majority holding.\n\nFor him, in the short to mid-term, the NNPCL will require private funding so that all control mechanisms will be fully activated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why in the PIA, the law envisages that we should go public. When you bring private equity participants, they will ensure that the code of conduct works and that if the board is not performing, its easy to fire them and if management is not doing its work, it will be fired by the board,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has welcomed with high expectation the transition of the NNPC to an independent limited liability company.\n\nNEITI, in a statement released in Abuja, said that the transition was in line with the recommendations of NEITI industry reports for the oil and gas sector covering 1999 to 2019 which equally led to the emergence of the PIA 2021.\n\n\u201cIn the NEITI oil and gas reports that covered 1999 \u2013 2019, NEITI has consistently recommended that Nigeria\u2019s national oil company should be privatised to make it competitive like other national oil companies across the globe,\u201d it stated.\n\nNEITI\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji expressed hope that with the transition to a commercial entity, the NNPC is now in a better position to compete favourably with leading international oil companies around the world.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a business oriented NNPC to deliver the country\u2019s energy needs, energy transition, energy security, diversification of its economy and the building of a sustainable energy future for the country\u201d, Orji noted.\n\nHe further explained that the immediate challenges that the new NNPC needs to tackle is to free Nigeria from fuel importation.\n\n\u201cThe immediate questions that an average Nigerian is asking are: What is likely to change from the NNPC we know and the new NNPC Limited? What will happen to jobs, institutions, profit making, transparency and accountability?\u201d Orji stressed.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has discribed Bishops, who attended the official unveiling of the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Kashim Shettima as selfish desperados.\n\nVice-President of CAN (19 Northern States and Abuja) and its chairman in Kaduna State, Rev. Joseph John Hayab, said this in an interview with journalists in Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe people we saw at the unveiling of Shettima paraded as Bishops are people who did not have enough time to learn how to wear Bishop garments. Take a closer look at their photo and you will see another Nollywood movie.\n\n\u201cCAN wonders why the desperation. First, a story was out claiming to have come from the Chairman of CAN Borno State only to be refuted. Secondly, there was another lie that BAT (Bola Ahmed Tinubu) and his running mate were on their way to meet CAN President one night. A meeting that was not true and was on a night that the CAN President was in Alabama, USA attending the Baptist World Alliance Conference of which he is the Vice President.\n\n\u201cAnother desperation story was that they met Papa Adeboye, which the RCCG later refuted. If Christians are not important why the desperation?\n\n\u201cBAT is free to hire mechanics and other artisans and sew clerical garments for them. An effort that will only add to their many ropes, when the political exercise is over but will not change the need for fairness and justice that CAN is calling for,\u201d he said.",
