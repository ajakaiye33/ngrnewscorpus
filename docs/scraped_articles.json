          "text": "A leading member of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, has stated that Nigerians are dying every day due to insecurity.\n\nHe said that in all this, nothing tangible has been done by the President and Commander in Chief, President Muhammadu Buhari to visibly curtail the situation.\n\nBamgbose pointed out that the spate of insecurity in Nigeria is alarming and fast becoming a hopeless matter, adding that there are heavy doubts in the minds of Nigerians regarding Buhari\u2019s ability to end the reign of insecurity in the nation.\n\n\u201cIt has become obvious that Buhari lacks what it takes to secure Nigeria. The responses so far from the Presidency have shown that the insecurity in Nigeria has become hopeless and helpless,\u201d Bamgbose, a senior lawyer, told DAILY POST.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency has formed the habit of giving Nigerians false hope and fake assurances, but very unfortunately the insecurity is getting worse day by day.\n\n\u201cThe headlines in a matter of weeks are quite alarming and very unfortunate. Let\u2019s examine a few of them, In Niger State, gunmen kill 37 civilians, four die as gunmen attack oil workers in Imo, bandits kill four, abduct scores in Katsina, gunmen invade Abuja community, kidnap chief, one other, injure two, 22 killed, 14 injured in Jos, bandits attack Zamfara college, kill security officers, abduct score of students. Nigeria has never had it so bad.\n\n\u201cThese stories come daily. President Buhari as usual, will condemn the attacks, assure Nigerians that he will deal with the insecurity, and finally meet with the security chiefs.\n\n\u201cThese have been the system. Nigerians are dying every day due to insecurity and nothing tangible has been done to visibly curtail insecurity.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, in a civilized society, Buhari ought to have resigned honourably and vacated\n\nthe Presidential Villa as a result of his inability to stop the menace of insecurity, but that is certainly not an option that will be considered in our polity.\n\n\u201cThe one-million-naira question is, how long are we to wait for President Buhari to crush the insurgents? President Buhari has less than two years to move out of Aso Rock and there is no hope at sight to give Nigerians a glimpse of hope that things will be better.\n\n\u201cThe country is gasping for breath. Let\u2019s tell ourselves the truth APC government has completely messed up the polity. Very unfortunately they have strong plans to cling to power come 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria may not be able to survive another 8 years of APC government, I seriously doubt that.\n\n\u201cThere must be concerted efforts to ensure that APC is ejected from the Presidential Villa come 2023 or Nigeria may be grounded.\u201d",

We started at the Okpala junction at Ngor Okpala and moved to Ahiara junction in Ahiazu Mbaise, to Amanwaozozu in Ikeduru and lastly to the Government House junction on Okigwe road in Owerri Municipal Council.\u201d\n\nOsuagwa added: \u201cWe defied the rains to do this because we want peace in the state, without which there will not be progress. We as monarchs will always support the government in power, regardless of how the person emerged. We advise the citizens to do same because power comes from God. In all the places we visited, the people were happy to receive us, because they are tired of the daily killings.\n\n\u201cGovernor Hope Uzodimma is doing his best. He needs to be supported for the state to move forward.\u201d\n\nThe traditional ruler of Ngurunwekeoha community in Aboh Mbaise, Eze John David Nwaaturuocha Oha, said what the Owerri zonal monarchs had done was to ensure peace and progress.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat we have done today is for peace and progress of the state. We are not in support of the bloodshed being witnessed in the state. The Ezes moved out for a peace rally and as you could see, the young and the old came out to join in this movement for peace.\n\n\u201cWe have come to bless our land. We are not happy over the recent happenings because it is not in our character to be violent. We are known for peace. Our governor is a good man and the people of Mbaise are with him. We appeal to our youths to stop destruction and killings.\u201d\n\nEze Pius Onyekwere of Nnarambia in Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government said God has bestowed power on Governor Uzodimma, therefore he cannot be questioned.\n\n\u201cWe as owners of the land, we are also the voice of our people. We are calling for peace. We have decreed that peace has returned and it has indeed returned to the state. We must, as citizens of Imo State, support our governor for the progress of the state. We are for any government in power and not politicians,\u201d he said.",

Abubakar, who was chairman of the occasion, called on Nigerians to defend democracy saying fixing or restructuring Nigeria would help in nation-building, adding that such would help to foster a sense of nationhood.\n\n\u201cOne lesson for all of us is the need to always be vigilant and be prepared to defend our democracy for it is through the democratic process that we can more easily promote the unity of our country. Strongly believe that Nigeria can and will remain one strong and united nation with significant strides in economic development to improve the lives of our peoples.\u201d He said that Nigeria should be restructured in a manner that allows various segments to develop at their own pace and not be held back by the centre or other segments.\n\nHe said developed segments would spur development in other segments because what they do well would attract the attention of others therefore making Nigerian union more attractive and nation-building easier.\n\nThe former vice president said that nationhood has to be forged through what people do as a country, and that leadership was critical in the process of nation-building.\n\n\u201cLeaders give direction and the example they set determines the extent to which their followers will trust them. Without trust, there\u2019s no leadership. Without leadership, a country drifts and becomes more difficult to forge into a nation. When we start developing with what we have, more of our people will want to identify with the country, love the country and commit their lives to the country.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, especially with fairness and justice, nation-building accelerates, however imperfectly; development and nation-building do not happen by themselves. They are guided by people, especially leaders, thoughtful, insightful, and visionary leaders who are willing to make sacrifices and reach compromises,\u201d he said.\n\nAbubakar said when people see their leaders making efforts genuinely, and experience improvements in their lives, they were likely to follow suit.\n\nHe, however, said that citizens needed to work hard and make necessary compromise to accommodate one another.\n\nEkiti Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and keynote speaker at the launch said there was no nation today that was wholly satisfied with its present status, adding that every nation at all times worked to become better. \u201cFor us as a people, our focus should be about how we can reinvent our nation, work for the prosperity of our people and ensure peace and prosperity. Indeed few people will disagree with the view that there is a significant gap between our potential for greatness as a country and the reality of where we are now. It is therefore a great duty for all of us, to continue to seek every opportunity to make the dream of a great nation come to pass.\u2019\u2019\n\nFayemi urged Nigerians to uphold the message of the second stanza of national anthem which says \u201cto build a nation where peace and justice reign.\u201d\n\nDr. Chido Onumah, editor of the book, said the book was a product of 11 years of planning, adding that the original idea was conceived in 2010 to coincide with Nigeria at 50.\n\nOnumah said that the book was the product of discussion on what needed to be done to rescue Nigeria.\n\nHe added that the aim was to give an opportunity to young Nigerians to help the country understand and sharpen its focus on the issues that should hold key to its survival.",

We believe strongly that will be the only sure path upon which our God giving natural resources can be managed by us, and not this impunity we have witnessed from a repressive federal government under President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d",

          "text": "By Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu\n\nClerk to the National Assembly, Ojo Olatunde Amos, Thursday disclosed that late former President Shehu Shagari prevented members of the Second Republic National Assembly from making themselves members of the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC).\n\nAmos made this known while playing host to a delegation of the Committee on Administration and Human Resources of Ghana Parliamentary Service Board at the National Assembly.\n\nHe said when the idea was mooted by then Senate Leader, late Senator Olusola Saraki, Shagari turned it down by asking the then serving Senators and members of the House of Representatives to choose whether to be members of the commission and forfeit their legislative seats or remain as serving lawmakers.\n\nThe Clerk explained how parliamentary bureaucracy was treated like an appendage of the Executive arm of government until year 2000 when the National Assembly Service Commission was created.\n\nHe said: \u201cBetween 1979 and 1985, politicians tended to act in the military fashion rather than exhibiting democratic traits. For instance, in 1981 when the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria initiated a bill for an Act to establish the National Assembly Service Commission, the then Senate leader, Sen. Olusola Saraki, was said to have proposed that membership of the Commission be composed of Senators and members of the House of Representatives serving at the time.\n\n\u201cWhen the proposal got to President Shehu Shagari, he asked the Members of the National Assembly to choose between being members of the National Assembly and members of the National Assembly Service Commission. However the Legislative proposal for the commission\u2019s establishment did not see the light of the day during the Shagari administration, perhaps due to the sudden military takeover of power in December 1983.\n\n\u201c1983 the National Assembly was again suspended until 1993 when General Ibrahim Babangida ousted Buhari. Before then, General Ibrahim Babangida had in 1988 through decree 48 of 1988 directed the creation of departments in various ministries of government and National Assembly was created as a department in the presidency. What this implies is that until the return of democracy in 1999 and the creation of the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) in 2000, National Assembly bureaucracy was not totally independent of the Executive arm.\u201d\n\nHe assured the Ghanaian delegation led by Hon Johnson Asiedu Nketiah that processes and procedures guiding the Nigerian model of independent Parliament and its bureaucracy, will be available to them.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "title": "Meet Regina Honu, a Ghanaian software developer teaching thousands of girls to code",
          "text": "Choosing the name of her company was the easiest aspect of Regina Honu\u2019s journey.\n\nIt only took her a few hours to connect the dots. She wanted her business to be unique; the word unique in Ghanaian language Twi translated to Soronko, so she named her company Soronko Academy \u2014 the first coding and human-centred design school for children and young adults in West Africa.\n\n\u201cSome people take days to pick their company name, I tell entrepreneurs that they\u2019re majoring in the minor. I say pick what you like and keep it moving, you can build a brand on it,\u201d she said over a call.\n\nAlmost ten years after she made that decision, Soronko Academy has trained over 20,000 young people in Ghana and Burkina Faso and connected about 5,000 of them to job opportunities. She\u2019s won multiple awards from brands such as Coca Cola and CNN for her contribution to tech in Ghana and Africa. She\u2019s also a Mandela Washington Fellow and an Ashoka Fellow.\n\nBut the road to starting Soronko Academy was paved with many obstacles and difficult decisions. She has worked at two major banks in Ghana as the only woman in the IT department, participated in a reality show and even almost joined Microsoft but turned back to pursue her dream of ensuring that young ladies have access to the same opportunities that she did while growing up.\n\nPlaying PAC-man, flying with rockets and ending up in the Kitchen\n\nHonu grew up in the 90s, a time where there were only a few reputable careers that people could explore. At the age of 12, she wanted to be a doctor until her father brought home a personal computer (PC). She mostly played PAC-man on it, which sparked her interest in computer science and inspired her to want to create her own game.\n\nA few months later, she watched a movie about a man being able to fly with a rocket strapped to his back. So she decided she was going to build her own rocket. To show how determined she was to make this a reality, she sketched a rocket and showed it to her teacher who quickly downplayed her ambition.\n\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s impossible, girls don\u2019t build rockets and I\u2019ll end up in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nThat experience made her shelve her ambition to build rockets and detest the fact that people always told her what she could do based on her gender. From then on she decided to become a computer scientist \u2014 the only one in her class with such ambition.\n\nFailure is not final\n\nIn her first year in senior secondary school, Honu had her first taste of failure during an Inter-school quiz competition. She missed a question in the final causing the school to not clinch the winning spot.\n\n\u201cI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to try anything again, I\u2019m a failure in life.\u201d\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in her mouth but being one of the brightest in her school meant that when another competition came along she was selected to represent her school. This time she was determined to go all out and win.\n\nIn order to impress the judges, she went as far as learning some Latin. Fortunately, she ended up winning the competition. This win was a huge confidence booster and a reminder that failure is not final.\n\nThe best part about winning the competition was that it gave her the opportunity to spend one year in Norway on a school exchange program.\n\nA year in Norway\n\nAt the age of 16, Honu had her first exposure to a different culture. She continued as a science student but quickly found out that things were different in Norway. The focus in her new school was more on comprehension but she was used to memorizing and regurgitating information without necessarily understanding it.\n\n\u201cI found out that I didn\u2019t understand anything. I could draw a very complex electrical circuit but if you give me two wires and a bulb to connect, I\u2019ll be lost.\u201d\n\nIn Norway the mode of training was different; students had access to formula books and calculators. All they had to do was understand how to apply the formula. She was initially lost but soon found her feet as she adapted to the more practical learning style.\n\nOutside of schooling, she learnt how to ride a bicycle, rollerblade and climb mountains. She even got a taste of activism by joining a protest. The experience taught her that she could do more than she thought she could.\n\n\u201cI think that Norwegian experience has shaped the way I am. People always ask me, were you born and raised in Ghana you seem different. I came back with a different way of thinking. \u201c\n\nGetting into University\n\nWhen it was time to choose where to get her first degree, there was some dispute between whether she should school abroad or remain in Ghana. Her mother opted for the former while she wanted the latter.\n\nFor Honu, she had lived abroad and wasn\u2019t fascinated by the idea. She was also concerned about the prospects of travelling out and not returning. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the brain drain phenomenon.\n\nHonu won the dispute but was faced with one more challenge. She wanted to study computer science but wasn\u2019t impressed by the fact that courses being taught in the universities in Ghana weren\u2019t evolving quickly.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she\u2019ll have to concede to her mum until her dad spotted an advert in the newspaper for Ashesi University, a new school that was recruiting its first set of students. Asheshi promised its future students a world-class education with an up-to-date curriculum.\n\nConversation between Regina Honu and students of Ashesi University during a visit. Photo Credit: Ashesi Unversity\n\n\u201cI remember at that time, Ashesi was just a house at Labone. I walked in and saw that the university was a house but it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, she got into Ashesi to study computer science. At that time the total population of the school was 30 students, with 14 of them in the computer science program.\n\nAmerican futurist, Alvin Toffler is credited with saying that the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn. Honu definitely agrees with this quote as she spent her first year at Ashesi unlearning many of the wrong ideas she had.\n\nGoing through University wasn\u2019t without its own struggles. In her second year, she found visual basics difficult to understand and considered switching to a business major.\n\nBut on her way to the dean\u2019s office she had a rethink.\n\n\u201cI asked myself, \u2018Is this how I\u2019m going to give up?\u2019 I decided to give it one more shot. I immersed myself in work. They\u2019ll give us group assignments and I will do it myself. I carried the load on my head, I was doing all the work and it became easy for me.\u201d\n\nIn her third year, she got her first internship at a software company. At this company, the stamina she had built for solving difficult problems came in handy, as Ashesi students were expected to go above and beyond.\n\n\u201cThere were times when my boss would give me tasks and I wouldn\u2019t understand it or know what to do but how would I say \u2018excuse me, sir, they didn\u2019t teach us that in class.\u2019 So I\u2019ll take out time to understand the question first before even trying to answer it, then go on to solve it.\u201d\n\nAfter the internship, she was retained by the company while still in school. This experience was her first taste of independence as she had moved on from relying on her dad who was giving her pocket money.\n\nWelcome to the Corporate world\n\nAfter school, she returned to work for the software company briefly before joining Zenith bank.\n\nTwo things attracted her to the bank: an increase in the pay and the expectation that because the bank closed to customers by 5 pm, the workers also closed at that time. But upon joining the bank she found out that the latter was not the case.\n\nShe quickly excelled on the job and became popular after she built an intranet system for the bank. She was responsible for re-engineering the bank\u2019s IT products used in Lagos for Ghana.\n\nBeing the only female in the IT department at the bank came with its own challenges. During meetings the men on the team tried to apportion the job of taking minutes or getting refreshments to her. She grew a thick skin to ward off such stereotypical remarks. She also had to learn to work with her male colleagues without bruising their egos.\n\n\u201cThe male ego is very interesting, if we\u2019re all working on a problem and I arrive at the solution first, I can\u2019t announce it because it\u2019ll come off as a show-off. I had to learn to bring everyone to my way of thinking and then have us arrive at the solution together.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the department got promoted\n\nHaving proved herself on the job, she decided to apply for an opening for the role of head of electronic banking \u2014 naturally, she expected to get the job. At the interview, she noticed something was off, the interviewer first verified she was in the right place and then went on to ask her non-work related questions.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me the benefit of doubt. He felt that I couldn\u2019t be the head of electronic banking. I was devastated.\u201d\n\nWhile sharing her awkward interview experience with a colleague, she mentioned her grade level at the bank. It was then she learnt that her colleagues were on higher grades than her and she was the lowest paid in the department.\n\n\u201cI was the lowest-paid not because I was female but because I didn\u2019t know how to negotiate. They don\u2019t tell women on the continent how to negotiate, you don\u2019t ask for more. While growing up, you take what you\u2019re given, smile and say thank you. There\u2019s nothing like asking for more. That\u2019s insolent behaviour.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, she requested to be promoted to a particular grade or she\u2019ll resign. Her request was granted but ironically, her colleagues were also promoted to make it seem like a general department-wide promotion.\n\nThe Apprentice Africa\n\nIn the midst of all this, she took unpaid leave to participate in a reality TV show The Apprentice Africa; for her, it was an opportunity to get an MBA training. She didn\u2019t win the competition but it equipped her with a valuable understanding of business concepts and showed her a glimpse of how reality TV shows work.\n\n\u201cI was a resource person but I didn\u2019t assert myself, I was a bit shy. The thing with reality TV is that they create characters. They only edit it and show places of you behaving in a particular way. If you\u2019re loud, they show that, if you\u2019re quiet that\u2019s what they show.\u201d\n\nThe participants of The Apprentice Africa. Don\u2019t bother looking for Regina Honu, she\u2019s not in this picture.\n\nUpon leaving the show, she remembers that one of the crew persons walked up to her and said she\u2019ll be a great team player but not a leader.\n\n\u201cI was like hmm, maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nShe got an offer to work for Bank PHB, headline sponsor of the show, but couldn\u2019t imagine living in the fast-paced Lagos, so she returned back to Ghana.\n\nSame experience at another bank and turning away from a job at Microsoft\n\nShe eventually left Zenith bank for Fidelity bank, a Ghanaian Bank. And it was the same experience all over again.\n\nIt was at this point that the idea to start her own company came but she shelved it at first.\n\n\u201cI always say I put a snooze button on my dream. I thought entrepreneurs are born but not trained. There are people who are born with charisma and are bold. I never saw myself that way.\u201d\n\nWhile at the bank, she got an opportunity to interview at Microsoft. She went through the process and got to travel to Seattle at Microsoft head office. While waiting for her turn, she made up her mind that she\u2019ll return to Ghana to build something.\n\nResigning from her Job\n\nThe morning of the day Honu resigned from her job, she didn\u2019t know it would happen. She was used to a certain comfortable life, earning a decent salary, but she wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cI told my friends that I wanted to resign and they were like no, it\u2019s a bad idea, don\u2019t be stupid. Bonus is coming. I just had that feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it that day. I won\u2019t have the courage to do that again.\u201d\n\nSo she took the jump, resigned, bought a computer and desktop to start training kids.\n\nShe also decided to move back to her parent\u2019s house to reduce costs and increase her runway. That was the start of Soronko Academy.\n\nRegina working with some students at Soronko Academy\n\nFinding the right kind of love\n\nAfter calling off a three-year-long relationship with a guy, who was putting up with her. Honu wasn\u2019t sure she might find the right man and was ready to make peace with that.\n\n\u201cHe felt that as soon as he put a ring on it, I\u2019ll start behaving like a typical Ghanaian woman. I remember attending a particular event where everyone kept coming to me and it was as if he was invisible. He was so angry. I started seeing that he couldn\u2019t deal with a woman who would outshine him.\u201d\n\nShe eventually met her husband on an interview set, a South African who was on holiday in Ghana. In 2015, they got married.\n\nRichard and Regina Honu on their wedding day. Photo Credit: Regina Honu\n\n\u201cI always advise women that who we marry is important, it makes a difference. The fact that my husband is supportive allows me to be different.\u201d\n\nThese days she spends her free time with her husband and daughter.\n\n10 years and counting\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since Honu started Soronko Academy, for her there\u2019s still so much more to do. She\u2019s looking to get a bigger space in order to accommodate more women and run a residential program.\n\nThese days her number one pet peeve is people asking her to do something else, that\u2019s she has done enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now doing some programs in the other Ghanaian regions and some women don\u2019t have an idea of what an email address is. So we still have a long way to go, we shouldn\u2019t count the minorities and privileged as progress.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us. Our legal and government relations teams are looking into it but we thought it was important to let you know that your money remains safe with Bamboo and will always be readily accessible. \u2014 Bamboo (@investbamboo) August 17, 2021\n\nSo far none of the affected companies has come out to refute this claim. This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement. It took a lot of explaining and convincing to get users to trust that their money was safe and the activities of the fintech platform is legal. This recent announcement would cause massive reputational damage.\n\nTechCabal has reached out to the affected fintech companies and is awaiting their comments.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Nigerian startup checks out of Afghanistan post Taliban takeover",
          "text": "Yesterday, a horrific video from Afghanistan broke the internet. Hundreds of Afghans, in a desperate bid to flee the country, were captured in the footage running after and clinging to the body of a US Air Force plane as it prepared to depart Kabul airport.\n\nOver the weekend, the Taliban hijacked the government and assumed total control of the capital city\u2014 it wasn\u2019t long before they had the whole country to themselves. The central government was disbanded; Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan fled the scene unannounced, leaving what remained of his administration in the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nAfghani citizens aren\u2019t the only ones affected by the current crisis. African entrepreneurs and skilled workers who run operations in Kabul are also dealing with the consequences of the Taliban\u2019s actions. How are they coping with this heat? Are they packing their loads and fleeing or are they staying put to see where the leaf drops?\n\nLast year Olumuyiwa Olowogboyega, former senior reporter, TechCabal, interviewed Vincent, a Nigeria Cybersecurity expatriate working out of Kabul, who described Afghanistan as a city on the edge, an unstable mountainous city with two presidents.\n\nMore recently, Chekkit, a Nigerian authentication and product tracking startup, expanded to Afghanistan after landing a partnership with the Afghanistan Ministry of Health to help in combating the endemic counterfeit medicine products in the country.\n\nIn a conversation with Tosin Adelowo, Chekkit CMO, I asked: why Afghanistan? Tosin disclosed that the country was urgently looking for a solution to the counterfeit market plaguing its cities and streets and \u201cChekkit has the perfect solution to the problem\u201d and that, alongside other brokering factors, is a major determinant of the expansion.\n\nAfter a successful pilot of Chekkit\u2019s drug verification solution in collaboration with their blockchain partner, Fantom Foundation (which was the major broker of the deal), the Afghanistan Ministry of Health announced the rollout of the service nationally on the 2nd of May 2021.\n\nNow, a little over three months later, Chekkit is pulling the plug on all its operations in Afghanistan. Their exit wasn\u2019t much of a decision as all their partners have been forced to exit the country.\n\n\u201cWe have discontinued our communication/operation in the region as our partners have also exited the region due to the civil unrest,\u201d Adelowo told TechCabal in an email. \u201dOur heart is with the people of Afghanistan and we pray for strength for them to withstand and surpass the current issues.\u201d\n\nChekkit\u2019s exit is just the beginning of a series of backward movements that are expected to happen in Afghanistan as a result of this unrest. And in the absence of Chekkit\u2019s solutions, and similar solutions in the market, there\u2019s a likelihood that counterfeit products will return with unchecked and unverified vengeance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSince the takeover, different analyses have been released on the impact it will have on trade and economy of the country. According to Times Now, the Afghan economy has been reliant on international aid with a limited private sector. Nearly half (around 44%) of its workforce is in agriculture. Observers predict that with the Taliban in control, international trade will come to a standstill, leading to a surge in smuggling.\n\nThe prediction is already happening, we can see that international businesses and organisations are already closing shops and evacuating their people. Though after the capital takeover, the Taliban announced that the war is now over, can the dust settle that easily?\n\n\u201cToday is a great day for the Afghan people and the Mujahideen. They have witnessed the fruits of their efforts and their sacrifices for 20 years,\u201d Mohammad Naeem, the spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s political office, told Al Jazeera TV.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Businesses could be back on the brink of scrambling for strategies to escape the weight of an economy at standstill as the surge of COVID-19 third wave brings Nigeria closer to a possible lockdown decision.\n\nThe peak of Nigeria\u2019s third wave of Covid-19 pandemic has begun, disease experts confirm, predicting that further rise in infections should be expected in the coming days as weak compliance with preventive measures persist.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported a 222 percent rise in infections on Wednesday as 1, 149 new cases were confirmed.\n\nThe spike following a daily average of 560 infections since the beginning of August marks the start of what experts describe as a peaking curve, which they say isn\u2019t shocking since community spread of the virus has continued and importation through in-bound travellers keep pacing.\n\nIf the rate of new infections blows out of the government\u2019s control, businesses still struggling to match their growth with pre-pandemic levels could lose current gains of recovery.\n\nThe last time Nigeria saw a similar amount of single-daily infections was in December 2020 (1,145 cases) just as the second wave of the pandemic began to peak towards 2,314.\n\nOyewale Tomori, a professor of virology in a chat with BusinessDay wondered why many Nigerians still do not believe the COVID-19 virus is circulating in the country despite rising numbers from only one-third of the 36 states.\n\nCaution has been thrown to the wind since governments lifted lockdown and eased activities in many sectors of the economy. People stopped wearing masks, hand-washing basins have disappeared in public places and physical distancing are not maintained except in some corporate organisations.\n\nThe rising cases are especially bad news for business entities in Lagos state where a majority of the cases (37.6 percent) come from and has the potential to be hardest hit by any severe measure taken to stop the virus in its tracks.\n\n\u201cThe virus-like mobile phone is immobile until human beings move it around and allow the virus to mutate and become variants of concern. Masks can stop the virus in its tracts including the variants,\u201d Tomori, former vice-chancellor of Bowen University told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cMore important than government regulation and guidelines is the compliance by the citizens. We, the people, play a more important role than the government in covid19 control.\u201d\n\nThe first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and the economic meltdown that followed had companies experience little or no sales, leading to expiration, damage of inventories and reduction in prices in some cases.\n\nIn other instances, a complete shutdown of operations resulted in idle property, demand and revenue decline for companies, increase in operating costs and fall in share prices amongst others, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an international consulting firm said in a report on key financial reporting implications of COVID-19 on organisations in Nigeria.\n\nApart from those in the telecommunication and digital entertainment industries that experienced a significant increase in revenue from increased demand for voice and data services, most others saw declining revenue, affecting employees.\n\nRead also: Covid-19: African Alliance says its Business Continuity Management key to sustainable operations\n\nA survey conducted by the Centre for Economic Policy Research in March indicated that traders had virtually zero revenue during a month-long lockdown.\n\nAnd even though sales rebounded more than employment after reopening, neither returned to pre-pandemic levels. Traders reported low sales, lack of cash on hand, and challenges with sourcing as significant problems facing their business.\n\n\u201cAlthough most traders raised their prices to cope with the impacts, very few took out loans. Traders are interested in new strategies to cope with low demand and supply challenges. Policies to facilitate traders\u2019 access to e-commerce and remote sales, as well as strategies to improve supply chain failures could help address these issues,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe country has seen substantial relaxation in containment measures locally and internationally, which has supported the resumption of commercial and trade activities and spurred a modest economic performance in the first half.\n\nSome considerable increases in trade volume have been recorded since the start of the year, amid a low vaccination rate, with Nigeria\u2019s trade with the global community, for instance, rising to around N9 trillion between January and March this year.\n\nSimilarly, the scale of contraction in the Nigerian trade sector moderated from a double-digit to a single digit in the first quarter.\n\nIf these gains must be protected, a lockdown situation must be averted.\n\nAlthough the federal government on Thursday ruled out a third lockdown over the presence of the Delta variant of coronavirus in the country, saying that the current threats are not at a level where another national shutdown will be considered.\n\nIf need be, he said it would be a precision lockdown.\n\nOsagie Ehanire, Health minister said that apart from the vaccines sourced free of charge, Nigeria has paid for about 30 million doses of Johnson & Johnson doses.\n\n\u201cLockdown is the last measure that countries have taken because our lockdown stifles economic activity, restricts your own freedom and your business \u2013 both corporate business, government business, private business are affected,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\n\u201c\u2026when we were compelled to have that lockdown at the beginning we learnt a lot of lessons. We are not at the level yet where we are feeling that threat to do any lockdown,\u201d\n\nIn a mailed response to BusinessDay, Chikwe Ihekweazu, NCDC director-general said the recent increases in COVID-19 infections which has been associated with the Delta variant of the virus in most countries has more to do with the resumption of social gatherings with poor adherence to public health and social measures in Nigeria.\n\nThe situation, he said, highlights the urgent need for Nigerians to take personal and collective responsibility, noting that the pandemic is not over.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we recognise the risk the virus poses and adhere to the known preventive measures by avoiding large gatherings, wearing a face mask properly in public settings, washing hands regularly with clean water and soap or using alcohol-based hand sanitiser where the former is unavailable,\u201d Ihekweazu said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has announced plans to move on with the contentious issue of grazing reserves for the benefit of nomadic cattle rearers across the federation.\n\nThis is despite opposition by several regional groups and state governors who continue to insist that they do not have lands in their states for such project.\n\nThe issues of creating grazing reserves for Fulani herdsmen across the country has remained very contentious with many groups across the country insisting that it\u2019s a ploy to grab land from indigenous people and resettle Fulani population.\n\nHowever, despite the opposition, the president appears determined to push ahead with the idea.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by the president\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said the president has approved the review of 368 grazing sites across 25 states of the federation.\n\nThe full statement reads: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved recommendations of a committee to review \u201cwith dispatch\u201d, 368 grazing sites, across 25 states in the country, \u201cto determine the levels of encroachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s directive followed his approval of the recommendations of a committee chaired by the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.\n\n\u201cAmong others, the committee had recommended the collection of field data collection on 368 Grazing Reserves across 25 states to assess encroachment and encroachers, stakeholder engagements and sensitization.\n\n\u201cThe Committee also recommended production of maps and geo-mapping/tagging of sites, analysis of findings and report preparations as well as design appropriate communication on Grazing Reserves and operations.\n\n\u201cThe number of the Grazing Reserves and States were deduced from considerations of existing security concerns and other pre-existing socio-economic conditions.\n\n\u201cThe President directed that the assignment be undertaken with dispatch to bring more understanding on the Grazing Reserves, and implementation.\n\n\u201cMembers of the committee include, Governor of Kebbi State and Vice Chairman, National Food Security Council, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, Governor of Ebonyi State and Chairman of NEC Sub-Committee for National Livestock Transformation Plan, David Umahi, Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, Minister of Environment, Dr. Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar and Deputy Chief of Staff, Ade Ipaye.\n\n\u201cThe Technical Sub-Committee consists of representatives from the seven members of the main committee in addition to representatives from Ministry of Justice, Surveyor General of the Federation, National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) and National Space Research Development Agency (NASRDA).\n\n\u201cAmong its Terms of Reference, the Committee was to collate from states and confirm the status of all Grazing Reserves, assess the percentage of available land and those with existing encroachment complications for case-by-case resolution in partnership with state governments and the FCT.\n\n\u201cThe Committee will also make recommendations for gazetting of ungazetted Grazing Reserves and create a data base of National Cattle Herders and ensure that Grazing Reserves are well communicated to all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe inaugural meeting of the Committee was held on May 10, 2021.\u201d",

          "text": "As the world observes World Humanitarian Day on Thursday, 19 August, it is important to note that this day was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2009 in memory of the 19 August 2003 bomb attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, Iraq, which killed 22 people, including the chief humanitarian in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello.\n\nEach year, this day is observed in honour of all humanitarians going to extraordinary lengths to support various causes, and also to remember those who lost their lives working for humanitarian causes.\n\nThis year\u2019s theme according to the UN is #TheHumanRace, which is based on global challenge for climate action in solidarity with the people who need it most.\n\nClimate change has been a major item of discuss among western nations and especially when they meet either at the United Nations General Assembly, G20 or G8.\n\nNigeria is not excluded from the effects of climate change, as we have noticed; increased temperature, polluted rainwater, variable rainfall, rise in sea level and flooding, drought and desertification, low crop yield leading to food shortage.\n\nRemember, in 2019, the National Emergency Management Agency revealed that floods had displaced approximately 1.9 million Nigerians and it is expected that more will be displaced this year.\n\nThese effects are caused by human activities; it is more like mankind is waging war against nature and nature is fighting back.\n\nSome of those human activities include: emission of greenhouse gases from vehicles, burning of hydrocarbon products, mining, deforestation, over-exploitation of the soil, industrial emission, gas flaring, indiscriminate dumping of refuse, etc.\n\nCurrently, in many parts of the Niger Delta, the rainwater is no longer colourless and odourless but blackish, which is considered dangerous for domestic use. Do children still play under the rain? That is quite dangerous and unhealthy right now in that region.\n\nGas flaring introduces toxic pollutants such as sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which leads to environmental problems such as acid rain.\n\nAlso, gas flaring is a major source of greenhouse gases (GHG) contributing to global warming which accelerates the problem of climate change and harsh living conditions in the country.\n\nTo save the environment and humanity, the Nigerian government needs to stop postposing the doomsday and end gas flaring.\n\nEarlier this year, Minister of state petroleum, Timipre Sylva said the federal government is now committed to eliminating gas flaring by 2025, after the government in 2016 extended the deadline to end gas flaring in 2020.\n\nAccording to NOSDRA, a government-run satellite tracker, in 2020 alone natural gas valued at $1.24 billion was burned by oil companies, one which could generate the annual electricity use of Nigerians.\n\nRenewable sources of energy such as sunlight, wind, geothermal heat, biomass should be encouraged and embraced. The country should carry out sustainable transportation methods that align with environmental requirements and reduce carbon footprint.\n\nIndustrial and household waste should not be dumped indiscriminately and also adopt production methods to our consumption patterns to help reduce waste. The culture of recycling waste should be enforced and limitations must imposed on industry emissions and waste.\n\nOceans and seas are the largest storage of greenhouse gases and are an exceptional support system for life on this planet, and therefore, limiting overfishing, unsustainable development activities in coastal areas and the consumption of environmentally friendly products is now essential.\n\nBefore an infrastructural project is carried out, environmental impact assessment should be thoroughly conducted. The Ministries of environment at various government levels should not exist on paper only but get to work effectively to salvage mankind from these dangers.\n\nIn this race against the climate crisis, Nigeria cannot allow herself to be left behind.\n\nEnyene Vincent is a journalist and good governance advocate. You can reach him on Twitter: @iamenyene.",

          "title": "Buhari to security Chiefs: I won\u2019t exit office a failure",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered heads of security agencies in the country to address the alarming insecurity in the country, saying he is not prepared to exit office as a failure.\n\nHe spoke at a meeting of the National Security Council held at the Presidential Villa Abuja Thursday.\n\nAddressing State House correspondents at the end of the meeting, National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (retd), quoted the president as saying he would make fresh changes in the country\u2019s security architecture, if necessary, to turn things around in the various theatres of operation in the ongoing war against insecurity.\n\nHe said President Buhari was largely briefed on the successes recorded in the operations in the North-east, especially the large number of Boko Haram insurgents surrendering to government troops there.\n\nSurrendering insurgents\n\nHe said the Boko Haram fighters were leaving the terrorist camp in droves as a result of the relentless activities of the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe last National Security Council meeting we had was on the 8th of June. From that time till now, a lot has happened within the security domain. Mr. President called for this meeting. And it was actually supposed to be for next week, but he drew it back for today, for obvious reasons.\n\n\u201cThe meeting briefed Mr. President on the current security situation in the country. Well, I\u2019ll say from the last time we met till now, and all the issues that were brought before the president, were mainly issues arising from the successes recorded in the theatre of operations throughout the North East.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that a lot of successes have been recorded. Large numbers of people are surrendering in the north east as a consequence of the relentless efforts of the Armed Forces, intelligence and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThis is very, very evident. We\u2019ve never had such large numbers of people defecting from the other side, back to the Nigerian side, mainly, as a result of many issues within the theatre, issues of infighting among the various factions of the terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cBut with the new drive of the Armed Forces, the police, the intelligence agencies, there have been greatest cooperation, greater synergy in intelligence sharing, as well as our partners in the regional intelligence fusion unit.\n\n\u201cSo, the president was briefed, the president is quite happy that there\u2019s been tremendous success, especially with the advent of the new service chiefs and Inspector General of Police. And he\u2019s also made it very, very clear that he\u2019s not ready to exit government as a failure. He is not going to tolerate failure and that he\u2019s made changes and is ready to make further changes if he is not satisfied.\n\n\u201cHe is completely determined to ensure that there\u2019s a turnaround in the fortunes in the theatre of operations. We also addressed the issue of the prevailing situation, which is widespread, you know, issues of hunger,\u201d Monguno said.\n\nPlans for repentant fighters\n\nThe NSA also told journalists that government had plans for the large number of Boko Haram insurgents that surrendered.\n\n\u201cYes, there are plans. But I don\u2019t want to immediately divulge what has been decided on those plans till the President takes a firm decision on the plans.\n\n\u201cBut definitely that is one of the things that he intends to address, the number of people coming. And it\u2019s not just in Nigeria, even in northern Cameroon, you have equally large numbers of people surrendering to the bonafide agencies of government. But that is all as a consequence of the regional cooperation between the various countries and the agencies of those countries,\u201d he said.\n\nOn hunger in the land\n\nOn the widespread hunger and pains among Nigerians, he said: \u201cThe President is not oblivious of the pains of the people, and is working with the Vice President and other members of council. He is going to employ the relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government to address this issue.\n\n\u201cAs far as he is concerned, it\u2019s also an emergency situation that people should not be left to wallow in hunger, and in despair, this is something that he\u2019s also going to look into. And he\u2019s going to use all the necessary, all the relevant tools at his disposal to address the issue of widespread hunger.\u201d\n\nNorth-west\n\nThe NSA also said the meeting dwelt on the security challenge in the North-west.\n\n\u201cAnd then also the issue of insecurity in the northwest, which is still, even though for those of us who are within the security system, we have seen a significant drop in the number of incidents of kidnapping and banditry, nevertheless, a lot has to be done. Because like I\u2019ve always said in the past, as far as the people are concerned, there shouldn\u2019t be any incident of kidnapping, banditry, and other incidents of insecurity.\n\n\u201cSo, the president is also aware of that and he has also made certain assertions which I am not willing to say right now, till he\u2019s made the final decision on those things. But generally, the atmosphere is improving, especially in the north eastern part of the country. The president is very, very happy with the drive in that part of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPlateau killings\n\nThe NSA said the meeting also deliberated on the recent killings in Plateau state.\n\nHe said while President Buhari lauded Governor Simon Lalong for his efforts at bringing the situation under control, he charged security agencies to step up and restore normalcy to the troubled spots across the state.\n\nThe NSA said there was the need for Nigerians to forge a sense of oneness, unity, and put aside whatever suspicions, apprehensions or agitations that exist.\n\n\u201cIn the context of the 21st century, you can\u2019t deal with these emerging crises in a cut and dried manner. We have to use everything at our disposal, all the elements of national power, including the population, the wider community needs to work with the security agencies to deal with these problems.\n\n\u201cResponses have to be fast. We can\u2019t act on stale intelligence. And that is why as things are happening, right from the grassroots level going all the way up, the local government, the state governments, and then of course, the federal government has its own parts to play.\n\n\u201cPeople should not cover for those who they have identified, unscrupulous, undesirable people, it is very, very important that we share because in today\u2019s context, the highest value intelligence doesn\u2019t necessarily need to come from the agencies of government. It could come from any other tangential organisation, institution or group,\u201d he said.\n\nWe are not failed state -Lai\n\nAnd further to this, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has said Nigeria is not a failed state and cannot go the way of Afghanistan where the Taliban took the rein of power.\n\nThe minister stated this in Washington DC during his engagements with international media organizations, including the BBC Radio and Television, Bloomberg and Politico.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports the minister is in the U.S. to meet with international media organisations and think tanks on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and efforts made so far in tackling insurgency, banditry and all form of criminality.\n\nSpeaking with NAN after his respective meeting with the three media organisations, Mohammed said insinuation in certain quarter that the security situation in Nigeria could degenerate to that of Afghanistan was not correct.\n\nHe said Nigeria was winning the war against terror and the country cannot go the way of Afghanistan where Taliban, a terrorist group took over power.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cNigeria is not and will not be a failed state. Yes, we have challenges in some corners of the country but that has not made Nigeria a failed state.\n\n\u201cA failed state is one where basic facilities are not available and everything has broken down but, Nigeria is not in that stage.\u201d\n\nWhile insisting \u201cNigeria is not at war\u201d, the minister said fake news and disinformation were being used to portray the country in precarious situation.\n\nMohammed said the development in Afghanistan had proven right the position of President Buhari that when fighting an unconventional war; the country had to be resourceful.\n\n\u201cIf what happened in Afghanistan is something to go by, then the federal government should be given kudos for the way it has handled insurgency in the last couple of years.\n\n\u201cThe lessons from Afghanistan today is that for over 20 years of American intervention and over a trillion dollar spent and thousands of American lives lost, it took the Taliban just few weeks to recapture Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThis should be a lesson for everybody that when you are fighting an insurgency or movement driven by ideology, it is always difficult to overcome and you must be resourceful, deploying both kinetic and non-kinetic approach.\n\n\u201cWhen people were saying we should invite mercenaries, the president was focused and maintained that our military have what it takes.\n\n\u201cThe president should be given kudos for believing in our military and deploying both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said while a lot of efforts had been put on kinetic approach, the Nigerian military also engaged in non-kinetic approach, building hospitals, reviving schools, teaching in some of the schools and delivering medical care to people in the affected areas.\n\nHe said the non-kinetic approach to fighting insurgency in the North-east had led to droves of insurgents coming out to surrender arms and pledging their loyalty to the government.\n\nMohammed also said with the recent development of many Boko Haram coming out voluntarily to surrender their arms, the country is winning the war against insurgency.\n\nOn banditry, the minister said bandits were now suffering more casualties than ever before.\n\nHe assured that the delivery of the Super Tucano military platforms by U.S. to the military would be a game changer in the fight against banditry.

Anya, in his remarks, noted that Nigeria must aim at double digits economic growth and single-digit inflation, adding that it is only when the country\u2019s economy grows at 7.5 percent of GDP per annum that the country can overcome some of its challenges and induce competitiveness.\n\nAnya said the reason Nigeria must keep its inflation down is that the high unemployment and poverty rates in the country cannot be managed except its inflation is brought down.\n\nAlso speaking, the Chairman of the RDSC, Prof Njida Gadzama, said given the potentials Nigeria has, the country deserves to be better than it is.\n\nGadzama, who lamented that the country imports virtually everything, called on all Nigerians to lay aside their differences, unite and develop the country.\n\nOn the insecurity in the country, he noted that the nation must return to the era when it used to manufacture its own military weapons such as rifles.\n\nIn a presentation, a Professor of Agronomy at Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Prof Ali Garba, noted that the manufacturing sector accounts for only 11 percent of the country\u2019s economy as of 2019, adding that manufacturing in Nigeria is hindered by the poor power supply, government policies, among others.\n\nWhile giving a breakdown of Nigeria\u2019s economic performance, Garba said the country\u2019s largest export sector is crude petroleum with 76 percent, while petroleum gas has 14 percent and agricultural products 22 percent.\n\nHe lamented that as of 1980, Nigeria used to refine its crude, and all vehicles were assembled in Nigeria but now they are all imported, stating that agriculture and the industry are important mutual partners in the industrialization process.\n\nAccording to him, adequate infrastructural development such as good road networks and electricity were very critical to the country\u2019s quest for industrialization.\n\nOn defense and military, he said if the defense could step up its security investment in the country will improve and industrialization will take place, adding that military equipment can also be manufactured locally.\n\nHe said industrialization in Nigeria was the solution to unemployment and poverty, while noting that all counties that developed were at one point suffering from unemployment until they achieved industrialization.",

          "title": "Shagari prevented lawmakers from hijacking NASS bureaucracy -CNA -NigPilot",
          "text": "Clerk to the National Assembly, CNA, Architect Amos Olatunde Ojo , yesterday disclosed in Abuja that it was late President Shehu Shagari who prevented serving lawmakers from making themselves members of the National Assembly Service Commission, NASC.\n\nReceiving a delegation of the Committee on Administration and Human Resources of Ghana Parliamentary Service Board in his office, Ojo informed that the National Assembly and its operational bureaucracies are all independent institutions on their own.\n\nAccording to him, the Second Republic Senate Leader, late Senator Olusola Saraki, made the proposal to President Shagari which he however turned down by asking the then serving senators and members of the House of Representatives to choose between being members of the commission and serving lawmakers.\n\nHe said: \u201cBetween 1979 and 1985, politicians tended to act in the military fashion rather than exhibiting democratic traits.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in 1981 when the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria initiated a bill for an Act to establish the National Assembly Service Commission, the then-Senate Leader, Senator Olusola Saraki was said to have proposed that members of the commission be composed of senators and members of the House of Representatives serving at the time.\n\n\u201cWhen the proposal got to President Shehu Shagari, he asked the members of the National Assembly to choose between being members of the National Assembly and members of the National Assembly Service Commission.\n\n\u201cHowever, the legislative proposal for the commission\u2019s establishment did not see the light of the day during the Shagari\u2019s administration, perhaps due to the sudden military takeover of power in December 1983.\u201d\n\nThe Clerk, who went down the memory lane on how parliamentary bureaucracy in Nigeria was treated like an appendage of the executive arm of government until 2000 when the National Assembly Service Commission was created, told the Ghanaian delegation that both the National Assembly and its operational bureaucracies are now independent institutions on their own.\n\n\u201cIn 1983, the National Assembly was again suspended until 1993 when General Ibrahim Babangida ousted Buhari. Before then, General Ibrahim Babangida had in 1988 through Decree 48 of 1988 directed the creation of departments in various ministries of government, and National Assembly was created as a department in the Presidency.\n\n\u201cSadly, whenever the military took power and set aside the constitution, staff of the National Assembly who usually was drawn from different agencies of the executive returned to their parent ministries, hence there was nothing to build the structure of the legislative bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cWith Abacha as Head of State and the suspension of the political arm of the National Assembly, the National Assembly bureaucracy was seen as one of the departments in the Villa following Decree 48 of 1988.\n\n\u201cThe staff of the legislature was appointed through the office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, while the National Assembly\u2019s official address was the Presidency.\n\n\u201cThe bureaucracy head of the National Assembly was addressed as Director.

In no area is this challenge more felt than in the bureaucracy of the legislature.

          "text": "Osaze Osemwingie-Ero, a former Edo State Commissioner for Arts, Culture, Tourism and Diaspora Affairs, has cried out regarding the plight of over 300 Nigerian youths \u2018illegally\u2019 detained in Italian prisons for contrived charges on mafia-related offences.\n\nAt a meeting with officials of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Mr Osemwingie-Ero disclosed that he learned about the plight of the innocent young Nigerians during his wrongful detention in Italy.\n\nAccording to the former commissioner, the young Nigerians are held in Italian maximum prisons because they do not have the resources to access an independent lawyer.\n\nHe said the prosecutors in Italy were manipulating the justice system against Nigerians, adding that it became clear to him that \u201che was a victim of racial discrimination, and manipulation of the Italian Justice System by a very corrupt prosecutor \u2013 Dr Stephano Casano\u201d.\n\nNarrating briefly his ordeal in Italy, Osemwingie-Ero said when he interviewed other Nigerians who were incarcerated for charges similar to those levelled against him, it was discovered that a certain \u2018Green Bible\u2019 and forged papers that were brought up as evidence against the commissioner, was the same evidence put forward against the others in custody.\n\nConnecting Flight, Article 416 and the Green Bible\n\nWhen in 2019, Osemwingie-Ero was getting aboard a connecting flight from Amsterdam to Germany, he could never have known that his brief trip would become an Odyssey Journey of 18 months in an Italian prison, for a crime he knew nothing about.\n\nHe was to meet with Yusuf Tuggar, the then Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, and the business was simply \u2013 the Benin Artifacts Campaign.\n\nAt the airport, security operatives picked him up, and swiftly, he was accused of being a member of what the Italian prosecutors called the \u2018Nigerian Mafia\u2019.\n\nArticle 416 Bis of the Italian Criminal Code outlines what a Mafia-type organization is and the punishment for perpetrators of these kinds of crimes.\n\nAccording to the former commissioner, it is upon article 416 that many Nigerians are being detained in Italy, with no solid evidence of any crime committed.\n\nEnters then a forged manual called the Green Bible.\n\nOsemwingie-Ero said in a bid to add flesh to their accusations, the Italians produced in court, an evidence known as the Green Bible, which has been used to convict many Nigerians, especially those who had no qualitative legal representation.\n\n\u201cI decided to do the long trial, where the prosecutor was compelled to bring the evidence that he had against me or against the Nigerian association. Only for him to produce a forge manual that he called the Green Bible, which they have used to convict a lot of Nigerians over 200 Nigerians in Italy,\u201d Osemwingie-Ero narrated.\n\nHe and his lawyers thoroughly went through the Green Bible and discovered myriads of discrepancies.\n\n\u201cFor example, page 14 of that so called Green Bible, paragraph 3 stated that \u2018we the criminal organization\u2019 involve in A-Z were there; and I told the judge that I have never seen an organization that will write in their manual that they are a criminal organization.\n\n\u201cOn page 31, 32 and 33 of that so called Green Bible, we have a 2017 event of the communique of the Green Circuit Association in Asaba in that book while on page 51 of that so called Green Bible, it said this book was written in 1978 by University of Benin students and I said, how can we have a communique of 2017 event inside a book that was written in 1978,\u201d the former commissioner pointed out.\n\nAppeal for young Nigerians unjustly detained\n\nMr Osemwingie-Ero called for the collaboration of all stakeholders including the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and the media, among others to ensure the release of Nigerians unjustly detained in Italy, some of them facing up to 140years in prison.\n\n\u201cWhile I was there on the 28th of October, 70 Nigerians were arrested for the same Mafia related offences and the only thing they showed on the television was a kitchen knife as a proof of evidence. Meanwhile, they still use this article 416 bis of the Italian Mafia Criminal Code.\n\n\u201cOn the 26th of September while I was still in prison, 20 Nigerians were convicted and sentenced to 140years in prison, they were convicted with this same forged Green Bible, I have a copy of it, this same Green Bible was what they used, and if you google Torino Chronicle of September 26, 2020 (page 8), you will see it there clearly.\n\n\u201cTheir appeal is coming up on the 20th of September this year, after two years in prison, maximum security in Italy. The 70 Nigerians that were arrested, their trial is starting on the 17th of September this year as well.\n\n\u201cI am aware because I kept interacting with them, knowing more about the case before I was released on the 29th of May.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, his release was by God\u2019s grace, adding that it cost him a lot of money to get good legal representation which these other Nigerians do not have at the moment.\n\nOsemwingie-Ero who said he made a promise that he was going to create awareness for the release of those innocent Nigerians, expressed disappointment in \u2018the fact\u2019 that he did not get the support that he expected from the Nigerian government.\n\nHe explained that his then boss Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State called the Minister of Foreign Affairs to notify him of the Commissioner\u2019s arrest and nothing was done to follow up the case.\n\n\u201cIf that could happen to me, you can imagine the fate of ordinary Nigerians?\u201d Osemwingie-Ero asked.\n\nTurning the focus away from his plight in Italy, the former commissioner told the Chairman/CEO of NIDCOM, Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, that he had come to notify the Commission of the predicaments of those Nigerians languishing in prison, held under article 416 bis of the Italian Mafia Criminal Code without any single evidence of those crimes committed.\n\nOn the next step of his advocacy, Osemwingie-Ero said he alongside his friends and family members will hold a protest next week, in front of the Italian Embassy, to let the world know \u201cof the injustice that is being meted on us and those innocent Nigerians in prison\u201d.\n\n\u2018We will take it up\u2019\n\nIn reaction to the ordeal he had narrated, Hon Dabiri-Erewa commiserated with the former Edo State Commissioner for Arts, Culture, Tourism and Diaspora Affairs.\n\nThe NIDCOM CEO while emphasizing that key thing at the moment is the plight of Nigerians who the commissioner met in the Italian prison, explained that the first step would be to take up the case with the Attorney General\u2019s office, as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nMs. Dabiri-Erewa said there are many cases of this nature that the AGF, Abubakar Malami handles, and that this case will be treated with the urgency that it deserves.\n\n\u201cIndeed if there are so many Nigerians in Italian prisons languishing for years, for an offence (they told you and you interacted with them) that they did not commit, we can\u2019t just watch and see that happen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NIDCOM Chairman, the Commission will be thorough about the case, adding that every legal avenue will be explored.",

The country is seeking partners to invest in a $2.5 billion initiative to build more than a dozen renewable energy-powered desalination plants by 2025.\n\nThe wealth fund targets taking a minority stake in all the plants alongside the winning bidders\u201d.\n\nThe Arab world\u2019s most populous nation relies on the Nile River for almost all its fresh water and is confronting a yawning supply deficit that officials fear will be worsened by a giant hydropower dam Ethiopia is filling on the main tributary.\n\nPopulation growth and climate change have also made Egypt vulnerable to water scarcity. The world needs to spend $6.7 trillion on water infrastructure by 2030, according to the United Nations, which says that around 1.2 billion people already live in areas of physical shortages.\n\nEgypt, which needs about 114 billion cubic meters of water each year to cater for its more than 100 million people, receives only about half that from natural sources, according to the Irrigation Ministry. It addresses the shortfall by steps including recycling agricultural wastewater and groundwater and importing extra food instead of irrigating more crops.\n\nThe 17 plants, which are targeted to produce a combined 2.8 million cubic meters of desalinated water per day, are part of a broader plan to add 6.4 million cubic meters of daily capacity by 2050, Soliman said.\n\nThe ministries of housing, planning, finance and electricity are all involved, and the government will be the off-taker for the desalinated water at \u201ccompetitive tariffs.\u201d\n\nEgypt was operating 76 desalination plants able to produce nearly 832,000 cubic meters per day as of May, according to the state-run Ahram Online news website.\n\nEgypt\u2019s first-ever sovereign fund, which was established in 2018, is modeled after initiatives in Malaysia and India. The fund aims to partner with the private sector and generate additional wealth from under-utilized state assets that it plans to manage.",
