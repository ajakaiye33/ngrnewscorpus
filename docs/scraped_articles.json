          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nA Non-profit organization and rights advocacy group, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has accused security agencies of allegedly faking killings of terrorists operating in the South-East while simultaneously carrying out actual killings \u201cof many Igbo youths\u201d in the zone.\n\nThis is as the rights group called on the Imo state Police Commissioner, Abutu Yaro to carry out thorough investigation to determine \u201cif the persons being paraded dead are actually the killers of the former Presidential aide to President Jonathan Mr. Ahmed Gulak who was gruesomely assassinated on Saturday in Owerri by men described as hoodlums.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by its Executive Director, Emmanuel Onwubiko, HURIWA said it is sad that \u201cupon the unfortunate incident of the killing of Gulak, there is no empirical evidence demonstrating that Nigerian Police Force deployed science- based, evidence-associated forensic probe of the crime scene but relied on what they said was the testimony of one of the survivors who was reportedly the cab driver who was driving the politician to the Sam Mbakwe International Airport before he met his unfortunate death.\u201d\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe police and soldiers are roaming about the streets of Owerri and somewhere in Enugu and even interrupted a church service just to arrest the entire congregation for being members of Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB. But armed Fulani herdsmen are having field days in Niger state, Benue state and North-West region of Nigeria killing, maiming, kidnapping and destroying citizens and their property but these same soldiers and police who are actually killing suspected members of IPOB including innocent Igbo youths, have always carried out \u201c audio\u201d and fake raids of Zamfara forests and Kaduna forests.\n\n\u201cThe police in Imo state blamed the dead man for his unfortunate fate because in their irrational word, Ahmed Gulak left his hostel room to the airport without informing the police and so, had no Police escorts. Now, the fact is that the acting Inspector General of Police had announced withdrawal of all police escorts attached to Very Important Persons, VIPs, in South-East and South-South as previously reported in the media. So how is the Commissioner of Police in Imo state blaming the victim of an unfortunate assassination for the cruel fate that befell him when it was the IGP who announced withdrawal of police escorts?\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cHow can any sane person accept hook, line and sinker, any conclusion reached by the Imo state police command that had blamed the dead man if the same police comes up as they have with the latest tale by moon light that the killers of Gulak have been killed based on hear say evidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce more, can we advocate the adoption of 21st century technology in fighting crimes to such an extent that the police be mandated to comply with global best practices in the steps they take to investigate crimes including the deployment of forensic investigative skills?\n\nOnwubiko further called on global leaders to speak up on the mindless killings going on in Nigeria, saying when pushed to the wall, defenseless people in the land may have no other option than to resort to self help.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nGOVERNOR Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, yesterday, urged the Federal Government to provide adequate funding for the 18 kilometre-Lagos-Badagry expressway re-construction project, and Apapa ports access roads, as well as other Federal road projects in the state.\n\nSanwo-Olu said this during a courtesy visit by the House of Representatives Committee on Works, led by its Chairman, Mr. Abubakar Abubakar, at the Lagos House, Ikeja.\n\nHe also tasked the Federal Government to speed up the construction of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cWe are happy with the level of work that has been done on the Apapa-Oshodi expressway but we need to do a lot of clean-up. There is still a side of the road that has not been completed. We know this is a special dispensation given the Order 8 that has been used but we can still go back and clean up the areas, especially around the Tin-Can Port and Apapa Port, so that we can free the traffic in all those areas and take it up to Ijora.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos-Badagry Expressway is one that I am aware of that doesn\u2019t have sufficient funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lagos-Badagry Expressway is an international gateway. We heard that Ghana, the Republic of Benin and Togo have completed their portion; it is a trans-West Africa corridor that five countries pass through. But it is only the Nigerian part of it that has not been fully fixed, which is from Seme border into Lagos and go straight to the port.\n\n\u201cBut Lagos, on its own, has leaped to start something. So, we are doing a 10-lanes highway and we have done almost 18 kilometers of that and we are taking it to a place called Okokomaiko.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting the Federal Government and the Federal Ministry of Works to push it and take it to Badagry. Our desire is for them to make it a 10-lanes highway. We are building for the future and we can put a rail in the middle of the corridor.\n\n\u201cWhen we are building for a future, we should not be scared. It is an international road and it can take a high level of traffic. That is one place we believe you will look into.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nWhile commending the Federal Ministry of Works\u2019 intervention on some of the federal roads in Lagos, urged FG to speedily consider the major failed portions of the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta Road and other Class A federal roads that are important in decongesting traffic out of Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are not leaving everything to Federal Government. We are also taking up the responsibility of trying to build the Fourth Mainland Bridge. We will work and collaborate with Federal Government at some point. It is a 37-kilometer ring road that is going to exit finally on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. It is audacious but we are looking to use the PPP model to be able to build it.\n\n\u201cWe believe that you should be able to see Phase One of it coming out before the end of this administration. We are not leaving anything to chance. We are doing 18-kilometer six-lane, rigid pavement in Lekki-Epe Expressway. We are doing 10 kilometers six-lane regional roads and several others. We are doing bridges and other constructions on our own. That is what can open up and free a city.\n\n\u201cWe are not just only doing that, we are pushing movement on our waterways. We are doing our rails so that we can have integrated mass transportation using rail, waterways and road connectivity in Lagos. We want everybody to come here to see that it is comparable to any city in the world. That is our plan.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Abubakar said his committee has reached out to the contractor in charge of the Marine and Eko Bridge and they promised that the project will be completed in four weeks, adding that the committee is also working on a new project in Lagos, which is Isolo-Mushin Road.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

He noted that the TTP only makes money when the system works.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have heard of the enforcement arm of the Task Force extorting money and we are trying to put a stop to that.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to fix the problem; we had a meeting with the Lagos State Government and they are changing the whole Task Force.

It is only in Nigeria that you want to convey containers from the port and you pay for such services.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, former President, Corporate Fleet Owners and member of COMTUA, Mrs. Folake George alleged that both officials of NPA and AP Moller were frustrating the electronic call-Up system adding that TTP was not fully ready as at the time the call-up system started.\n\nGeorge said: \u201cWe discovered that APMT was sabotaging the staff of the NPA on the road when ETO started.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Operation Whirlstroke Military Outfit forced assailants to withdraw \u2014Oche\n\n\u2026Attack is barbaric \u2014Ebonyi Commissioner\n\nBy Peter Okutu\n\nTHE attack carried out by suspected herdsmen in the boundary area of Ebonyi/Benue last Sunday affected seven vilages of Ndigwe, Ataloga, Odokem, Ekile, Nduobasi,, Ekpufu and Obakota, Vanguard can authoritatively report.\n\nThe attack led to the death of over 30 indigenes of Ebonyi while some survivors are still receiving treatment at the Alex-Ekweme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki.\n\nIn a statement, the Executive Chairman of Ado Local Government Area of Benue State, Chief James Oche said \u201cOperation Whirlstroke Military Outfit after we reached out to them, helped salvage the ensuing massacre by repelling the attacks and forcing the assailants to withdraw.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Statement: \u201cIn the early hours of Sunday, May 30, 2021, herdsmen in their numbers concomitantly attacked several Igbo speaking communities of Ado Local Government Area of Benue State. They unleashed an unprecedented degree of terror, killing no fewer than 30 persons as at the time of this release.\n\n\u201cThe communities worst hit by the attack are; Ndigwe village, Ataloga village, Odokem, Ekile village, Nduobasi village, Ekpufu and Obakota villages. The residents of these villages have been completely displaced. While others have lost their lives, many are yet to be found and have remained missing.\n\n\u201cIt was the response of the Operation Whirlstroke Military Outfit after we reached out to them that helped salvage the ensuing massacre by repelling the attacks and forcing the assailants to withdraw.\n\n\u201cWe condemn in strong terms this attack and wish to say that it is one too many an onslaught on our people and the devastation suffered is better imagined. We have a fresh situation of about 3000 internally displaced persons caused by this attack in addition to the 2000 we had from previous attacks.\n\n\u201cWhile there are insinuations from unsubstantiated sources that the attack was a reprisal for IPOB\u2019s alleged murder of a herdsman, we categorically state with emphasis that, Benue State is not and can never be party to IPOB agitation and attacking our people on IPOB related issues is a thing we will not accept.\n\n\u201cIn view of the ensuing murder of our people by these herdsmen, we urge our people to rise up and take all steps as may be necessary to give self defence to themselves, as it would be cowardly to remain arms-folded and be murdered right in our homes.\n\n\u201cWe further appreciate and pledge our loyalty to the government of Benue State. The Anti-Open Grazing and Ranches Establishment Law of our state stands and we are committed to its enforcement no matter what. We call on the federal government to live up to its responsibility of protecting the lives and property of Nigerians, as the growing insecurity is fast turning the country into the Hobbean state of nature.\n\n\u201cWe urge our people not to be discouraged, but to rise up to the task in defence of our fatherland, as we will continue to support in the best way, time and resources would afford us. \u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nCarrying out an on the spot assessment of the attack on Izzi Community in Benue State, Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi, Commissioner for Capital City Development, Ebonyi State, described the attack as barbaric and savage and enjoined the people to remain calm but vigilant.\n\nHe described as worrisome, the incessant attacks on unarmed and defenceless citizens by marauding herdsmen while the federal government keeps aloof. He stated that Ebonyi State government under Governor David Umahi is leaving no stone unturned in making sure that the lives and property of residents of the state are protected.\n\nHe further decried the lackadaisical attitude of the Benue State government and wondered why the Benue State government could not show any concern or action when the people they claim are their own are being massacred and their property destroyed wantonly, even after the carnage.\n\nHe stated that the incident has clearly shown that Benue State does not accept the people of the area either ethnically or geographically. He said there is a question to answer on why the people of Ado and Oju LGAs of Benue State could allow the attackers free access to attack Izzi people and leave after the incident without any hindrance. The whole thing, he said, smacks of something fishy.\n\nHe however commended the Ebonyi State governor for his quick response and immediate dispatch of relief materials to the affected community.\n\nHe said the fact that the Governor of Ebonyi State took prompt response and responsibility of the medical treatment of those injured in the attack showed that he recognizes the people as Ebonyians, which they truly are.\n\nOther well-meaning Ebonyi stakeholders such as the Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Francis Nwifuru and the Chairman of Ebonyi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Mrs. Chinyere Nwoagbaga have reached out to the victims of the Sunday attack.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

In these states, the directive was actively observed.\n\nAsari Dakubo has been challenging Kanu for the control of the movement.

          "text": "Residents and indigenes of Ushafa community in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, are now having sleepless nights over the constant harassment by some land grabbers who have come under the guise of Dam safety to displace residents and indigenes.\n\nThe residents who have been under the threat of demolition following the claim of encroachment by FCT Water Board have lamented the constant intimidation, harassment and threats they get every day from the Water Board and its alleged sponsors, aimed at displacing them.\n\nUshafa is one of the most recognized villages in the FCT, and it\u2019s popularly called \u2018Clinton village\u2019 as the then United States President, Bill Clinton visited the village during his tour of the country. Gbagi indigenes settle in the area.\n\nBut the residents have constantly been threatened by estate developers and land grabbers who always claim they are working with the FCT Water Board to harass indigenes.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that recently, the Water Board and some of the suspected estate developers brought Development Control and FCDA to the area, claiming that the entire Ushafa is the catchment area of the dam, terming all activities around the dam as illegal.\n\nThey had claimed at least 500 meters away from the dam as their catchment area. But community members came out en mass, challenging the claim of the Water Board and other stakeholders allegedly working for some developers. The indigenes had alleged that there was no agreement with the Water Board or any other government agency that it was going to relinquish its entire land to site a dam. A resident had said at a stakeholders meeting that \u201cOur fathers were cajoled into giving up their lands for the dam without due compensation. After giving you the portion to site the dam, we have the right to live. We must continue to survive, build our houses on the remaining part of the dam, farm and continue our fishery activities. Stopping us from these remains the highest level of injustice,\u201d the resident said.\n\nOur reporter who monitored proceedings during a town hall meeting held at the Water Board and attended by various stakeholders in the FCT, observed the anger of the indigenes who have insisted that they cannot be chased out of their fatherland.\n\nOne of the Indigenes said, \u201d You can\u2019t chase us out of our land. What for? Do you want to chase us from our land because of the water we don\u2019t enjoy? Is the water more than my being alive as a person? So Gbagi indigenes should always take the blow? It won\u2019t happen this time around.\u201d\n\nWhen DAILY POST contacted the Chief\u2019s Palace for clarification, our reporter was told by the palace that Water Board was reneging on the agreement they had with them years past. The palace, however, refused to speak further on the matter, stating that a committee is currently looking into the Ushafa\u2019s matter.\n\nBut another resident who spoke to DAILY POST but pleaded anonymity accused the Water Board of grabbing the entire Ushafa land to either share among themselves or to top people in government to develop. \u201d He said, this is clearly for business. This is not part of what we agreed with them. How can they take lands people have built on and have been living for over 35 years? Where have they been all these years? Why the sudden interest in Ushafa? Where do they want us to run to? \u201d\n\nAnother indigene dismissed the claim by the Water Board that the FCT Minister was behind the ordeal of the people. While pleading anonymous, he said, \u201cThe Minister that I know cannot order that people\u2019s houses be pulled down, knowing the amount of investment here and considering the current economic reality and security challenges. No. I don\u2019t believe those people are working for the Minister.\u201d\n\nBut a minute of the meeting held at the Water Board obtained by DAILY POST revealed that FCT Water Board is pushing for the demolition of houses and eviction of landowners from their community due to alleged illegal activities of farmers and landowners that pose danger to dam safety.\n\nOur reporter, however, observed when he visited the Dam gate that some local security men were employed by the same community to protect the dam. A source at Water Board corroborated this, stating that Water Board is fully aware of the said effort by the community. One of the private security officers told our reporter that he was under the payroll of the community to protect the dam from any form of illegality, especially suspicious movements within the area that could be a threat to the entire FCT. He said, \u201cthe community pays me. We protect the area against criminal activities. We stop illegal dumping of refuse around the area and anyone trying to build at the restricted area.\u201d\n\nLamenting, a Gbagi Indigene, Mr Sam said, \u201d They want to chase us away from our land because of the water we don\u2019t drink? Usbafa people don\u2019t have water. We all dig boreholes.\u201d\n\nDAILY POST findings reveal that over 15,000 people will be displaced should any form of demolition occur in the area. Our correspondent observed that houses within the area are well structured with a standard layout. It was further gathered that most of the indigenes are either business people or civil servants who while planning for retirement decided to build at the place they could call their home.\n\nOn the claim of proximity to the dam and the safety of residents, DAILY POST further observed that the area occupied by the indigenes is the upper part of the dam. It was observed that the dam flows downwards and not upwards. Just 250 meters away from the dam is DSS institute, SCC Construction company and a quarter belonging to FCT Water Board staff. Also around the dam area are plots allocated by the government.\n\nA source from the Ministry of Water Resources foreclosed the possibility of the dam overflowing, as it\u2019s not even able to serve water to the entire FCT residents in a year. He said, \u201d This is why we get supply from Gurara. Anyone saying the dam could overflow is a big liar. They should still give another reason. Besides, if the dam poses any threat, it is to those living at its exit way, not people who are living in Ushafa. It would rather affect people in Kubwa or Dutse.\u201d\n\nA security report seen by DAILY POST as forwarded to the FCT Police Command had warned against any form of demolition owing to its security implications. DAILY POST could not obtain a copy.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that series of meetings have been held with stakeholders on how the issue can be amicably resolved. The community had on different occasions engaged traditional rulers in the FCT, the Area Council and other important stakeholders on the matter.\n\nA source told DAILY POST that the FCT Minister is concerned about the lives of residents of Ushafa and is interested in placing premium on their wellbeing, hence reviewing critically the initial proposal sent to his desk by some contractors interested in the area.\n\nDAILY POST finding revealed that one of the companies interested in Ushafa area is Jigna Eco-Ranch Limited. The company had written to the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, on April 26, 2021, seeking partnership on the development of the Dam area.\n\nOn DAILY POST\u2019s second visit to the Dam area, our correspondent observed that Water Board had demarcated the body of the dam from the area. Also visibly erected by a major road separating the community from the Dam is a notice that reads \u201cRestricted Area\u201d.\n\nA resident told our reporter upon enquiry that the restricted notice and the barb wired-fence show that it is only when one goes beyond the area that the offence of encroachment can say to have been committed.\n\nAlso under the firm grab of Water Board are lands at different locations in Ushafa including a contentious one opposite the Jordan FM called Dutse Bmapma plot. Only last week, Development Control pulled down dwarf fences erected on the said plots by the owners under the directive of Water Board.\n\nWhen DAILY POST contacted the Acting General Manager of Water Board, Dame Joy Okoro, she said, \u201cas far as I know, I do not know about any attempt to grab land. Our dispute with the people of the village is an encroachment on the waterway (downstream). We have given them notice not to encroach. We have not asked the entire village to leave, rather stop all erection and demolition order has been issued on houses built on the waterway.\u201d\n\nBut most of the residents interviewed refuted Ms Joy\u2019s claim, saying that no demolition notice had been issued to them and that an inter-ministerial committee is still looking into the claims by Water Board. They also debunked the claim that houses were built on the waterway as there is no waterway in Ushafa.",
          "summary": "But the residents have constantly been threatened by estate developers and land grabbers who always claim they are working with the FCT Water Board to harass indigenes.\nBut community members came out en mass, challenging the claim of the Water Board and other stakeholders allegedly working for some developers.\nA source at Water Board corroborated this, stating that Water Board is fully aware of the said effort by the community.\nJust 250 meters away from the dam is DSS institute, SCC Construction company and a quarter belonging to FCT Water Board staff.\nOnly last week, Development Control pulled down dwarf fences erected on the said plots by the owners under the directive of Water Board.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nA grand design to boost Nigeria\u2019s internal security and revenue has made the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) to beam its searchlight on private jet owners, who are now mandated to carry out an immediate verification of their aircraft to ensure they are operating legally as enshrined in the Federal Government\u2019s extant laws.\n\nNCS Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, during a press briefing in Abuja, yesterday, said defaulters will be visited with the full weight of the law, saying no one will be treated as a sacred cow.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn line with the need to ensure strict compliance with all regulations, especially at this time of challenging security situation and reluctance of some highly placed individuals to pay taxes, NCS will be taking stock of all privately-owned aircraft in the country. This is to ensure strict compliance with all relevant regulations governing importation of such aircraft.\n\n\u201cConsequently, NCS, in line with its statutory functions as provided for in Part III Sections 27, 35, 37, 45, 46, 47, 52, 56, 63 & 64; Part XI Sections 144, 145, 155, 160, 161 & 164 and Part XII Sections 167, 168, 169 173 & 174 of the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA), hereby invites owners of private aircraft in the country to come forward with their relevant importation clearance documents for verification.\u201d\n\nAttah said the documents sought for verification are: aircraft certificate of registration, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s (NCAA) Flight Operations Compliance Certificate, NCAA\u2019s Maintenance Compliance Certificate, NCAA\u2019s Permit for Non-Commercial Flights and Temporary Import Permit (where application).\n\nHe noted that all private jet owners or their representatives are to report to room 305, Tariff and Trade Department, NCS Headquarters, Abuja from Monday, June 7 through Tuesday, July 6, 2021 between 10:00am and 5:00pm daily, with relevant aircraft documents for verification.\n\nWhile clarifying that private jets do not pay Customs duties, Attah said such airplanes are expected to pay the mandatory Comprehensive Imports Supervision Scheme (CISS) charges.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure all charges due to the government are paid. The move is not punitive but to ensure compliance. If deficiencies are found, there will be room for correction.\n\n\u201cWe are aware Nigeria is facing security challenges and there is a downturn in global economy and so any legitimate thing that will boost our revenue is welcome.\n\n\u201cWe need to know who owns what and we want to know how they came in to ensure nothing untoward happened,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the likely sanctions defaulters might face, Attah said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to jump the gun on sanctions. But it depends on the gravity of the offence. We are not in a position to pre-empt anything. We believe private jet owners are highly-placed individuals that will do the right thing. They\u2019ll will do what the law says.\u201d\n\nIn another development, Attah disclosed Customs generated N799,024,705,961 between January 1 and May 30 this year.\n\nThe Customs spokesman described the figure as glaring improvement on N226,110,610,991 generated within the same period in 2020.\n\nHe said the feat was made possible due to strict implementation of all extant rules governing imports, exports and excise in Nigeria, strategic deployment of officers, automation of the processes and regulations, increasing inclination of officers and men to put national interest above selves, robust stakeholders\u2019 sensitisation, increasing level of compliance from stakeholders and improved working relation with National Assembly.\n\nAttah disclosed those who passed the aptitude test of the ongoing recruitment exercise have been invited for physical screening.\n\n\u201cWe are now ensuring we sieve out the issues like health, height and others, and soon, the final list will be out. Then, they\u2019ll come for documentation and later proceed for training,\u201d he said.",

There were also no human and vehicular movements within Abakaliki, the capital city.\n\nAn official of one of the banks at Awka, who sought not to be named, said in an interview with THISDAY that \u201cI am not in the office. The bank will not work for today. Who do you want to go to bank so that these people will come and kill them? I am at home. There is no movement and so who will you attend to?\u201d\n\nHowever, some people who defied the directive and went out in the early hours of yesterday returned home with injuries and their belongings destroyed.\n\nAll the streets were also deserted with heavy presence of security agencies and operatives of Ebubeagu at some designated junctions.\n\nViolence, resulting in sporadic gunshots and destruction of property, were witnessed in some parts of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe sporadic gun duel between the police and the agitators within Ebebe junction in Abakaliki capital city reportedly claimed five lives.\n\nWhile the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Aliyu Garba, confirmed that some of the suspected agitators were arrested, there was no official report on the alleged death of a policeman and four IPOB members.\n\nHowever, a source at the Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, said the police brought in about four corpses to the morgue.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some of the agitators divided themselves into groups and laid ambush in a forest along Ogbaga Road, where they intercepted anyone who flouted the directive on sit-at-home. They were said to have beaten up the violators and set their belongings ablaze.\n\nAn eyewitness said that many motorcycles were burnt while their riders fled with injuries.\n\nA student of Ebonyi State University also told THISDAY that the sit-at-home order disrupted academic activities.\n\nAnother school proprietor had also notified to parents and guardians earlier that the school would not open today.\n\nEmpty streets, deserted roads, closed shops and business premises characterised the observance of the Biafra Day in Umuahia, the Abia State capital and Aba, the commercial nerve centre of the state.\n\nResidents of the two major Abia cities fully complied with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe city centre of Umuahia was devoid of its usual bustling commercial activities as people remained in indoors.\n\nCommercial transporters also withdrew their vehicles, while private vehicles deserted the roads.\n\nGovernment institutions were also affected by the sit-at-home directive as schools and government offices did not open.\n\nBanks and other corporate businesses equally shut their gates.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, there was no presence of the police and other security agencies patrolling the streets in Umuahia.\n\nThe separatist agitators also comported themselves peacefully while marking the Biafra Day as there was no street parade, which usually attracted heavy response from security agencies as happened on previous occasions.\n\nKanu had while giving directives on the observance of this year\u2019s Biafra Day strictly warned against any street protest, saying that people should stay indoors and mourn the fallen heroes.\n\nThe order also recorded total compliance in Enugu State.\n\nAs early as 8am yesterday, major markets within the Enugu metropolis, including Abakpa, New Haven, Garki, and Holy Ghost were shut.\n\nMarkets in Nsukka areas were also empty.\n\nMotor parks and other commercial places were equally deserted.\n\nStreets that were usually filled with people were empty even as there were no vehicular movements.\n\nPolice patrol vans were seen around Okpara Avenue, adjacent to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) office, Enugu.\n\nThe Enugu State Police Command had on Sunday, urged the residents of the state to disregard the order, warning that anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions would be dealt with.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists by the Police Public Relations Officer, Enugu State Command, Daniel Ndukwe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, had enjoined residents of the state to remain law-abiding, vigilant, as they went about their legitimate businesses.\n\nThe order also recorded 100 per cent compliance in Imo State.\n\nPrevious directives to mark the declaration of Biafra did not record the level of compliance observed in the state yesterday.\n\nAnalysts, however, attributed the total compliance this year to the heightened insecurity in the state.\n\nThe murder of a top chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and former political adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Hon. Ahmed Gulak, on Sunday morning had heightened the fears of Imo residents and forced them to stay indoors.\n\nAll the major streets in the state capital and every entry and exit points to and from the state were empty as motorists and travellers avoided passing through the state. The ever-busy Wetheral Road, Douglas Road, Royce Road, Okigwe Road, Orlu Road, Onitsha Road, Port Harcourt Road and Aba Road were all empty.\n\nHowever, security agents were alleged to have used the occasion of sit-at-home order to raid some of the hostels and lodges of students of Imo State University, Owerri (IMSU) to arrest some of them.\n\nA tweet from one of the student leaders had alerted the public to the arrest.\n\nEfforts to speak with the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, a Superintendent of Police, proved abortive as he did not answer calls placed to his phone.\n\nShedding light on why there was total compliance with the sit-at-home order, spokesman of the pan-Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Hon. Alex Ogbonnia, told THISDAY from his residence in Enugu that every Igbo person felt the sense of injustice against the Igbo in Nigeria and was a willing participant in the sit-at-home protest to register their displeasure.\n\nHe said: \u201cEven the governors of the South-east states know what is happening. It is a simple way of showing that the marginalisation of the Igbo is becoming unbearable. We are hoping the presidency will address some of these concerns. If for instance, an Igbo man is announced as the Inspector General of Police or Chief of Army Staff, the people will jubilate. If there is a consensus to cede the presidency to the South-east in 2023, all these agitations will die naturally. You can\u2019t continue to oppress a people who are very hardworking and contribute so much to the development of the country and expect them to celebrate their subjugation.\u201d\n\nAlso, President of Igbo Youth Movement, Mr. Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, said the refusal of the federal government to discuss with the agitators had strengthened their resolve to press home their demands.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe strange policy to only shoot and destroy the agitators without ever inviting them to present their position has convinced the people of this region that they are in a hostile political jail. The world over and all through history when between 5,000 and 10,000 people agitate about a situation the government of the land invites them to present their grievance. Nigeria is the only country where hundreds of thousands of people have been protesting over a particular situation in the last 21 years and the government continues to refuse to listen to them. Instead, thousands of them have been killed in cold blood.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Say dialogue, restructuring only ways to address Nigeria\u2019s challenges\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe leadership of major socio-cultural groups from Southern and Middle Belt part of Nigeria yesterday charted a new path for the emergence of a new constitution for Nigeria.\n\nTheir proposals, made at a dialogue session christened, \u2018The \u2018Nigeria\u2019s 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-ethnic Peace Dialogue,\u2019 in Abuja, came against the backdrop of the ongoing constitution review process being carried out by the National Assembly through public hearings in all the six geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nThe groups adopted a common position urging for an emergency national conference to birth a new constitution and pave the way for the restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nThe socio-cultural groups, comprising Afenifere (South-west), Ohanaeze (South-east), Middle Belt and Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), said it was possible to reverse the current challenges facing Nigeria if the federal government could implement their recommendations.\n\nConvener of the summit, Kennedy Iyere, said Nigeria might not make reasonable progress in 2023 if no genuine dialogue was held to address contentious issues.\n\nLeader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, while presenting the position of the Yoruba, which was also adopted by both the Ohanaeze and Middle Belt Forum, said the process for a genuine consensus on an acceptable national constitution should henceforth begin with the production of position documents by all nationalities between now and December.\n\nHe stated that going forward, Nigerians should be allowed to exercise their mandate and sovereignty on how they want to live together under mutually beneficial terms.\n\nHe added that the various regions in the country should be allowed to choose the type of government they want to adopt within their area, under a truly federal structure, which will guarantee some measure of autonomy and control over resources and policing of their entities.\n\nAccording to him, there should be no artificially prescribed number of regions in a manner that may foreclose the rights of the people that desire to organise themselves as a semi- autonomous regional member of the Nigerian state so long as the territory desiring such regional status can guarantee its self-sustenance and viability as an entity.\n\nAdebanjo said: \u201cFlowing from the above, something like the United Regions of Nigeria (URN) is hereby proposed.\n\n\u201cIn this proposal, powers, mandate and authority to formulate the articles of association to form the Central Government of Nigeria shall in effect lie jointly and severally with the ethnic nationalities occupying their respective territories and not with lawmakers who were randomly picked.\n\n\u201cNigeria shall be subsequently organised into a union or federation of voluntarily associating and cooperative regional entities like we had up till 1966. Unlike what we have presently, each region may have a constitution of its own which would spell out how it is to be governed.\n\n\u201cThere would be a national constitution binding all the regions in the country together. In this latter, constitution would spelt out mutually agreed terms under which the peoples of the country agree to cohabit together as citizens of the same country.\u201d\n\nHe added that the proposal should serve as a template to encourage other ethnic nationalities to organise themselves and prepare terms that would guide their relationship with each other in the country in a harmonious and mutually respecting manner.\n\n\u201cFrom such collation of terms would emerge regional constitutions out of which National Constitution would be forged. The constitution, be it at regional or national level, must accord unqualified respect to democratic norms and the rights of the people to actively participate in matters that have to do with their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nAdebanjo added that the constitution must also emphasise true federalism in such a way that no region or area would have power to lord it over another region or area.\n\nAmong the expected contents of the envisaged regional constitutions as envisaged by Afenifere are unreserved powers of the regions over natural resources in their respective areas, like agriculture, education, health, electricity, security and economy.\n\nHe also proposed that each region should contribute 10 per cent of what it generates to the national purse, while retaining 30 per cent; with the states taking 35 per cent and the local governments taking 25 per cent.\n\nAdebanjo said in order to ensure that the proposal would not be abandoned like other reports that have come from various panels or assemblages constituted by governments, timeline would be suggested to guide the process.\n\nAccording to him, under the proposal, ethnic nationalities should be encouraged to prepare their document on terms of engagement between now and December 2021.\n\n\u201cThe documents from the nationalities in which they propose the kind of regional government they want to form be collated and considered between January and March 2022.\n\n\u201cThe product of this process should then produce the document that will become the Constitution of the United Regions of Nigeria or Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA national referendum can be conducted on the adoption of the final Constitution for the Restructured Nigeria around the middle of 2022. The said constitution can then become effective from October 01, 2022.\n\n\u201cA committee can be set up to work out the details of the proposal hereby suggested. We are ready to present the details as we conceive it to the said committee if formed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Afenifere leader also described as erroneous attempts to equate agitations for self-determination by groups in the South with secession. He said issue of true federalism must be central in every constitution or article of engagement for the federating units.\n\nHe added that the concept of true federalism that is acceptable to Afenifere is that which emphasises self-determination.\n\nOn its part, Ohanaeze said while it endorsed the proposals by Afenifere, there should be an emergency national conference to consider the proposals of various ethnic groups and also to review the reports of previous national conferences so as to come up with a new constitution accepted by all.\n\nFormer Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, who made the presentation on behalf of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide President General, Ambassador George Obiozor, said the genesis of the problem being witnessed in the country started when the military took over power in 1966 and removed the federal constitution that would have guided the country to a viable economic and political entity.\n\nEarlier, Obiozor who spoke briefly before leaving the meeting for another engagement, warned that no one should be under any illusion that he could pocket the rest of the country and dictate what they should do.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ghali Umar Na\u2019Abba, urged Nigerians to focus on issues that promote national unity, adding that \u201cany region that decided to pull out of Nigeria will not leave the way they think it is going to be.\u201d\n\nHowever, tension was raised when the leader of the Northern Consensus Initiative, Dr. Awal Abdullahi, said that the North was no longer opposed to a breakup of the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe North before now was saying we don\u2019t believe in separation, but as I\u2019m standing, I\u2019m telling you that if there is going to be separation tomorrow, the North is ready for it; we are also ready. Let\u2019s go our different ways and I am telling you this with all sincerity. Northern Nigeria before now did not want to hear anything separation but as at today, as I speak to you, the North is equally ready.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying might be controversial, but I am speaking the mind of Northerners and I have no apology to anyone in this hall, although I respect the leaders and elders here but I have no apology to anybody on what I say.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Leader of the Middle Belt Forum, Mr. Pogu Bitrus, countered Abdullahi\u2019s position, saying that the Middle Belt will not pull out of the country with the core North.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo if my brother says the North is going, be sure the Middle-Belt is not going with you; you are on your own. We have served and sacrificed for this country. The war that occurred, the Middle-Belt was used to fight while the North sat back to enjoy.\u201d\n\nBitrus stated that the Middle Belt has adopted the proposal of Afenifere and Ohanaeze as a common position on ways to rescue the country.\n\nHe added that the 2023 general election can only hold if the government enacts electoral law approving electronic voting.\n\nHe said the region also supported the restructuring of the country.\n\nPresident of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Mr. Jonathan Asake, also supported the call for a national dialogue to fashion out a new constitution that will guarantee equity and fairness to all nationalities in the country.\n\nAlso, another group, the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace (IDPF), met yesterday in Abuja and canvassed a national dialogue to address the challenges facing Nigeria.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 jointly signed by the Co-chairmen of IDPF, Mr. Kunle Sanni Ishaq and Bishop Sunday Onuoha, the religious leaders said: \u201cWe are using this medium to appeal to the Nigerian governments to do the needful by organising a national dialogue so as to provide a forum for holistic suggestions and recommendations that will bring about the new Nigeria that will address the yearnings and aspirations of the citizens, as well as ensuring public safety and protection.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u202280 winners get award certificates\n\n\u2022NNPC eyes stakes in five more private refineries\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) yesterday concluded the 2020 marginal oilfield bid round, the first successful bid since 2003 when 24 assets were put on offer.\n\nThe process, which culminated in the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator, started in June last year, with 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore put up for lease by the federal government.\n\nThis came just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday unfolded plans to acquire shares in five more private refineries in Nigeria, bringing to six its interests in refineries it is targeting.\n\nHowever, during the bid round, the DPR stated that 161 successful companies were shortlisted to advance to the final stage. Those shortlisted were selected from 591 entities that applied for pre-qualification.\n\nMarginal fields are smaller oil blocks typically developed by indigenous companies and have remained unproduced for a period of over 10 years.\n\nSome of the companies, which emerged winners included: Matrix Energy, AA Rano, Andova Plc, Duport Midstream, Genesis Technical, Twin Summit, Bono Energy, Deep Offshore Integrated, Oodua Oil, MRS and Petrogas.\n\nOthers are: North Oils and Gas, Pierport, Metropole, Pioneer Global, Shepherd Hill, Akata, NIPCO, Aida, YY Connect, Accord Oil, Pathway Oil, Tempo Oil and Virgin Forest, among others.\n\nIt was a big win for local oil and gas companies, which had a good outing during the ceremony as 100 per cent of the beneficiaries of the exercise were indigenous entities.\n\nNigeria last conducted marginal field bid rounds in 2003, with 16 of the fields now contributing just two per cent to the national oil and gas reserves, a figure the DPR said would be substantially boosted by the latest exercise, worth about $500 million in signature bonuses.\n\nAt the presentation of letters to the winners, DPR Director, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, stated that a total of 591 firms submitted expression of interest forms, out of which 540 were pre-qualified, while 482 were bids submitted by 405 applicants.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the end, 161 companies were shortlisted as potential awardees, out of which 50 per cent has met all conditions and therefore eligible for awards today. We are set to ensure opportunities are extended to other deserving applicants to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cThe DPR is not just a regulator, we are an opportunity house. We drive creativity and transformation and we use these in all of our activities. This is done in the overriding national interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bid will enhance economic growth, increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and create employment, while with the experience garnered before now, mistakes of the past will be avoided.\n\nHe said that the desire of the government was for the awardees to hit \u201cfirst oil\u201d in record time, adding that a technical workshop will be organised with all bid winners for guidance on field development and operations.\n\nHe pledged to support the bid winners to operate within the country\u2019s oil and gas space, urging them to take advantage of the oil and gas centre recently inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cDespite the daunting challenges of the triple force (oil price crash, global pandemic and production cuts) in 2020, which dealt a severe blow on the world market and global economy, the DPR forged ahead with government aspirations for the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the exercise was carried out in two phases, expression of interest and prequalification, as well as technical and financial phase.\n\nHe said the phase one ensured that applicants were subjected to screening of basic documentations such as shareholders\u2019 details, directors, management team, procedures and systems, legal and association status, basic technical capability, financial capability and corporate accountability.\n\nAuwalu stated that the DPR has now provided opportunities through the marginal field bid round to indigenous operators for wealth creation and economic growth consistent with government\u2019s drive for increased GDP, employment generation and improved revenue.\n\n\u201cThe DPR will continue to follow up and guide the awardees every step of the way. For instance, a guiding template of working agreement has been drafted for joint awardees and discussions have reached advanced stage between DPR and lease holders on the Farmout agreement and other technical enablers,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Head, Basinal Assessment and Lease Administration (BALA) of the organisation, Mr. Edu Inyang, said when the exercise was being embarked upon, the objectives were to increase indigenous participation in the oil and gas industry, increase reserves, rev up technological transfer, attract investment and enhance revenue generation.\n\nHe stated that a large part of the objectives had been achieved, with the culmination of the process in the presentation of letters.\n\nAssistant Director, DPR, Mr. Abel Nsa, in his remarks, said with the revocation of 11 licences, Nigeria was losing a lot of revenue, with taxes and royalties not being paid on the assets, leaving about 40 million barrels unproduced and many opportunities missed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The state also records instances of farmer-herdsmen conflict and carry a distinct possibility of sudden violent outbreaks,\u201d the report added.\n\nIn Kwara, it identified civil unrest as a major threat factor in the state, fuelled by clashes between commercial drivers and government forces, communal clashes and ethno-religious skirmishes within the metropolis.\n\nHowever, in Lagos, which scored highest in terms of general security, the company stated that high road usage and poor travel conditions result in an increased risk of road traffic accidents within the state.\n\n\u201cCult and gang activities also threaten business travel within the state, especially in communities under Ikorodu and Badagry LGAs. Additional layers of security are advised to maintain personal safety in some areas,\u201d it added.\n\nIn Niger, insurgency and kidnapping were listed as major threat factors, while in Ogun, repeated attacks by rogue herdsmen on farming settlements in Odogbolu, and Imeko-Afon LGAs increase travel risk along that axis.\n\nIt is the same for Ondo, where clashes between herders and farmers are also prevalent in the state, while Osun State faces heightened risk of gunmen attack and cult and gang activities have a free reign.\n\nIt said that Plateau State carried a high kidnap risk, especially along expressways with reduced government security forces visibility as well as record of farmer-herdsmen conflict.\n\nGunmen attacks are a threat for business travellers in Rivers State, according to the report, as cult and gang activities are another major threat for business travellers within the state.\n\nTaraba State faces attacks by rogue herdsmen in Wukari and Karim Lamido , especially, the PR24 report said.\n\n\u201cTakum and Jalingo LGAs also carry increased threat ratings at this time, due to reported incidents of bandit attacks on the citizenry and security forces posted in the area,\u201d the advisory added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Human rights activists have described the attack on the publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, as an attack on the rule of law, capable of truncating democracy in the country.\n\nThey said it appeared that the country is now in full-blown anarchy since Nigerians can no longer exercise their constitutional rights.\n\nThey disclosed this in separate interviews with SaharaReporters in Abuja on Monday during a solidarity visit to Sowore.\n\nNigerians Condemn Shooting Of Human Rights Activist, @YeleSowore By Policemen During Protest Against Insecurity In Abuja | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/d1ZgRXDXTZ pic.twitter.com/hLTJZLWlzP \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) May 31, 2021\n\nA former Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ), Chidi Odinkalu, said the brutal attack on the unarmed protesters by the police had further moved the country from tyranny to anarchy.\n\nHe said there was a need to rescue the country from total collapse, adding that President Muhammadu was helpless and had run out of ideas in putting the country on the path of honour.\n\nOdinkalu said, \"I hope the police and federal authority can investigate properly and we get to the bottom of the matter because I don't think it is enough to complain and go away.\n\n\"The country is sliding into anarchy. I think we are probably beyond tyranny now because President Muhammadu is short of ideas. He doesn't know what to do, and he is not interested. The country is sliding into anarchy; everywhere you go, you can see. Nigeria is in danger.\"\n\nOn his part, the Coordinator Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, expressed worry at how the Buhari government clamped down on the dissenting voices.\n\nAdeyanju said, \"Unity fountain is now under lock and key. They have taken over the place.\n\n\"Government now determines who goes in and who goes out. If it is pro-government protesters, they will be protected as if they are a national asset, but if it is anti-government like what we witnessed today, you see how they were treated like criminals and terrorist group.\n\n\"This is the same government that negotiated with terrorists, met bandits and pay ransom.\n\n\"If you look at what happened during #ENDSARS, protesters were shot at and look at what happened to Omoyele Sowore today in broad daylight. He was shot at Unity Fountain.\"\n\nSee Also Breaking News BREAKING: Police Shoot Sowore During Protest Rally In Abuja, Rushed To The Hospital\n\nA human rights activist, Martins Onobo, stressed that every Nigerians has the right to protest and assembly, adding that any attempt to stop them from exercising such rights is illegal.\n\nOnobo said, \"What has happened was like targeting the key voices in the society to induce fear in the system to prevent other activists from coming out to say something. This is a blow to democracy and the rule of law.\n\n\"The law is clear that everybody has fundamental rights to protest and assemble. People can no longer talk; they can no longer assemble. Don't let anyone deceive you that the country is sliding into anarchy.\n\n\" We are already in anarchy, and don't let anyone deceive you that the media and civic space is shrinking; it is closed. More people are afraid of coming out to protest, speak and engage. If they could shoot him in daylight, then who is safe?\"",

          "text": "Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa, has raised $6.5m in a Series B round led by Partech from its Africa Fund.\n\nThe startup was founded in 2016 when Ihad Fikry and Ibrahim Kamel decided there was a need to cater to the learning needs in the MENA region that were not provided by other platforms.\n\n\u201cWe live in a region with a population of 400 million-plus people but 90% of them cannot learn properly in any other language but Arabic,\u201d Ihab Fikry, Almentor\u2019s co-founder and CEO, says to TechCabal.\n\nThe courses are designed to provide knowledge \u201cin a proper manner without promoting any ideology or religious thoughts,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHow Almentor works\n\nFrom gamified mobile apps to websites that enable streaming, online learning comes in different varieties across the world.\n\nHundreds of educational channels like TED-Ed, Khan Academy and Crash Course have carved a niche on YouTube, without having to build their own technologies. Where does Almentor fit in this universe?\n\nAlmentor can be accessed in multiple countries across Africa but the content is focused on North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nFikry describes Almentor as sharing the attributes of renowned platforms like Masterclass, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.\n\nIt charges users a subscription to access its library of 12,000 videos.\n\nThe platform has a video-on-demand component that enables learners to stream content, while a learning management system engages users in classroom-like activities like asking and answering questions, and taking exams.\n\nAlmentor can be accessed anywhere, even in Nigeria, but the focus is to serve the Arabic region.\n\nTheir library includes math, history, natural sciences and training material for corporations. For social sciences where context may vary between countries, creators are selected from various countries to ensure the material is relevant. However, many users can find similarities because virtually every course is available in Arabic.\n\nAlmentor works with subject-matter teachers and professional content creators around the MENA region to create the courses. The company and the creators share revenue from subscriptions based on an agreement on exclusivity and whole ownership of the content by Almentor.\n\nFikry says they have received over 3,000 applications from people who want to create course material on Almentor, but the acceptance rate is currently at 12%. Besides welcoming applications, the startup proactively headhunts already successful lecturers and also engages agencies to recruit mentors for them.\n\nSo far, Almentor has provided 2 million successful learning experiences to users. Fikry explains this metric means the learner has consumed at least 25% of the learning material.\n\nLearning categories vary from basic (30% of their library) to intermediate and advanced levels.\n\nA typical Almentor learner is between ages 18 and 40 years old. 51% of learners are male while 49% are female. 60% are from Egypt, 25% are from Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain. The rest come from Algeria, Morocco, Niger and Arabs living in the US and UK.\n\nIn terms of socioeconomic status, Fikry says Almentor learners are between the middle and upper class.\n\n\u201cFor those in Class A+, they prefer to learn in English though some learn in French. For others, almost 40% can only learn in Arabic,\u201d Fikry, a PhD holder who used to be a management professor and PWC consultant, explains.\n\nSeed to Series B, driven by partnerships\n\nAs much as it is a service targeted as directly serving consumers, a key element of Almentor\u2019s progress has been over 80 partnerships it has entered with organisations and governments.\n\nOne such partnership is with the Ministry of Education in Egypt for a white-label curriculum targeted at 4.5 million students in grades 7 to 9. They have another with the government in the UAE to upskill entrepreneurs in the region.\n\nRegardless of the country or the partnership, Almentor\u2019s promise is that users will \u201clearn from a subject matter expert without being driven to any ideology,\u201d Fikry insists.\n\nIt is a sophisticated commitment that requires a range of management skills, beyond merely setting up technology for streaming and learning. It also needs capital to achieve its potential, Fikry says, which explains why they have sought out investors to continue to build.\n\nAs with having governments on board, working with VCs \u201cgives credibility to the platform as we are serving an area with lots of dynamics,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHe says they particularly sought out Partech for this round owing to the VC\u2019s global spread of portfolio companies spanning fintech, edtech and other sectors.\n\nWith this Series B, Almentor has now raised $14.5 million.\n\nIt opened the funding gates with a $3.5 million seed fund in 2016.

          "text": "Barely seven months after a $30 million funding round in which Jeff Bezos participated, Chipper Cash has raised $100 million in a Series C round.\n\nThe round was led by SVB Capital, a US firm investing in an Africa-focused startup for the first time. Existing Chipper Cash investors like Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions and 500 Startups participated. One Way Ventures, Tribe Capital, and Brue2 Ventures also joined the round.\n\nChipper Cash enables individuals to transfer money at zero fees between African countries. It also offers Chipper Checkout, a paid service for businesses to receive payments by sharing payment links with customers or integrating a button on a website or app.\n\nBefore now, the startup was present in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. But Ham Serunjogi, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch they have now made their services available in the UK.\n\nThis expansion comes on the heels of a 33% increase in users \u2013 from 3 million in November 2020 to 4 million at present. Within this period, the company introduced new features to its app including virtual VISA cards for online shopping in Nigeria and crypto transactions in South Africa and Uganda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nThis Series C marks a stunning rise for a three-year-old startup. It was founded in 2018 by Serunjogi, a Ugandan, and Maijid Moujaled, a Ghanaian. Three years later, the pair has steered the company to the top bracket of fintech startups on the continent, at least in terms of the amount of venture capital raised.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nSince May 2019 when they raised $2.4m, the startup\u2019s total funding stands at $152.2m. Serunjogi, the Chipper Cash CEO, declined to be specific about what the startup is now worth.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not getting into our valuation, but we\u2019re probably the most valuable private startup in Africa today after this round,\u201d he said.\n\nMaijid Moujaled (seated) and Ham Serunjogi, Chipper Cash co-founders\n\nIn March this year, Flutterwave \u2013 a private startup in Africa \u2013 raised $170m and explicitly said they were now valued at more than $1bn. Segunjogi\u2019s comment suggests that Chipper Cash may also now be worth over $1bn, even if they have raised $80m less than the Nigerian fintech.\n\nLike Flutterwave, Chipper Cash is headquartered in San Francisco but has over 200 employees working out of Africa and serving African customers.

Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT Hello, On Tuesday, Stripe announced a feature for merchants to create payment links and sell online without a website. As with many things from Stripe, it sounded unparalleled \u2013 another \u201cgame-changer\u201d in global e-payments. But allow Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s CEO, tell you where the proof of concept came from: \u201c\u2026the thing that\u2019s interesting to me about the payment link \u201cspace\u201d is that it\u2019s a use case that really took off in other markets first \u2014 Nigeria, India, Philippines, etc. I suspect that staying abreast of important new patterns emerging outside US/Europe will become more important for many businesses in the years ahead\u2026\u201d Payments links is one example of how emerging markets can teach developed economies a few tricks for the digital economy. Another space where Nigeria\u2019s example may influence the global space is real-time payments, as we\u2019ll see shortly after a message from our partners. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive in. Exporting e-payments One consequence of last year\u2019s pandemic was a sharp increase in the use of mobile wallets. According to a new report by ACI Worldwide, an American payments system company, mobile wallet adoption increased by 46% in 2020. Growth in 2019 was 40.6% while the mark for 2018 was 18.9%. This trend suggests that payments is becoming: more mobile: through apps available on smartphones, smart watches, etc and less in physical bank branches.\n\nfaster: if people are more confident to make payments online, it must be because both sender and receiver are getting notified of transaction success more quickly too. Indeed, online payments are becoming more real-time around the world. Real-time transaction volumes increased by 41% from 50 billion in 2019 to 70.3 billion in 2020. Transaction value rose by 32.8% from $69 trillion to $92 trillion. So which countries are driving this trend?\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights With 25.5 billion transactions in 2020, India is by far the global leader on real-time payments. China, South Korea, Thailand and the UK make up the top five.\n\nIndia\u2019s real-time payments revolution started in 2016 when the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was launched. They\u2019ve gone on to build an Immediate Payment System. But before all this, Nigeria made a similar historic move with NIBSS Instant Payments (NIP) in 2011.\n\nNIP is a real-time payment solution that guarantees instant value to beneficiaries. NIBSS (Nigeria Interbank Settlement Scheme, a company co-owned by banks in Nigeria) built E-bills Pay on the NIP platform to enable account-to-account payments.\n\nBoth creations have been described as part of the foundations for Nigeria\u2019s fintech boom today. Andrew Levin, the chief economics for PwC in Nigeria once called NIBSS the most impactful fintech in Nigeria. What NIBSS did in 2011, many are still in the process of creating. The US\u2019s first real-time payment network is barely four years old. Instant transfers through that network only became available on PayPal\u2019s Venmo in August 2019. The US Federal Reserve Bank plans to launch FedNow, a NIBSS NIP of sorts, in 2023.\n\nBut as good as NIBSS has been in Nigeria, some fintechs are already looking to go further in making transactions more real-time and unifying payments.\n\nTeamApt, a startup founded in 2015, introduced a \u201cvirtual account\u201d system that has become a standard for instant transfers among Nigerian fintechs. This year, a new startup has come out of beta to provide instant settlement for businesses. It is already being called \u201cNIBSS for fintechs.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Nigeria does not have India or China\u2019s population to top real-time payments lists. Nigerian consumers may not be at the income levels in economies like South Korea and the UK. But as Collison said, the West African country is a place to watch for trends that could shape the future of online payments. FROM THE CABAL Nigeria-based fintech OPay is said to be plotting a $400 million fundraise that will see it valued at $1.5 billion. The money will be deployed to deepend its impressive payments processing operation in Nigeria and expansion elsewhere. There\u2019s that will see it valued at $1.5 billion.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "In 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a directive to banks mandating them to increase the number of loans they give. Consequently, there was an increase in loan requests.\n\nWith technology and the rise of money-lending platforms like Carbon, Branch, FairMoney, and Migo, offering personal collateral-free loans, anyone can borrow money without visiting a bank.\n\nThis means that lenders are more accessible. However, since the onset of the pandemic, they have had a tough time as borrowers haven\u2019t repaid their loans, citing the economic effects of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2020, the CBN activated the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) policy allowing banks to withdraw defaulting loans from any account held by a borrower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile loan collection for BVN-linked bank accounts may be somewhat smooth, the reverse is the case for credit fintech startups.\n\nMoreover, with millions of people demanding personal loans, lending amounts for these platforms become smaller. Also, lenders experience difficulties in collection for small amounts.\n\nThis challenge prompted the three co-founders \u2014 Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Julian Flosbach; Chief Production Officer (CPO), Moses Nmor; and Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chukwudi Enyi \u2014 to come up with BFREE, in August 2020.\n\nThrough its tech-enabled and credit management solution that makes collection processes more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly, BFREE concentrates on helping its customers with their finances.\n\n\u201cLending has experienced a digital revolution, but credit collection needs to be efficient, scalable, and ethical. That\u2019s exactly what we are doing at BFREE,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\nThe team met at FairMoney, where Flosbach was General Manager. Enyi was the Head of Growth at Nairabox, OPay, and FairMoney, while Nmor is a former team member at OPay, Kudi, and FairMoney.\n\nTheir duties at FairMoney were mostly related to managing loan collection. They\u2019d also all spent time at different fast-scaling financial startups where loan collection was a problem.\n\n\u201cAll the co-founders used to work in large digital lending fintech startups in Nigeria, and collections were always a struggle. Hence, we looked at the collection process to come up with a way to reinvent it from scratch to fix these challenges,\u201d Enyi reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile lending has evolved digitally, loan collection is still done traditionally through law firms and smaller collection agencies, with little or no transparency or accountability.\n\nBesides, customers are often threatened with calls, messages, and emails, which Flosbach calls \u201ca no-go for impact-oriented lenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough lenders are specialists and may seem to be focused on lending, they may not be skilled or focused on collections,\u201d Flosbach clarifies.\n\nTherefore, there is a need to specialise in loan collection and lending because the two products are different.\n\n\u201cThe lenders\u2019 tech improves the actual lending product and not collection. All the digital lenders I know look to outsource their collections due to the scalability issue,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nSolving an actual problem\n\nLending platforms unavoidably end up with Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide outsourcing services for large telcos or banks by managing their teleservices and customer services.\n\nSince the BPO companies are not lending professionals, the co-founders aim to help lenders get their money from their customers.\n\nCustomers fail to repay their loans for different reasons. Therefore, a different approach is required to make them pay back.\n\n\u201cNo legit customer takes a loan with the intention to default. However, life does not always go according to plan. In the end, a customer that cannot service a loan is in a financial emergency,\u201d Enyi explains.\n\nTo tackle this, they first identify why the customer defaulted before deploying machine language algorithms. BFREE uses a combination of a self-servicing platform, chat and call bots, and human contact centre operations after identifying how customers can repay.\n\n\u201cHere we deploy machine learning algorithms that predict the probability to repay a customer and define the use case of the customer,\u201d Flosbach submits.\n\nAnd if customers have not been repaying their loans and interests to the lenders, it\u2019s likely BFREE reaches out to them.\n\n\u201cIf a customer has not been servicing a balance from a lender, there is a good chance that we will get in contact with them and offer our product to find a solution that works for the customers and the lender,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nOn the other hand, customers who don\u2019t repay are addressed differently.\n\n\u201cCustomers who don\u2019t repay don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t see the benefits of repaying. Hence, they need financial literacy,\u201d Flosbach adds.\n\nBefore such customers start servicing a loan again, the startup gives them some financial education like understanding the importance of loan repayment and credit score.\n\n\u201cWe try as much to incentivise these customers to cooperate with us. For example, we offer them a discount on their loan repayments. After offering them the incentives, we do our financial literacy classes,\u201d says Flosbach.\n\nMeanwhile, they are currently testing these classes through their self-service platform to see how effective they would be on debt customers.\n\n\u201cWe do not use an app for our self-servicing platform, but a webview, which works like a webpage,\u201d he discloses.\n\nWhile they reach out to the debtors, the co-founders believe that in an ethical credit collection, not everyone would repay.\n\nAt the moment, Flosbach claims there is no other fintech startup offering the same service as BFREE on the continent.\n\n\u201cThere is no similar innovation in Africa in our space of the lending value chain. This part has been overlooked for quite a while, and our competition mainly consists of BPO companies.\u201d\n\nHowever, the team believes that with time, competition for innovation in credit collections in Africa would increase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d welcome this step as it is always better for the end-customers if options are competing for the best customer value,\u201d Flosbach declares.\n\nA sustainable model\n\nOn how BFREE makes money, Flosbach explains, \u201cWe charge a certain percentage commission of the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size, portfolio quality, and likes.\u201d\n\nAnd how sustainable is that?\n\n\u201cIt is sustainable. We have very solid unit economics as our solutions work very well, and we usually achieve at least 30% higher repayments than the BPO companies,\u201d he continues.\n\nThough the credit fintech startup operates a B2B2C model, with currently over 300,000 customers, it has its challenges.\n\n\u201cOne of our challenges is to convince lenders that there is a better way to do collection than how they\u2019ve been doing it,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom Nigeria to Africa\n\nThe Lagos-based credit startup recently raised an $800,000 pre-seed round to build a solution for all emerging markets struggling with infrastructure for collection in Africa. Nigeria-based Beta.Ventures, Launch Africa Ventures, and GreenHouse Capital led the round.\n\n\u201cWe focus all of our product development to assist customers in a state of financial emergency. There are millions of customers in personal debt. This is really what motivates us as a team,\u201d Nmor declares.\n\nThe team is bullish about the Kenyan market they are expanding into.\n\n\u201cWe have a team on the ground already that is setting up our solution as we speak,\u201d Flosbach reveals.\n\nIn the Kenyan market, there have been several cases where BPO companies threatened or publicly shamed customers, something Flosbach considers inappropriate for lenders.\n\nWhile debt consumers may default on a payment due to unforeseen circumstances, the high interest on payment is also a factor.\n\nRecall that in digital predatory lending in Nigeria, we highlighted how the interest rate upon repayment is one reason debt consumers don\u2019t repay promptly.\n\nIn Kenya, where scores of apps offering short-term advances similar to payday loans are common, the interest rate upon repayment is also a problem.\n\nThe credit fintech startup offers a personal budgeting service to debt consumers to help them spend within their means and repay their loans with interest promptly.\n\nThrough its consumer personal budgeting processes, algorithms, and financial literacy, BFREE believes it will tackle Africa\u2019s rising consumer debt.\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Google-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, released an update to its terms of service in November 2020. While it immediately took effect for users in the US, users outside the US will begin to experience the change from June 1, 2021.\n\nThe update revealed that taxes will now be levied on the royalties of content creators resident in the US, who are already entitled to payments on the platform. This will soon take place in other countries as the new terms of service are rolled out.\n\nThe platform revisited its data privacy policy and warned strongly that it would not permit the collection of any information, facial recognition data inclusive, that might be used to identify a user without their permission.\n\nYouTube also emphasised its right to monetise all content on the platform as it announced that ads might appear on channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and the YouTubers who own these channels will not get a revenue cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this means is that as a content creator on YouTube who isn\u2019t a partner on YPP, ads \u2014 which YouTube says you\u2019re not entitled to get payments for \u2014 might now appear during your videos.\n\nThe YPP was launched in December 2007 as a means of revenue generation for creators, who allow ads to appear on their videos for an amount of money. Members of the YPP have to meet certain criteria, including having up to 1,000 active subscribers and 4,000 valid watch hours in the last 12 months.\n\nAnd what\u2019re the implications of this?\n\nThe new policy puts some creators on the platform at a disadvantage, especially those still looking to grow their channels.\n\nRejoice Ambrose, a growing YouTuber running a lifestyle channel, thinks this may be detrimental to her growth.\n\n\u201cI do not think it\u2019s fair. I mean, ads can be so annoying; talk less for those of us who are still trying to grow our channel. How are we going to maintain viewers when they have to endure ads appearing on our videos, and we won\u2019t even get paid for them? But then, it\u2019s their platform; I don\u2019t think we can really do anything about it,\u201d she tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nIn YouTube\u2019s defence, more ads are a part of the company\u2019s investment in solutions that help advertisers reach a larger audience and scale their businesses.\n\nWe previously explored why some Nigerian YouTubers have to look outside the platform to get revenue for reasons like low content engagements because most of their viewers face the issue of low broadband access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these new updates, one can only wonder what the fate of budding and professional Africa-based YouTubers will be, as a large chunk of their audience is in demographics with low access to stable Internet data.\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Government has expressed concern over 16,100 Nigerians killed annually by tobacco, calling for urgent measures and partnerships among relevant stakeholders to check its consumption and reduce the health and other risks associated with tobacco use.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Health, Dr. Osamwonyi Irowa said this while briefing journalists in Benin City in commemoration of the World No Tobacco Day, marked by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other organs to raise awareness and check the consumption of tobacco.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe WHO reports that tobacco kills over 8 million people each year and more than 7 million of these deaths are as a result of direct tobacco use, while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.\n\n\u201cThe Tobacco Atlas 2018 report for Nigeria, estimates more than 16,100 annual deaths from tobacco-related diseases. Also, a research published in 2021 by the Centre for the Study of the Economics of Africa showed that 29,472 deaths were attributable to smoking. It is also pertinent to note that tobacco is the major risk factor for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and is associated with higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death.\u201d\n\nIrowa said the theme for this year\u2019s celebration, \u2018Commit to Quit\u2019 is apt as WHO has set a target of supporting at least 100 million people worldwide in their attempt to quit the use of tobacco by adopting various initiatives such as digital solutions.\n\nIrowa said the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has keyed into the concept of supporting people in the State in quitting tobacco as WHO\u2019s findings have shown that many tobacco users are willing to quit the habit and therefore need support.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe State Government is ever committed to support the Federal Ministry of Health with the WHO on the roll out of Nigeria Tobacco Control Communication Plan, the toll-free line for tobacco cessation in Nigeria and the WhatsApp cessation service, which will be launched by the Honourable Minister of Health today in Abuja.\n\n\u201cToday as we observe World No Tobacco Day, I call on people of all ages, especially the young, to join the fight against the tobacco epidemic. I encourage youth groups to build a movement for a tobacco free generation.\n\n\u201cI urge our celebrities and influencers to join their voices on tobacco cessation; I call on parents, caregivers and teachers to educate children on the harmful effects of tobacco products and the need to stop for those already using it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that the Government of Edo State will continue to implement comprehensive tobacco policies as outlined in the National and WHO framework convention on Tobacco control to help reduce the morbidity and mortality from tobacco use,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has given a notice to the Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC) that it will deduct about N126 billion from its remittance to the Federation Account at the next meeting scheduled for June, amid rising subsidy payments.\n\nIn a report signed by NNPC\u2019s Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, the corporation stated that subsequently, it will begin the subtraction of the balance of an additional N50 billion, being Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery to sustain crude oil production level.\n\nIn the document which detailed the status of the corporation\u2019s finances during its monthly FAAC meeting, which took place between May 19 and 20, the NNPC also confirmed that it did not make any remittance to the Federation Account during the period.\n\nThe development may further throw the three tiers of government, federal, states and local governments, into harsher times next month as they may get less from the Federation Account, as a result of the huge payment the NNPC is paying for subsidy on petrol, ThisDay reported.\n\nIn April, the corporation had notified the Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Ahmed Idris, that it would not be able to remit any funds to the Federation Account in April for distribution in May.\n\nNNPC said it posted a value shortfall of N111.966 billion in February 2021, which would ultimately impact on its ability to contribute to the joint account shared among the federal, state and local governments.\n\nThe corporation attributed the N111.966 billion shortfall to the rising average landing cost of petrol, which jumped to N184 per litre in March as opposed to the existing N128 ex-coastal price.\n\nAccording to the corporation, the N111.966 billion incurred as landing cost would be deducted from April oil and gas proceeds due to the federation in May.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the impact on the federation was not as far-reaching as expected because the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), which collects royalties and bonuses on behalf of the federal government, came to the rescue with the remittance of about $500 million it received from the marginal fields it recently put up for bids.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, had confirmed the role played by DPR in augmenting the FAAC allocation for April, which was shared in May.\n\nThe minister, however, did not disclose how much was paid into the account.\n\nBut the NNPC had in a reaction to the dust raised by the letter to the accountant general, stated that the corporation wasn\u2019t broke, adding that the zero revenue projection only had to do with the federation revenue stream, which it manages and not a general reflection of its overall financial performance.\n\nIn the fresh notice raised by the corporation to deduct N126 billion from its remittance in June, it said it was still shouldering the burden of the differentials from the sale of petrol, which it prefers to call \u201cunder-recovery\u201d.\n\nThe FAAC document added: \u201cNo remittance to Federation Account in April, 2021 (May, 2021 FAAC) due to recorded value shortfall resulting from difference between landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in March, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe sum of N61,966,456,903.74 was deducted out of the total March value shortfall of N111,966,456,903.74. This is to make funds available for JV cost recovery to sustain the existing production level. The balance $50,000,000,000.00 will be deducted in subsequent months.\n\n\u201cIn addition, April value shortfall of N126,298,457,944.36 is to be deducted from May federation proceeds in June 2021 FAAC meeting.\u201d\n\nThe figures further showed that while a net revenue of N90.8 billion was remitted to FAAC in January, N64.1 billion was remitted in February, N41.1 billion was presented in March and zero amount recorded for April.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporation has said that it sold total oil and gas valued at $565.4 million or an equivalent of N214.5 billion in April, according to the document.\n\nNNPC stated that its overall crude oil lifting for both export and domestic in March 2021, recorded 29 per cent decrease relative to the 10.79Mbbls lifted in February 2021.\n\nThe national oil company said Nigeria maintained 1.52 million bpd OPEC production cut in the first quarter of 2021, while export crude oil revenue received in April amounted to $1.89 million, equivalent to N723 million.\n\n\u201cThis represents a 98 per cent decrease compared to March 2021. Domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.13bn,\u201d it added.\n\nIt stated that feedstock valued at $54.6 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period out of which $52.4 million was received during the month, with the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nMCA is a financing agreement whereby the International Oil Companies (IOCs) advance loans to NNPC to invest in upstream projects.\n\nFor other receipts, the corporation stated that $1.25 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in April 2021.\n\nThe data also showed that the exchange rate the CBN sold foreign exchange to the NNPC moved from N379 to N383.47, while N15 billion was spent on government priority projects.\n\nIn the same month, the corporation lost 3.1 million barrels for various reasons, ranging from shut-ins due to repairs, industrial actions, flow line leaks and power failure.\n\nOn the analysis of receipts due in April, gross revenue from JV crude was N124.3 billion, JV gas was N26.1 billion, while N5.8 billion was received from miscellaneous sources, amounting to N156.3 billion.\n\nAfter deduction of royalty, JV cost recovery, profit before tax and taxes, receipts from JV crude came down to N5.5 billion, while that of JV gas stood at N7.8 billion.\n\nOf the March domestic crude oil payable in June by the NNPC, in line with the 90-day payment plan, Chevron Nigeria Limited has roughly 2.89 million barrels valued at N72.6 billion while Eroton\u2019s share is 130,000 barrels valued at N3.1 billion.\n\nAlso, Mobil Producing has 2.84 million litres, valued at N68 billion, Seplat\u2019s is N3.36 billion, SPDC\u2019s share of the JV is N33.6 billion while the value of Total\u2019s crude oil payable in June is N3.1 billion, totalling approximately N184.5 billion or equivalent of $487 million.\n\nAs of March 31, total pre-2016 JV cash call arrears repayment status indicated that JV negotiated debt remained at $4.68 billion, total payment till date is $3.1 billion, while outstanding balance is $1.54 billion, with the exception of Mobil which has been fully paid by the NNPC.\n\nIn April, N938.9 million was spent on security and maintenance, while strategic holdings of the NNPC gulped N740 million, amounting to N1.679 billion.\n\nIn all, 37 vessels imported petrol for the month under review, with landing cost ranging from between N169 and N199.90. Also, a total of N1.48 billion litres were imported for the month, 1.99 billion litres were sold, with depot price remaining at N128 and the recorded loss put at N111.9 billion.\n\nNNPC: Negotiations Ongoing to Acquire Stake in Dangote Refinery,\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari, yesterday clarified that the plan by the corporation to purchase 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote has not been concluded.\n\nKyari, in a text message in response to enquiries by THISDAY on the matter, said the terms of the agreement were being finalised and could be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\nHe added that the NNPC is interested in acquiring a stake in any private refinery with a capacity in excess of 50,000 barrels per day and not just the Dangote Refinery alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Dangote Refinery acquisition, it\u2019s actually an ongoing negotiations that was disclosed by one of our executives. We haven\u2019t concluded; terms are being finalised and may be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to discuss the details at this point. However, the decision is for NNPC to expand her portfolio as is the common practice amongst national oil companies as matter of energy security considerations and risk management. We will take equity from any refinery that plans to process in excess of 50,000 barrels per day, not just the Dangote.\u201d\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated Dangote Refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene, is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce about 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and four million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nParts of this report is credit to ThisDay",

As a charity organization, we decided to serve and assist these people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the official handover of the vehicle in Apapa, Lagos, Mrs. Wunmi Eniola-Jegede, Executive Director, Business Development and Strategic Planning, SIFAX Group said the donation was in line with the company\u2019s robust stakeholder engagement strategy which focuses on the public good of the various sectors the company operates.\n\nShe said: \u201cSIFAX Group appreciates the contributions and impacts of the Mission to Seafarers to the maritime industry. Seafarers tend to be lonely and be far away from relatives and loved ones for a long period of time. This loneliness and long period of absence, if not well managed, could be counterproductive and affect performance. We believe the wellbeing of the seafarers is the wellbeing of the maritime industry.\u2019",

          "title": "Tribute: Dr. Chinyere Aneziokoro \u2013 By KEN-CALEBS OLUMESE",
          "text": "It is my singular honour to perform this unpleasant duty of paying tribute to my young, pretty and precocious niece Dr. Chinyere Ofure Aneziokoro who died in the United States on May 31, 2006 from breast cancer at the unripe age of 40 years. I wish to thank her parents, Emeritus Professor of medicine, Anezi Okoro and Dr. (Mrs) Ese Aneziokoro who initiated, very wisely, the idea of establishing a foundation, the Dr. Chinyere Ofure Aneziokoro Foundation at the College of Medicine, University of Benin in her memory. I also wish to thank the authorities of the University of Benin for granting the request and graciously setting the stage for bringing this idea to fruition. Chinyere was born on April 17, 1966, three months after the turbulent coup of January 15, 1966 in which some important Nigerian leaders were killed. She had her secondary school at the Federal Government Girls College, Abuloma, Port Harcourt and her university education at the Bendel State University Ekpoma, Bendel State. She then proceeded to the University of Nigeria\u2019s College of Medicine in Enugu where she got her degrees in medicine in 1988. She had further studies in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine in the UK and United States and practised her craft meritoriously in both countries. At the time of her death she was an Attending Physician at the Infectious Diseases Section, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Centre in Maywood, Illinois, USA. She was also a leading expert and fellow in infectious diseases who was respected throughout the United States. At the time of her death she had become a member of the Nigerian Medical Association, Medical Women\u2019s Association of Nigeria, British Medical Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America, American College of Physicians, Glasgow Medical Society, UK and the American Medical Association.\n\nShe got married to Dr. Chukwueka N. Ikedionwu on July 16, 1994 and they are blessed with two children, Nnadubem Chigozie and Chizelum Nneoma.\n\nWhile Chinyere was growing up we in my family admired her brilliance and her dedication to her studies and we wondered what she would choose to be in life. But we knew that with her early signs of being a child prodigy and with her early dedication to her studies she would be eminently successful in whatever she would choose to do. When she chose Medicine our joy knew no bounds. Medicine is an interventionist course between life and death. As a famous American writer Mencken once said \u201cone of the chief objects of Medicine is to save us from the natural consequences of our vices and follies.\u201d It does save us sometimes; sometimes it doesn\u2019t because Medicine\u2019s success comes from the doctor\u2019s knowledge, the patient\u2019s obedience and God\u2019s intervention. The relationship between a doctor and a patient is intriguing: The doctor asks the patient what is wrong with him (patient). The patient tells him (doctor) what he thinks is wrong. After that the patient also asks the doctor what then could actually be wrong with him (patient). It is then the doctor\u2019s duty to piece together the information he gathers from the patient and factor it into his diagnosis and treatment. So the doctor serves as the middle man, the intermediary, the problem solver between the patient and death. If his prescription is right the patient survives. If it is wrong the patient may die. So death and Medicine are in a long drawn mortal battle for survival. When Medicine fails, death wins. When Medicine succeeds death loses; it retreats but that retreat is very temporary, some kind of pyrrhic victory for the patient for no victory over death is ever permanent because death is the boss. So when my niece chose Medicine I knew she chose mercy; I knew she chose humaneness; I knew she chose humanity. I knew that we had a doctor in the house and that we would not have to go to the petty medicine seller for treatment or to indulge in self-medication. We knew that we would be saved from sickness worries because when people are sick they hang their hopes on the expertise of the doctor and if you have a doctor in the house, as we did, your confidence was boosted tremendously. But we didn\u2019t avert our mind to the fact that a doctor is as human as the non-doctor, that a doctor can be sick, that a doctor may fail to get a cure for his sickness, that a doctor can die. The reality dawned on us when our niece had breast cancer and she could not cure herself and could not be cured by other doctors. She died. It dawned on us that all persons, doctors and non-doctors, are equal in the presence of death. Chinyere, an expert in infectious diseases died 14 years before the arrival of covid-19 in the world. If she had lived longer she would have been one of the frontline soldiers battling to kill the spread of the virus which has ravaged the world and changed the way we work and live. It is sad that she did not live long enough to put her expertise at the feet of the world at a crucial time such as this. But we take consolation, call it cold comfort, that she lived a very fulfilling and fruitful life in the short time that she lived and made those that she loved and those that she didn\u2019t even know the centre of her gravity the subject of her exertions and the beneficiaries of her love. We can comfort ourselves by saying that since Chinyere still lives in the hearts of those who love her, she is not dead.

          "title": "Tribute: Dr. Chinyere Aneziokoro \u2013 By KEN-CALEBS OLUMESE",
          "text": "It is my singular honour to perform this unpleasant duty of paying tribute to my young, pretty and precocious niece Dr. Chinyere Ofure Aneziokoro who died in the United States on May 31, 2006 from breast cancer at the unripe age of 40 years. I wish to thank her parents, Emeritus Professor of medicine, Anezi Okoro and Dr. (Mrs) Ese Aneziokoro who initiated, very wisely, the idea of establishing a foundation, the Dr. Chinyere Ofure Aneziokoro Foundation at the College of Medicine, University of Benin in her memory. I also wish to thank the authorities of the University of Benin for granting the request and graciously setting the stage for bringing this idea to fruition. Chinyere was born on April 17, 1966, three months after the turbulent coup of January 15, 1966 in which some important Nigerian leaders were killed. She had her secondary school at the Federal Government Girls College, Abuloma, Port Harcourt and her university education at the Bendel State University Ekpoma, Bendel State. She then proceeded to the University of Nigeria\u2019s College of Medicine in Enugu where she got her degrees in medicine in 1988. She had further studies in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine in the UK and United States and practised her craft meritoriously in both countries. At the time of her death she was an Attending Physician at the Infectious Diseases Section, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Centre in Maywood, Illinois, USA. She was also a leading expert and fellow in infectious diseases who was respected throughout the United States. At the time of her death she had become a member of the Nigerian Medical Association, Medical Women\u2019s Association of Nigeria, British Medical Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America, American College of Physicians, Glasgow Medical Society, UK and the American Medical Association.\n\nShe got married to Dr. Chukwueka N. Ikedionwu on July 16, 1994 and they are blessed with two children, Nnadubem Chigozie and Chizelum Nneoma.\n\nWhile Chinyere was growing up we in my family admired her brilliance and her dedication to her studies and we wondered what she would choose to be in life. But we knew that with her early signs of being a child prodigy and with her early dedication to her studies she would be eminently successful in whatever she would choose to do. When she chose Medicine our joy knew no bounds. Medicine is an interventionist course between life and death. As a famous American writer Mencken once said \u201cone of the chief objects of Medicine is to save us from the natural consequences of our vices and follies.\u201d It does save us sometimes; sometimes it doesn\u2019t because Medicine\u2019s success comes from the doctor\u2019s knowledge, the patient\u2019s obedience and God\u2019s intervention. The relationship between a doctor and a patient is intriguing: The doctor asks the patient what is wrong with him (patient). The patient tells him (doctor) what he thinks is wrong. After that the patient also asks the doctor what then could actually be wrong with him (patient). It is then the doctor\u2019s duty to piece together the information he gathers from the patient and factor it into his diagnosis and treatment. So the doctor serves as the middle man, the intermediary, the problem solver between the patient and death. If his prescription is right the patient survives. If it is wrong the patient may die. So death and Medicine are in a long drawn mortal battle for survival. When Medicine fails, death wins. When Medicine succeeds death loses; it retreats but that retreat is very temporary, some kind of pyrrhic victory for the patient for no victory over death is ever permanent because death is the boss. So when my niece chose Medicine I knew she chose mercy; I knew she chose humaneness; I knew she chose humanity. I knew that we had a doctor in the house and that we would not have to go to the petty medicine seller for treatment or to indulge in self-medication. We knew that we would be saved from sickness worries because when people are sick they hang their hopes on the expertise of the doctor and if you have a doctor in the house, as we did, your confidence was boosted tremendously. But we didn\u2019t avert our mind to the fact that a doctor is as human as the non-doctor, that a doctor can be sick, that a doctor may fail to get a cure for his sickness, that a doctor can die. The reality dawned on us when our niece had breast cancer and she could not cure herself and could not be cured by other doctors. She died. It dawned on us that all persons, doctors and non-doctors, are equal in the presence of death. Chinyere, an expert in infectious diseases died 14 years before the arrival of covid-19 in the world.

          "title": "BREAKING: Buhari Has Failed Nigeria, I\u2019ll Run For President In 2023 To Tackle APC \u2013 Moghalu",
          "text": "The former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Kingsley Moghalu, has declared his intention to run for president in 2023.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari led government has failed Nigerians, hence there is need for him to save the nation from collapsing.\n\nSee his full statement below:\n\n2023: I WILL RUN BECAUSE WE THE PEOPLE MATTER\n\nWhat is the value of a Nigerian life?\n\nWe live daily today under the shadow of terrorists. Our economy is collapsing. Many families cannot afford the price of food. Millions of young men and women have no jobs and have no hope\n\nOur university students know more about ASUU strikes and long school closures than any skills they need to be competitive in the world of the 21st century.\n\nOnly the rich and powerful can access quality healthcare in our country or abroad as medical tourists, because our health system, like most other systems, is broken. I lost my father, Isaac Moghalu, in December 1998 because he had a stroke but the doctors were on strike, and therefore we could not get him adequate healthcare on time.\n\nSoon after we found a private clinic and moved him there, he went into a coma and passed on shortly afterwards. I was heartbroken. Today, 23 years later, not much has changed. Like many, I have suffered the effects of bad governance in our country.\n\nWith life in it increasingly nasty, brutish and short, the very idea of Nigeria is now almost meaningless to many Nigerians. Cries for self-determination fill the air in response to fundamental injustice.\n\nMeanwhile, politics in Nigeria does not bring change, and its benefits go to only one group \u2013 the political elite. Their message is loud and clear: we the people \u2014you and I \u2013 DO NOT matter.\n\nThe bodies of Nigerians are buried in cold corners of foreign cemeteries, strewn across the Sahara desert, and float in the Mediterranean Sea, as a consequence of a non-existent leadership. Our country can no longer speak confidently in the gathering of nations.\n\nLife as ordained by our Creator, that we may experience His Goodness in this land of the living, has eluded us as a people.\n\nOnly the emergence of visionary, competent and inclusive national leadership, on the one hand, and a fundamental restructuring of Nigeria based on a new people\u2019s constitution, on the other, can arrest Nigeria\u2019s ongoing disorderly and violent degeneration into a completely failed state. We were not born to be miserable and to die miserable. Enough is Enough!\n\nIt is now more than ever necessary that we elect in 2023 a leader who is TRULY committed and has the capacity to initiate the constitutional restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nA leader who is competent to secure our lives and property, successfully manage our diversity, save our economy, and restore our international respect.\n\nFor the sake of the youth of our country \u2014 including my four children \u2014 whose future is being drowned in reckless foreign borrowing, and for the sake of all Nigerians suffering and seeking a clear alternative to the status quo, I intend \u2014 with all humility \u2014 to present myself \u2014 again \u2014 as a candidate for the Office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.\n\nIf elected, I will run a government with a dream team of highly competent Nigerians from all parts of our country. Along with strengthened, independent institutions, we will deliver results on a 4-point agenda in four years (4 by 4):\n\n\u2014 Security for all Nigerians and Nigeria\u2019s territory;\n\n\u2014 War against poverty: skills, jobs for our youth, and an innovation economy;\n\n\u2014 Accelerated education and healthcare reform;\n\n\u2014 Good governance: inclusive, transparent, effective, and accountable.\n\nThis is my SWAG Agenda for a 21st century Nigeria. I seek the support of all compatriots \u2014 of everyone who is tired of our present national situation. We also need the energy and support of our youth, the middle class, entrepreneurs, and our compatriots in the diaspora.\n\nThese important segments of our population have in the past been reluctant to engage actively in our electoral process, ostensibly because of the flaws in that process.\n\nThe National Assembly @nassnigeriamust now pass into law, without further delay, necessary electoral reforms that will make democracy yield real dividends for Nigerians. Our votes must count, and be counted transparently. The amendments should include a provision for\n\nDiaspora Nigerians to be able to register and vote in all elections in Nigeria from abroad.\n\nI am only one face of a movement. A movement of silent and suffering Nigerians fed up with the insecurity, poverty, and a seemingly hopeless future for our country. A movement that has decided that Enough is Enough.\n\nThat movement, soon to be present in our numbers in every voting ward in Nigeria, will announce within the next few months the political party we will join en masse and seek its platform for the presidential, legislative and gubernatorial roles in governance.\n\nWe can do this. We can change Nigeria.\n\nTogether, let us walk this road to a Nigeria that, within 30 years of successive administrations, will have achieved the kind of economic and technological advancement attained by countries such as Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates within similar timeframes. It is possible. We only need to participate actively in the democratic process, and vote right when the time comes.\n\nWe the Nigerian people matter. We the Nigerian people deserve better. Let\u2019s do this. Because we can and we must.\n\n[Signed]\n\nKingsley Chiedu Moghalu, Ph.D. OON FCIB\n\nIfekaego Nnewi\n\nJune 1, 2021\n\nMoghalu4Nigeria.org\n\nkingsleymoghalu.com\n\n#Ends",

          "text": "Barely 24 hours after 200 school children were abducted by bandits in Niger, gunmen again attacked another community killing 15 villagers in Beri town in Bobi district of Mariga local government of the state Monday morning.\n\nIt was learnt that one mobile policeman was also killed by the bandits during the attack.\n\nIt was however gathered that the local vigilantes were able to kill 5 of the bandits in a gun duel.\n\nAn eye witness account recounted thus: \u201cThe Beri Police Station was burnt by the bandits with several people reported to have been injured during the stampede that accompanied the arson on the police station.\u201d\n\nAnd while the attack was on, another group of bandits were reported to have stormed yet another village, Garin-Gabas of the same local government of the state but were successfully repelled by the youths.\n\nAlso this Monday, some bandits reportedly raided Ungwan Bako in the Kotonkoro district of Mariga local government, abducting many people, mostly women and children.\n\nHowever, casualty figures and number of people kidnapped in these two other incidents could not be ascertained as at the time of writing this report\n\nThe Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) confirmed the incidents but did not give details.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer of the state Police Command, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, did not respond to calls made to his cell phones for comments on the developments.\n\nGov Bello jets out for solution\n\nTo address the lingering banditry in the state, Governor Sani Bello \u2013 a few hours after the kidnap of about 200 students from Saliu Tanko Islamic School on Sunday \u2013 left Nigeria in search of solution.\n\nThe governor\u2019s media aide, Mary Noel-Berje said: \u201cThe governor, who had left the country to explore all possibilities of strengthening the state\u2019s security architecture before the incident happened, is expected back soon.\u201d\n\nShe further stated that the governor had given directives to the security operatives and state government officials to do all they can towards ensuring the safe return of the abducted Tegina Islamiyya children and others.\n\n\u201cThe governor is expected back in the country within the shortest period of time and has assured the rescue and safe return of the children.\n\n\u201cGovernor Sani Bello also assured all Nigerlites that the government will continue to do all it can to protect the lives and property of its citizens while guaranteeing the continued peace and stability of the state.\n\n\u201cWhile assuring the parents of the abducted children of their safe return as the security agencies have been directed to do all it can to bring back the children as soon as possible, the governor also urged the citizens to cooperate and share intelligence and information that will help in the quick rescue of the children,\u201d Berje further said.\n\nHow the bandits abducted the school children\n\nThe bandits reportedly seized the police station in the town and went round the town shooting sporadically into the air to scare residents before breaking into a private school where they abducted children attending Islamic lectures.\n\nThe school, which consists of nursery and primary schools, also hosts Islamiyya students in the evening and at weekends.\n\nThe mass abduction of the Islamic school students was the second in Rafi local government area in six months.\n\nDozens of students were earlier in the year kidnapped at Government Science College (GSC) Kagara but were later released after negotiation with the state government.\n\nAsides from the attack on schools, several residents across different local government areas of the state have been displaced after the invasion of bandits.\n\nDeath toll rises in Ebonyi\n\nIn a related development, the death toll in the three communities of Ebonyi -Benue borders attacked by suspected herders had risen to 42.\n\nThe suspected armed herders had Saturday morning invaded Odoke Ishieke, Obakota Ishieke and Ndiobasi Ishieke communities all in Ebonyi local government area of Ebonyi state and killed over 30 persons not leaving behind pregnant women and nursing mothers.\n\nThe communities has common boundaries with Ardo local government area of Benue state and since the invasion, security agents have been recovering dead bodies from bushes in the affected areas.\n\nA resident of one of the area who simply gave his name as Nwegede told Blueprint that 31 bodies were recovered in Ndiobasi Ishieke, 6 in Odoke Ishieke and 15 bodies in Obakota Ishieke.\n\nHe said: \u201cHerdsmen butchered Izzi people like this at Nwori Ndiobashi side. Most of the victims are at Sudan Hospital Onuenyimu right now battling machetes and gunshot injuries.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many victims of the attack are still receiving treatment at the Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki 2 (FETHA2) and AMURT-a health centre close to the scene of the incidents.\n\nA stakeholder from the affected communities and Commissioner for Capital City Development, Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi said over 30 bodies were evcuated from bushes around the affected communities while soldiers were still recovering more bodies.\n\n\u201cIt is a very unfortunate situation. We got a very sad news yesterday morning that armed herdsmen invaded Izzi land particularly in a place called Ndiobashi and killed so many of our people. We quickly alerted the security agencies to come to their aid but unfortunately, the Benue state government who claimed ownership of the area could not respond positively.\n\n\u201cBut we commend the Governor of Ebonyi state who upon hearing the incident, swung into action even though the land is in dispute and sent the security agencies to repel the attacks. As I speak to you, over 30 bodies have been evacuated and as I talk, the soldiers are still evacuating more dead bodies in the bush.\n\n\u201cI visited there yesterday and the victims narrated their ordeals but of a truth, the area is in disarray. People are panicking but we have been able to encourage them to complement the efforts of the security agencies to beef up security in the area so that the ugly incident doesn\u2019t reoccur,\u201d he said.\n\nOne killed in Gombe\n\nSimilarly, the Gombe state government has confirmed the attack that left one dead and over 50 houses burnt in parts of Shongom and Filiya District in Shongom local government area of the state.\n\nAddressing newsmen Monday shortly after an emergency security meeting by the State Security Council, the state Commissioner of Information, Mr Julius Ishaya, confirmed the attack and assured the council was working to restore peace in the affected area.\n\nWhile noting the extent of damage by the attackers, the commissioner said, \u201cbased on security report, over 50 houses were burnt, including food and other essential items of the people.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner revealed that while condemning the carnage, the council called for the immediate engagement of stakeholders from the affected area under the chairmanship of the paramount ruler of the Kaltungo chiefdom, Alhaji Sale Muhammad to find solution and restore peace to the area.\n\n\u201cThe council reiterated that the banning of militia or hunter groups still stands. The security agents have been alerted on that, so anybody who behaves like a militia or a hunter will be handled appropriately by the security agents\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the state\u2019s Commissioner of Internal Security and Ethical Orientation, Adamu Dishi Kupto, directed security agencies in the state to investigate the attack and ensure perpetrators were brought to justice.\n\nWhile urging residents in Gombe to break off from the act of taking laws into their hands Mr Kupto said: \u201cGod has created us to be and live together so we don\u2019t have to question him on why are we are living together despite our differences.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Mai of Kaltungo, Engr. Sale Muhammad, assured that the chiefdom would continue to sensitise its people to embrace and live peacefully with one another.\n\nI fear for Nigeria \u2013 Cleric\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Vicar General of the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Rt. Rev. Msgr. John Asuquo Aniagwu has expressed worry over the wanton destruction of lives and properties in different parts of Nigeria.\n\nHe urged the federal government to urgently address the various agitations across the country in order to save the country from being plunged into a civil war.\n\n\n\nThe Catholic priest said the palpable apprehensions in the different parts of the country were dangerous signal to its political, social and economic stability.\n\n\n\nMsgr Aniagwu, who is the Parish Priest of St. Leo\u2019s Catholic Church, Ikeja, Lagos, told journalists that the National Assembly needed not to embark on consultations across the geopolitical zones for inputs on a new constitution, describing it as an exercise in futility.\n\n\n\nThe Vicar General said: \u201cI feel apprehension, I don\u2019t know where we are going and I fear that the worst may happen still with those who should do something fails to do what we should do. Every day, we see agitation here and there and one doesn\u2019t know where the next bad news is going to come from? Every day we are hearing of killing here and there, initially it was in the north east, we were all concerned, praying for them there, the crisis moved to the North West and now it is all over the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I have great apprehension and fear about what may befall this nation and I am praying that the worst should not happen because the way it is going, it tell me that there will be escalation of all types of tension in the country, the violence in the different parts of the country simultaneously does not speak well for the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the federal government should visit reports of the constitution conferences of 2005 and 2014 and implement parts of the recommendations in the two documents as part of solutions to address the current unrest.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are so many voices clamouring for change in this country. In 2005, President Obasanjo convoked a national conference in Abuja, I was a delegate to that conference, we spent 5 months in Abuja during the conference, we produced copious reports and some of the things they are talking about now, restructuring, dissolution of power, a new constitution, reform of the electoral processes, and we discussed all those things.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly at that time said we have no locus standi and our reports were never looked at, it\u2019s there gathering dusk wherever it is.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2014, there was another conference by the Jonathan administration that came out with far reaching recommendations which the government of the day again refused to take onboard. So it is not as if people are not talking but of course the ruling government has to at least agree to look at these things on their merit. Whatever is good take it, whatever is not good put it aside but to completely rubbish it and said we don\u2019t want to see it I think is the act of arrogance as if they have the monopoly of wisdom.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "A two-day zonal public hearing of the Senate on the review of the 1999 Constitution on Thursday ended with stakeholders from the North-East demanding the creation of additional states, 25 per cent derivation, gender equality, free and compulsory education, among others.\n\nThe exercise was organised by the Senate in 12 centres across the country to collate the views of Nigerians on the key areas to be amended in the 1999 Constitution in order to address agitations in the country.\n\nIn Bauchi centre, the people of Southern Borno comprising nine local government areas on Thursday disagreed with the position of the Borno State government and insisted on the creation of Savannah State.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after presenting their memorandum, a representative of the movement for the creation of Savannah State and former Secretary to Borno State government, Ambassador Dauda Danladi said the southern part of the state is being marginalised, hence the need for the new state.\n\nThe speaker of Borno State House Assembly, Abdulkarim Lawan had on Wednesday kicked against the creation of an additional state from Borno, which was demanded by the stakeholders in September last year in a letter to the Senate.\n\nIn the document, the group said the move was necessary as Borno is the largest in the country in terms of landmass to enhance self-determination, compatibility, equitable and even development, and responsive governance.\n\nWith the proposed capital in Damboa, they further said it will comprise nine LGAs in Southern Borno Senatorial District \u2013 Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani.\n\n\u201cWe the people of Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani Local Government Areas of Borno State wish to present our request for the creation of Savannah State out of the present Borno State.\n\n\u201cWe had before now presented requests for the creation of this proposed State at various times in recent years. Between 1982, 1983 and 1996 a request was made by the people of these Local Government Areas of the former Borno State for the Creation of Savannah State to the National Assembly of the Second Republic\n\n\u201cDuring the agitation across the country in 1991 for the creation of more States, requests were made for the creation of two States out of the former Borno State, namely; Savannah and Yobe States. The request for the creation of Yobe State was granted.\n\n\u201cWe had also earlier submitted this request to the National Constitutional Conference through its Committee on the States Creation. The move to kick start the process of reviewing the 1999 constitution then, which could accommodate states and local governments creation along with necessary boundary adjustments was indeed a welcome development and we enthusiastically participated.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, we equally submitted our request to the National Conference Committee on states creation. That effort resulted in the shortlisting of SAVANNAH State as one of the fourteen (14) states recommended for creation in Nigeria. The 2014 Conference report has again clearly shown that SAVANNAH state met all necessary criteria for the creation of the state in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo us, this present move by your humble and esteem selves to Kick-start the process of review of the 1999 Constitution which could accommodate States and Local Government Creation and necessary boundary adjustments, is indeed a welcome stride and we pray that our submission will again receive the blessing of the National Assembly. It is in this regard that we wish to respectfully submit our memorandum for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE with its proposed capital at DAMBOA.\n\n\u201cUnder and in fulfilment of the provisions of section 8(1)(a) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, all the democratically elected members at the National, State and local government levels representing the area demanding for the creation of Savannah State, have after consideration of the long time yearnings and aspirations of the people of the proposed state, endorsed this noble request for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE.\n\n\u201cGiven the opportunities provided by the State creation to bring Government closer to the people and to foster even and rapid development, the people of the proposed Savannah State who are eager to bring about balanced and accelerated development are making this passionate appeal for your kind consideration of our request for the creation of Savannah State,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe letter further said \u201cin making our demand for curving out Savannah State out of the present Borno State, we have been motivated by our desire to bring Government closer to our people and to accelerate rapid and even development of the sub-region as well as the need to remain united within the context of the New State and the Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the creation of Savannah State out of the present BornoState will make it possible for both states to plan and provide the basis for integrated and even development and thus create more investment and employment opportunities for our people.\n\n\u201cThe proposed Savannah State is richly endowed with Solid Minerals, agricultural products, tourism potentials and human resources that can be harnessed to lay a solid foundation for the transformation of the State.\n\n\u201cIt is an incontrovertible fact that greater part of both the human and material resources of the present Borno state come from the southern part. We are confident that the resources available to the proposed savannah state can sustain it, and make it even more viable than many already established state.\u201d\n\nAmong the mineral resources listed are quartz, limestone, iron ore and magnesium.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Stock Market Sheds $2bn in May as Investors Weigh Options",
          "text": "The rally witnessed in Nigeria\u2019s equities market in April was halted in May as rising yields in the fixed income securities market reduced demand by investors.\n\nOwing to this, the market, which gained N418 billion in April, depreciated further by N812 billion in May.\n\nThe market capitalisation fell from N20.847 trillion at the beginning of the month to close at N20.035 trillion yesterday. Similarly, the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 3.5 per cent from 39,834.42 to 38,437.88 on Monday.\n\nThe 2020 full year and 2021 first quarter(Q1) corporate earnings had triggered high demand for stocks, leading to a gain in April after a bear run in February and March.\n\nHowever, the gain could not be sustained in May following indecision among traders, who are weighing their options on whether or not to shift investments to the rising yields in the fixed income market and other investment options.\n\nFor instance, yield on long-term 30-year sovereign bond has appreciated from seven per cent in December 2020 to 14.2 per cent last Friday and more institutional investors and other risk averse traders are getting attracted to the investment space.\n\nCommenting on the market performance, the Chief Research Officer, Investdata Consulting, Mr. Ambrose Omordion, said the weak outcome resulted partly from indecision among the traders despite better-than-expected corporate earnings in the midst of weak economic data and rising insecurity challenges.\n\n\u201cThe low traded volume and mixed sentiment for the month May is a reflection of inactive position of institutional investors as recovery yields in the fixed income space is diverting funds from the stock market.\n\n\u201cWith the outcome of last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, prevailing economic data and corporate earnings that are looking up, we envisage a reversal in trend as March year end accounts have started to hit the market and half-year interim dividend/ earnings season is underway. \u201cCoupled with oil price trading around $70, we have projected the year 2021 to close positively despite the ongoing mix trend here and there.\n\n\u201cThis is a vaccine year with breakthroughs in vaccines that had led to global vaccination, which are supporting economic recovery of different climates and oil prices in the international market. The month negative performance is an opportunity for discerning investors and traders to position and build wealth,\u201d Omordion added.\n\nEarlier, some operators and analysts had said the rising yields might prevent the rally witnessed in April from extending to other months.\n\nThe Executive Director, NOVA Merchant Bank, Mrs. Funke Okoya, had said whilst rising yield might undercut the rally on equities in the months ahead, the discounted valuation on stocks was an opportunity for passive investors to build portfolios, capable of delivering superior returns over the long term.\n\nOkoya stated that as much as the rising yield presents a downside risk to equity offerings and they continue to rebalance clients\u2019 portfolio to reflect their proactive view on the different segments of the market and broader macro outlook, they remained buyers of equities.\n\nShe said: \u201cAlbeit we are very selective in our stock options and this is perhaps one of those times when it is clinically important for portfolio managers to ensure investment decisions on discretionary portfolios are strictly aligned with client profiling, which is one of our fundamental guiding principles in either advising clients or managing their wealth.\n\n\u201cThe rising yield environment also reinforce the call of NOVA Merchant Bank\u2019s investment banking subsidiary for corporate clients to accelerate their debt capital plans and execution, to take advantage of the yield environment, which has seen a steep rise over the past four months.\u201d\n\nA financial analyst, Abiola Rasaq, said with rising yield on fixed income market, investors might be reducing exposure to equities, a phenomenon which may reflect the moderating risk appetite of both retail and institutional investors.\n\n\u201cNotably, the search for higher return on investments, which stimulated capital flows into equity market late 2020 and early 2021, especially from local pensions and traditional asset managers, is gradually easing, given considerable rise in yield on fixed income securities, which have seen average of 550 basis points rise year-to-date,\u201d Rasaq said.\n\nAccording to him, though real interest rate or put differently the inflation-adjusted return on fixed income securities is still negative given the 50-month-high headline inflation rate of 18.17 per cent, compared to the average 14.1 per cent yield on the 30-year benchmark bond, the year-to-date rise in interest rate (using the Soverign yield curve as a proxy) was likely to undermine cash allocation to equities, especially as institutional investors may become concerned that higher inflation and relatively weak economic recovery may weaken corporate earnings growth in the near term.\n\nHe said: \u201cDouble-digit return on risk-free sovereign notes may unfortunately undermine some progress made over the past 18 months, when the lower interest rate environment partly helped in reducing the crowd-out effect of public sector borrowing in stimulating capital flow to the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoddy Egene",

The state also records instances of farmer-herdsmen conflict and carry a distinct possibility of sudden violent outbreaks,\u201d the report added.\n\nIn Kwara, it identified civil unrest as a major threat factor in the state, fuelled by clashes between commercial drivers and government forces, communal clashes and ethno-religious skirmishes within the metropolis.\n\nHowever, in Lagos, which scored highest in terms of general security, the company stated that high road usage and poor travel conditions result in an increased risk of road traffic accidents within the state.\n\n\u201cCult and gang activities also threaten business travel within the state, especially in communities under Ikorodu and Badagry LGAs. Additional layers of security are advised to maintain personal safety in some areas,\u201d it added.\n\nIn Niger, insurgency and kidnapping were listed as major threat factors, while in Ogun, repeated attacks by rogue herdsmen on farming settlements in Odogbolu, and Imeko-Afon LGAs increase travel risk along that axis.\n\nIt is the same for Ondo, where clashes between herders and farmers are also prevalent in the state, while Osun State faces heightened risk of gunmen attack and cult and gang activities have a free reign.\n\nIt said that Plateau State carried a high kidnap risk, especially along expressways with reduced government security forces visibility as well as record of farmer-herdsmen conflict.\n\nGunmen attacks are a threat for business travellers in Rivers State, according to the report, as cult and gang activities are another major threat for business travellers within the state.\n\nTaraba State faces attacks by rogue herdsmen in Wukari and Karim Lamido , especially, the PR24 report said.\n\n\u201cTakum and Jalingo LGAs also carry increased threat ratings at this time, due to reported incidents of bandit attacks on the citizenry and security forces posted in the area,\u201d the advisory added.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Monday unfolded plans to acquire shares in five more private refineries in Nigeria, bringing to six its interests in refineries it is targeting.\n\nThe corporation, which had earlier indicated interest in acquiring 20 per cent stake in the 650,000 barrels per day upcoming Dangote Refinery in Lagos, said its interest in acquiring equity participation in some private refineries was in line with extant federal government policy.\n\nThe NNPC stated that the policy stipulates the mandatory participation of the corporation in any privately-owned refinery that exceeds 50,000 barrels per day capacity in keeping with its statutory role of safeguarding national energy security.\n\nNNPC, in a statement in Abuja by its spokesman, Dr. Kennie Obateru, said it had identified at least six refinery projects in which it would seek equity participation, with five of them at the development stage while the Dangote Refinery is the largest of them.\n\nIt added that NNPC as a national oil company primarily has a dual role of providing stewardship for the nation\u2019s hydrocarbon resources and adding value to the resources for the benefit of all Nigerians and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThese roles enable it to achieve the twin objectives of providing energy security for the country and stimulating the nation\u2019s economic development and growth,\u201d NNPC stated.\n\nThe statement said that NNPC\u2019s strategic plan to ensure energy security and stimulate economic growth with limited resources required it to consider strategic partnerships with competent investors in sectors of the oil and gas value chain, especially where it currently operates on a sole risk basis.\n\nAccording to the corporation, the oil refining sector is one of such segments where it is revisiting its strategy in order to strengthen domestic refining capacity and guarantee national energy security.\n\n\u201cThe new vision is to grow domestic refining capacity, improve petroleum products supply from our local refineries and become a net exporter of petroleum product,\u201d it stated.\n\nNNPC assured all stakeholders that the move to seek equity participation in the private refineries will not undercut its commitment to the rehabilitation of its refineries and strengthening the domestic refining sector.\n\nIt stated that the overall goal is to boost the nation\u2019s refining capacity with a view to becoming a net exporter of petroleum products soon and to grow the nation\u2019s economy.",

          "title": "Nigeria Concludes Marginal Field Bid Round, 80 Winners Get Award Certificates",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) on Monday concluded the 2020 marginal oilfield bid round, the first successful bid since 2003 when 24 assets were put on offer.\n\nThe process, which culminated in the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator, started in June last year, with 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore put up for lease by the federal government.\n\nHowever, during the bid round, the DPR stated that 161 successful companies were shortlisted to advance to the final stage. Those shortlisted were selected from 591 entities that applied for pre-qualification.\n\nMarginal fields are smaller oil blocks typically developed by indigenous companies and have remained unproduced for a period of over 10 years.\n\nSome of the companies, which emerged winners included: Matrix Energy, AA Rano, Andova Plc, Duport Midstream, Genesis Technical, Twin Summit, Bono Energy, Deep Offshore Integrated, Oodua Oil, MRS and Petrogas.\n\nOthers are: North Oils and Gas, Pierport, Metropole, Pioneer Global, Shepherd Hill, Akata, NIPCO, Aida, YY Connect, Accord Oil, Pathway Oil, Tempo Oil and Virgin Forest, among others.\n\nIt was a big win for local oil and gas companies, which had a good outing during the ceremony as 100 per cent of the beneficiaries of the exercise were indigenous entities.\n\nNigeria last conducted marginal field bid rounds in 2003, with 16 of the fields now contributing just two per cent to the national oil and gas reserves, a figure the DPR said would be substantially boosted by the latest exercise, worth about $500 million in signature bonuses.\n\nAt the presentation of letters to the winners, DPR Director, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, stated that a total of 591 firms submitted expression of interest forms, out of which 540 were pre-qualified, while 482 were bids submitted by 405 applicants.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the end, 161 companies were shortlisted as potential awardees, out of which 50 per cent has met all conditions and therefore eligible for awards today. We are set to ensure opportunities are extended to other deserving applicants to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cThe DPR is not just a regulator, we are an opportunity house. We drive creativity and transformation and we use these in all of our activities. This is done in the overriding national interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bid will enhance economic growth, increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and create employment, while with the experience garnered before now, mistakes of the past will be avoided.\n\nHe said that the desire of the government was for the awardees to hit \u201cfirst oil\u201d in record time, adding that a technical workshop will be organised with all bid winners for guidance on field development and operations.\n\nHe pledged to support the bid winners to operate within the country\u2019s oil and gas space, urging them to take advantage of the oil and gas centre recently inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cDespite the daunting challenges of the triple force (oil price crash, global pandemic and production cuts) in 2020, which dealt a severe blow on the world market and global economy, the DPR forged ahead with government aspirations for the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the exercise was carried out in two phases, expression of interest and prequalification, as well as technical and financial phase.\n\nHe said the phase one ensured that applicants were subjected to screening of basic documentations such as shareholders\u2019 details, directors, management team, procedures and systems, legal and association status, basic technical capability, financial capability and corporate accountability.\n\nAuwalu stated that the DPR has now provided opportunities through the marginal field bid round to indigenous operators for wealth creation and economic growth consistent with government\u2019s drive for increased GDP, employment generation and improved revenue.\n\n\u201cThe DPR will continue to follow up and guide the awardees every step of the way. For instance, a guiding template of working agreement has been drafted for joint awardees and discussions have reached advanced stage between DPR and lease holders on the Farmout agreement and other technical enablers,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Head, Basinal Assessment and Lease Administration (BALA) of the organisation, Mr. Edu Inyang, said when the exercise was being embarked upon, the objectives were to increase indigenous participation in the oil and gas industry, increase reserves, rev up technological transfer, attract investment and enhance revenue generation.\n\nHe stated that a large part of the objectives had been achieved, with the culmination of the process in the presentation of letters.\n\nAssistant Director, DPR, Mr. Abel Nsa, in his remarks, said with the revocation of 11 licences, Nigeria was losing a lot of revenue, with taxes and royalties not being paid on the assets, leaving about 40 million barrels unproduced and many opportunities missed.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh",
