But it seems we\u2019ve been scammed,\u201d he said.\n\nNigerians spreading the virus without knowing\n\nReacting swiftly to the speculation, Director-General of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Prof. Babatunde Salako, stressed that what Nigerians are experiencing are most likely symptoms of Omicron, as a result of the fourth wave of COVID-19.\n\nSalako further disclosed that, unlike the Delta variant, Omicron is a milder strain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with having AA genotype as some people speculated. I am not completely ruling out the possibility but it has to be scientifically proven.\n\n\u201cYou will see lots of infections and asymptomatic people around but you won\u2019t see severe diseases or deaths. The fact is that some people have been vaccinated and there had been community infection. People have already come in contact with the virus and developed natural antibodies to fight it. I believe that is the reason why we haven\u2019t seen many severe diseases as a result of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cSome of the Omicron symptoms such as common cold, cough, catarrh, sneezing and sore throats are what we see people exhibit these days,\u201d he said.\n\nHe disclosed further that the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research in recent times has been sequencing several samples, which suggested the country is experiencing a spike in the cases of Omicron, more than other variants.\n\nThere has been an \u2018explosion\u2019 of infections driven by the new variant, he said.\n\n\u201cThe variant is everywhere. You know people don\u2019t like to be identified as a carrier of the virus, largely because of the initial fear that followed its outbreak that it was a death sentence.\n\n\u201cFor instance, I have a staff member who has been coughing for some time. When we asked her to go for the COVID-19 test, she screamed, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have COVID. Nothing is wrong with me. I am okay\u201d But I persisted. When the result came out, it was positive. She stood staring at me looking confused,\u201d he noted.\n\nGenotype has nothing to do with cough, catarrh\n\nA Consultant Public Health Physician at the University of Ilorin, Prof. Tanimola Akande, also said there is no link between the AA genotype and malaria infection, noting that people pushing the narrative are misinforming the public.\n\nAccording to him, there is no scientific evidence linking the AA genotype to the spike in cases of cough, catarrh and fever.\n\n\u201cThe surge in such symptoms is usually associated with the onset of harmattan weather in Nigeria. In addition, the transmission of COVID-19 Omicron variant may be another factor,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria expressed concerns that Nigerians are not going for the COVID-19 test.\n\nThis is even as he noted that the poor compliance to non-pharmaceutical intervention and other preventive protocols can spike COVID-19 transmission in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt from available data that we are already in the fourth wave of COVID-19 infection and this has been confirmed by the NCDC,\u201d he said.\n\nA clinical haematologist, Dr. Wole Banjoko, however, thinks otherwise.\n\nBanjoko, who spoke with PUNCH HealthWise via phone said, \u201cGenotype can affect some things but the cough is not one of them.\n\n\u201cOne of them is malaria. People with AA are more prone, people with SS are most prone while people with AS genotype are the least prone. Symptoms like cough and catarrh connote different ailments entirely.\n\n\u201cThis is why I agree that very many people are walking about today without knowing they have it.

          "title": "Bolaji Akinyemi @80: A Tribute",
          "text": "Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi\n\nBy Kingsley Moghalu\n\nIn the long arc of any country\u2019s history, many men and women hold offices and titles in public life. In Nigeria, that is the claim to fame of many such personalities. But if their value addition, individually and collectively, had been significant, our country would have been in better shape than it is today.\n\nFor few have transcended \u201cbeing\u201d to \u201cdoing\u201d, leaving behind indisputable, inspirational legacies. Few have the capacity for ideas \u2013 a deep, reflective intellectual mind as a basis for policy actions, decisions and recommendations that create the kind of impact that outlives them. Even fewer still can reinvent themselves after office and remain relevant long after they have been has-beens.\n\nAkinwande Bolaji Akinyemi CFR, Professor of Political Science, Director-General of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs from 1975 to 1983, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria from 1985 to 1987, Member of the Justice Mohammed Uwais Electoral Reform Committee in 2007, and Deputy Chairman of the 2014 National Conference, is one of such men.\n\nBorn in llesha in today\u2019s Osun State on January 4, 1942 the son of a famous school Principal father, the Rev. James Akinyemi, Bolaji Akinyemi turns 80 today. My task here, as a younger friend for whom he was a role model in my teenage years, and as a citizen who has known him for 32 years, is not to recite his long and illustrious curriculum vita.\n\nIt is to interpret that CV and its owner, to give my view of why and how Bolaji Akinyemi accomplished the feats he did and what they mean for Nigeria, Africa and the black race, and why he still commands strong public influence and attention long after he left public office.\n\nThis man\u2019s knowledge of the world is encyclopaedic. He is nothing short of Kissingerian in his impact on Nigerian foreign policy at a time when our country still had a strong presence in world politics. That impact, in a relatively short period of two years as foreign minister, was no accident.\n\nAlthough he previously headed the NIIA for eight years and so was already well known in foreign policy circles, preparation and hard work met opportunity and, combined with a keen intellect and strong worldview, created an eventful career in foreign policy.\n\nAfter secondary school at Igbobi College in Lagos and Christ\u2019s School, Ado Ekiti, Akinyemi obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in political science at Temple University in Philadelphia, USA in 1964.\n\nAt the time, America was neck-deep in a Cold War with the communist Soviet Union, the Vietnam War was raging and America\u2019s controversial deployment of its troops to the Asian conflict was becoming a foreign policy quagmire.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act had been passed in quick succession as monumental breakthroughs in political rights for black Americans in the Lyndon Johnson presidency. These events formed a momentous backdrop for a serious African student of the world and the place of his race in it.\n\nHe went on to graduate school at the prestigious Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts, where he obtained the Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy (MALD) in 1966.\n\nThe Fletcher School was founded in 1933 as a joint cooperation between Tufts University and Harvard University. Its powerful network of alumni includes top political leaders, diplomats, intelligence operatives, and heads of multinational business corporations.\n\nIt is a pedigree that opens doors in world capitals. I know. Inspired by Akinyemi\u2019s impact at NIIA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and with his support through a letter of recommendation that helped me win the Joan Gillespie Fellowship, I also took a master\u2019s degree at The Fletcher School in 1992 and joined the United Nations Service immediately afterwards.\n\nMy appointment later in life as a professor on the faculty of The Fletcher School in 2015 after my tenure at the Central Bank of Nigeria was something that gave Akinyemi a lot of pride. More than many, he understood its particular significance.\n\nAkinyemi went on to study at the University of Oxford from 1966 to 1969, bagging a Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil) at the age of 27. He met and later married his wife Rowena Akinyemi, a British citizen.\n\nOn returning to Nigeria and becoming a Lecturer and later Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the University of Ibadan, his television interviews and newspaper articles caught the attention of military officers such as Murtala Mohammed and Ibrahim Babangida. In 1975, when Mohammed became Head of State after the coup that toppled Gen. Yakubu Gowon and pursued a more assertive foreign policy, he tapped Akinyemi for the post of DG of the NIIA.\n\nAs the foreign minister under the military presidency of Gen. Babangida, Akinyemi established the Nigerian Technical Aid Corps scheme that exists to this day. Under the scheme, Nigerian professionals provide technical expertise and manpower to other developing countries.\n\nThis is a more advanced version of the American Peace Corps. It is a classic and practical projection of \u201csoft power\u201d, known to be effective in achieving international influence as an important anchor of bilateral relations between countries.\n\nPerhaps Akinyemi\u2019s most profound conceptual foreign policy initiative was that of the Concert of Medium Powers in world politics, with Nigeria as a key actor in this group of states.\n\nThe concept was that 16 regional powers, countries that, based on economic, diplomatic and other factors in international relations were considered medium powers would act proactively to promote stability and conflict resolution while at the same time serving as an informal counterweight to the dominance of the Great Powers that were and remain permanent members of the UN Security Council.\n\nThe Concert also would serve to project Nigeria as a global power beyond Africa and the struggle against apartheid in South Africa at the time. It would deal with cross-cutting issues. With its initial exploratory meeting held in Lagos in 1987, the Concert, later dubbed the Lagos Forum, was to include countries such as Austria, Brazil, Mexico, India, Malaysia and Sweden.\n\nHowever, perhaps because Akinyemi initiated the Concert of Medium Powers late in his tenure in office, the ambitious idea did not survive his exit from the Babangida cabinet. This was unfortunate.\n\nHad the initiative grown to become fully established, Nigeria would have been better positioned to have become one of the Emerging Market economies (instead of a Frontier Market) that Brazil, Mexico, India and Malaysia indisputably became.\n\nWe would have been better placed to have eventually become part of the BRICS countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, making it BRINKS. And we would perhaps have a seat at the table of the G20 medium economic powers from which we are absent. South Africa is, again, the only African country that is a member. Bolaji Akinyemi saw tomorrow in the context of the world and Nigeria\u2019s potential place in it.\n\nAkinyemi\u2019s contributions in the domestic political arena have also been significant. Through no fault of his, however, Nigeria\u2019s destructive national political culture, which has short-circuited our development, rendered his similarly weighty contributions in this arena stillborn for the most part.\n\nThe forward-looking recommendations of the Uwais panel on electoral reform were never implemented. The momentous report of the National Conference convened by President Jonathan gathers dust in the archives. The \u201cbow-tie diplomat\u201d and \u201cprofessor of significance\u201d as he has been described by commentators, also played a central role in the struggle against the dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha. He was a member of the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, as one of its vocal members in exile.\n\nBolaji Akinyemi remains a sought-after public commentator today, alongside his role as an elder statesman. Smartly, apart from the occasional newspaper interview, he now deploys a mostly visual medium.\n\n\u201cThrough My Eyes\u201d, his video and television series on world affairs, is a must-view for anyone interested in international affairs. From the victory of the Taliban in conflict-ridden Afghanistan to the life and death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, from the role of sports in international relations to the implications of the rise of China as a world power, Akinyemi\u2019s brilliant insights into world affairs do not disappoint.\n\nCan we rediscover and rekindle, on a large scale of public policy, debate and understanding, Akinyemi\u2019s erudite understanding and interpretation of the world? Especially in a time when technology has made the world a truly global village but sovereign imperatives of national interest still reign?\n\nThe age of Covid- and the politics of vaccine production and distribution, as well as travel bans, provide an opportunity for such reflection. In the long line of Nigerian foreign ministers, Bolalji Akinyemi remains a remarkable figure by virtue of the sheer brilliance and influence of his intellect.\n\nI consider him to be more of the realist school of international relations \u2013 the world as it is and how our country can gain competitive advantage, not the world as it ought to be. As the late international relations scholar Hedley Bull who taught at Oxford and my Ph.D. alma mata the London School of Economics argued, we live in an \u201canarchical society\u201d of states.\n\nAkinyemi understood and sought to advance, Nigeria\u2019s destiny as the biggest black-race country in the world. Politics holds the key to Nigeria\u2019s future. Its brokenness in our country wastes the brilliance of many men and women.\n\nWe must therefore return to the leadership of persons with ideas such as Akinyemi. Would that he was as successful in politics as he was in diplomacy. Nigeria would have fared better. But he has led, and is still living, a life in full. Cheers to him @80.\n\nProfessor Moghalu was a presidential candidate in the 2019 elections and is a presidential aspirant for the 2023 elections.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Lekan Balogun tipped as successor as Olubadan dies",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe traditional structure of ascension to the throne of Olubadan ohas been well-arranged such that it is seamless. The chieftaincy system makes the royal succession tradition largely free from rancour, litigation and usurpation. Any male child title-holder of the metropolitan centre of Ibadan is a potential king.\n\nIn Ibadanland, the two ruling lines are the \u2018Egbe Agba\u2019 (civil) and \u2018Balogun\u2019 (military) from where Olubadans are appointed on rotational basis to occupy the stool on the demise of a monarch.\n\nThe two high chiefs that are next in rank to the Olubadan from the two lines are the Otun Olubadan and Balogun of Ibadanland. The duo are recognised as second-class traditional rulers under the Western Nigeria Law.\n\nThe fact that Oba Adetunji was produced by the Balogun Lineage has automatically positioned the Otun Lineage to produce the next Olubadan. And the most senior chief is Senator Lekan Balogun, who was in the Senate for Oyo Central from 1999 to 2003.\n\nSince the news broke that Oba Adetunji has joined his ancestors, it was a sort of mourning of the departed soul at Popoyemoja Compound of the monarch. But at Ali-Iwo Compound of Senator Balogun, it has been jubilation galore that it is time for one of their own to occupy the stool as long as God allows him to live.\n\nIn an interview with Daily Sun in May 2017, Balogun said: \u201cWhen I became Mogaji of Ali Iwo Compound, there were a lot of much older people, whose kids were even older than me. My compound used to produce the oldest person as Mogaji before my time. Yet, these people insisted I should be made Mogaji in the late 1970s. The Olubadan that we have produced so far \u2013 Ali Iwo I, reigned for three months as Olubadan. If I make it to the throne of Olubadan, I will be Ali Iwo II. After I became Mogaji, many young and educated men have been made Mogajis, which is the self reforming nature of the Olubadan chieftaincy system.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun, however, enquired from the Ekefa Olubadan, Oloye Lekan Alabi, how long it usually takes for new Olubadan to be installed after the demise of a monarch. He answered by saying Olubadan-in-Council, which is the body of kingmakers, comprising the 11 High Chiefs and Iyalode of Ibadanland, would meet and decide when a new Olubadan would emerge.\n\nHe explained that the usual practice has always been that the Olubadan-in-Council would meet and commiserate with the bereaved royal family, and would select the successor that is always known. He added that what the council would do would only be ratification of the next in rank to the late occupier of the throne. The council, he said, would then make recommendation to the state government for approval. After the approval, a date would then be set for installation ceremony.\n\nThe Laws of Oyo State of Nigeria 2000 Cap 28 spell out the power of the governor in relation to the appointment of recognised chieftaincies in the state. Irrespective of recommendation from the kingmakers, the laws empower the governor to pick among four most senior chiefs on the line, whose turn it is to produce Olubadan, based on certain parameters, such that the candidate for the throne must not be suffering from any serious physical infirmity, must not be a lunatic and must not be an ex-convict. But no governor in the state has ever changed the ratification made by the Olubadan-in-Council.\n\nIn this instance, the four most senior chiefs on the Otun Line are Senator Balogun as the Otun Olubadan; Senator Rashidi Ladoja, former governor of Oyo State, as Osi Olubadan; Eddy Oyewole as Ashipa Olubadan and Abiodun Kola-Daisi, as Ekerin Olubadan. Every chief on the Otun Line has to ascend 22 steps and every chief on the Balogun Line has to climb 23 steps to occupy the stool. It usually takes decades to groom an Olubadan for the stool through the stages of chieftaincy promotion, which is an average of 35 to 40 years.\n\nJagun is the first step on the two lines that produce Olubadan on rotational basis. But for a chief to become Jagun on either of the two lines, he must have been a \u2018Mogaji\u2019 (compound head) . Mogajis are installed by reigning Olubadan, and there are about 500 mogajis at present.\n\nOlubadan died 2 months to 6th coronation anniversary\n\nOba Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso I, joined his ancestors at the age of 93, barely two months to the celebration of his sixth coronation anniversary, having been crowned on March 4, 2016.\n\nPersonal Assistant/Director of Public Affairs to the late monarch, Mr. Adeola Oloko, said his principal was hospitalised for five days before he joined his ancestors.\n\nIn an interview with journalists in his office at the Popoyemoja palace of Oba Adetunji, yesterday, Oloko said the late paramount ruler was initially hospitalised at a private hospital for five days, before he was rushed to the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, by 9:30pm on Saturday January 1, 2022 for enhanced medical attention.\n\n\u201cIt was a brief illness. At about 9pm on Saturday, he was taken to UCH, Ibadan. After four hours at UCH, which was 1a.m., he joined his ancestors. He was aged 93 years. May God repose his soul.\u201d\n\nOloko, however, cleared the speculation that Oba Adetunji, who celebrated his 93rd birthday in August 2021, died of COVID-19, saying: \u201cOlubadan did not die of COVID-19. If he was infected, his corpse would not be brought to the palace. The scores of sympathisers here would not be allowed into the premises. You journalists would not even come here. So, COVID-19 did not kill him.\u201d\n\nThe remains of the late monarch were conveyed to the palace in an ambulance of the UCH, yesterday morning. However, the Chief Medical Director of UCH, Prof Abiodun Otegbayo, in a statement by Mr. Toye Akinrinlola, deputy director of Information and Public Relations Officer, said Oba Adetunji passed on at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at 1.15 a.m., adding that the late monarch was referred to the UCH from a private hospital in Ibadan at about 9.30 pm on Saturday. He was immediately admitted to the ICU where Prof. Otegbayo directed that a high-powered medical team be constituted to provide the best medical treatment to him.

He was humble, humane, mature, calm and decent, always a symbol of unruffled dignity.\n\n\u201cBefore he mounted the throne, Oba Adetunji had made his name as a successful businessman and music and entertainment promoter who contributed a lot to uplift the careers of many top musicians in the land, thus contributing his quota to the growth of our country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cOn the throne, the late Olubadan worked assiduously for peace and stability of not only Ibadanland, Oyo State and Yorubaland, but also the entire country. He superintended over the ancient city with even-handedness.\u201d\n\nMinister of Youth and Sports Development, Chief Sunday Dare, in his message of condolence, said he had fond recollections of the late Olubadan as a warm, sociable, peaceful and progress loving father who was always interested in the growth and progress of people without minding where they come from.\n\n\u201cI am highly delighted that my path crossed with that of the late Olubadan and I want to say, meeting and having a good relationship him is a thing that I will cherish for the rest of my life.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu , Romanus Ugwu, Godwin Tsa, Abuja, Sola Ojo, Kaduna, Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has been challenged to go beyond \u201cmere rhetoric\u201d and muster political will to end insecurity and immediately restore peace and prosperity across the country.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere and the Arewa Consultative Forum were among groups and individuals who, yesterday, advised the APC-led Federal Government on what to do to bring about peace as the New Year dawns.\n\nSpecifically, the MBF decried the plight of people of the Middle Belt who have continued to suffer severe and persistent attacks from marauding gangs of murderous herdsmen. It said it would no longer tolerate the destruction of communities and unprovoked killings of defenceless citizens.\n\n\u201cThese killings have become the trend in many parts of the Middle Belt region of southern Kaduna, Niger, Plateau, Benue, Adamawa, among others. In Damboa Local Government Area of Southern Borno, Boko Haram elements have completely taken over the LGA in the past three years without any challenge from security personnel. It is from Damboa LGA that Boko Haram launches attacks on communities, including the recent attack that killed a military general. Allowing the terrorist organisation to mount roadblocks in any part of Nigeria amounts to telling the world that there are two sovereignties in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the New Year, we call on President Muhammadu Buhari to send a clear message to the security forces to defeat Boko Haram and throw them out of Damboa LGA. The destruction of our communities and the unprovoked killings of defenceless citizens can no longer be tolerated. When innocent and vulnerable people are left unprotected from the terror of criminals, there can be no option left than self-defence,\u201d Its National President, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, in a statement, yesterday.\n\nThe forum called on relevant security agencies not to relent in cleansing the Middle Belt communities of terrorists who take pleasure in kidnapping, destroying communities and dislocating people. It said the continuous wielding of arms by criminals in daylight to intimidate locals must be stopped in order to protect communities and not force then to embrace self-defence.\n\n\u201cWe do not need a prophet to warn us of the dire consequences of what this massive displacement of our farming population holds for our people. In the face of these severe attacks that have not attracted commensurate responses from the security personnel, we call on security agencies to smoke out these murderous bandits from their holes and bring them to justice. As an umbrella organisation of ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt Region, we call on President Buhari to swiftly order the security agencies to stop the human carnage ripping across Nigeria, especially in the Middle Belt.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze\u2019s message on how to restore sanity in the country, according to its National Publicity Secretary, Alex Chiedozie Ogbonna, is in two forms.\n\n\u201cFirst, he should ask himself a question on how he wants to be remembered when he leaves office; second, he should do to the South East what Obasanjo did to the North West when he said it was their turn to produce the president.\n\n\u201cHe should also say it is the turn of the Igbo to produce the president of Nigeria and with it, there will be peace in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ogbonna also identified poverty and injustice as Nigerians\u2019 major problems, stressing that if President Buhari supports a president from Igboland, he would have solved the problem of injustice because such a move would amount to justice.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said the Buhari administration must use this year and the remaining part of 2023 before its tenure expires to right the wrongs that have occurred since it came to power.\n\n\u201cThe administration must step up efforts in two specific areas \u2013 security and the economy. Various parts of the country are experiencing unprecedented insecurity. Kidnapping in the manner we have never had it is rampant everywhere. The welfare of Nigerians has gone down so low.\n\n\u201cThe president must ensure the security agencies are empowered to secure Nigerians. It should no longer be a matter of \u2018we are on top of the situation.\u2019 So far, the issue of security has been mere rhetoric and that is why kidnappers and those claiming territory are having a field day. It is not acceptable and the government must do something about it. The government has to give these people an ultimatum to lay down their weapons, and if they refuse, the government should be able to deal appropriately with them.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary-General of ACF, Anthony NZ Sani, said unless and until the Nigerian elite come together to be a part of the solution, Nigeria\u2019s problems would persist as no president can address it alone.\n\nHe disagreed with Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, on communities bearing arms to defend themselves against bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\n\u201cAllowing communities to bear arms may not be helpful because even America which is 245 years old is grappling to roll back the law that allows citizens free access to arms that has turned out not to be a blessing but a curse that kills Americans every year.\n\n\u201cA developing Nigeria cannot afford such a situation. It is better to have enough and well trained and equipped security personnel who are motivated to secure the nation\u201d, he noted.\n\nSolution to insecurity must dominate APC Natl convention \u2013 Govs DG\n\nDirector-General of the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr Salihu Lukman, challenged leaders of the party to prioritise finding solutions to security challenges at its February national convention.\n\nLukman in a statement titled: \u201cIssues for successful APC National Convention\u201d said: \u201cAs a party preparing for its national convention in February 2022, we must appeal to APC leaders to include debate about what needs to be done by all APC government to mobilise the support of Nigerians to bring to an immediate end the current national security challenge in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a party, APC needs to do everything necessary to refocus national debates towards strengthening the initiatives of President Buhari-led government to produce the desired outcome of securing the country. Strengthening the capacity of APC-led Federal Government to produce the desired outcome, in the short run is about massive recruitment of police and military personnel in the country, in addition to the investment that has been made towards procurement of arms, including the A-29 Tucano jets. In the long run, it is about providing good conditions of service and sustainable funding framework for the operation of police and security services in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "*Blames anomaly on weak internal control system at Force Headquarters\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Office of the Auditor General for the Federation (OAuGF) has disclosed that about 178,459 different types of arms and ammunition got missing from the Nigeria Police armoury in 2019, without any trace or formal report on their whereabouts. Of the figure, 88,078 were AK-47 rifles and 3,907 assorted rifles and pistols from different formations nationwide. These could not be accounted for as at January 2020.\n\nDetails of the missing arms were contained on pages 383 to 391 of the Auditor General for the Federation\u2019s annual report on non-compliance, internal control weaknesses issues in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government of Nigeria for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was submitted to the National Assembly.\n\nReferenced AuGF/AR.2019/02, the report seen by THISDAY at the weekend, was dated September 15, 2021, signed by the Auditor General for the Federation, Adolphus Aghughu, and addressed to the Clerk to the National Assembly.\n\nThe report accused the Nigeria Police headquarters of lacking comprehensive details of unserviceable weapons, lamenting that such could fall into unauthorised hands for illegal use. It stated that the action of the Nigeria Police contravened paragraph 2603 of the Financial Regulations, which stipulates that in the event of any loss of stores, the officer in charge of the store in which the loss occur shall report immediately to the head of department or unit but not later than three days, by the fastest means possible if the loss occurs away from headquarters.\n\nThe AuGF report stated, \u201cAudit observed from the review of Arms Movement Register, Monthly Returns of Arms and Ammunition and Ammunition Register at the Armoury section that a total number of lost firearms as reported as at December 2018 stood at 178,459 pieces.\n\n\u201cOut of this number, 88,078 were AK-47 rifles, 3,907 assorted rifles and pistols across different police formations, which could not be accounted for as at January 2020.

          "text": "\u00b7 Seek removal of impediments to doing business in Nigeria\n\n\u00b7 Want government to prioritise forex allocation to manufacturers\n\nDike Onwuamaeze\n\nMembers of the organised private sector (OPS) have advised the federal government to make deliberate efforts to remove impediments to the conduct of business in the country in 2022, especially with respect to clearing of goods at the ports, stressing that its war clearing goods at the country\u2019s seaports.\n\nAlso, following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s promise to improve foreign exchange (FX) supply to manufacturers this year, the OPS members also appealed to the federal government to remove other hindrances to manufacturing.\n\nIn addition, they supported recent call by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, to strip the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) of the responsibility of revenue collection and generation.\n\nThe OPS advised the federal government to direct efforts toward accelerated industrialisation for the Nigerian economy in 2022.\n\nThe leaders of the real sector spoke in separate chats with THISDAY. They noted that removing hindrances to the activities of manufacturers and other key players in the country\u2019s real sector would enhance productivity, especially as Africa prepares to fully implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSome of the major constraints they asked the government to address included low FX supply and poor electricity to the real sector, challenges at the country\u2019s seaports, and low patronage of made in Nigeria goods.\n\nPresident of the Nigerian Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Taiwo Adeniyi, told THISDAY it was important for government to do everything possible to remove all impediments to industrialisation. Adeniyi said NCS should be freed from the task of being a revenue-generating agency of government.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is important that government should pay attention to industrialisation and do everything possible to remove all the impediments affecting ability do business in this country, like the issue around our ports.\n\n\u201cEven when you struggle to bring in materials, it is war at the port to get them out. The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) is always like never wishing us to clear our goods at a time meant for them to be cleared.\n\n\u201cWe are also calling on the government to begin to consider seriously making customs a non-revenue generating agency. As long as it remains a revenue-generating agency with a target to meet, the NCS will not do its work professionally. Moreover, the NCS should be audited and published.\u201d\n\nAdeniyi also advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to fashion out strategy to support manufacturers in the country with improved access to forex.\n\nHe stated, \u201cYes, the president has made a promise to us. But it will remain a promise until it is implemented. What we are pleading is this: let the government prioritise manufacturers in the allocation of the little forex at its disposal.\n\n\u201cIn fairness, the government has been giving us special financing windows. But these windows are in naira. We cannot use naira to buy machines that we need to expand our operation. Most businesses that benefited from these funding were not able to use them because there was no forex.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Director General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, advised the CBN to expedite the process of unifying exchange rates in the various forex windows in the country. Ajayi-Kadir said stakeholders from the private sector should be nominated to monitor the disbursement of forex by commercial banks to ensure transparent and timeous allocation to bona fide manufacturers.\n\nHe also highlighted the need for government to take steps to relieve manufacturers of the burden of spending over N73 billion annually to provide alternative energy.\n\nAjayi-Kadir said, \u201cSo the immediate step to take in 2022 is for Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to remove all the bottlenecks inhibiting manufacturers\u2019 access to the 2,000 megawatts of stranded electricity, as envisaged under the Eligible Customer Scheme.\n\n\u201cOther measures would include up-scaling efforts at further development of electricity value-chain.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cMinistries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of government should compulsorily and strictly prioritise the patronage of made in Nigeria items in all their purchases and contracts. For instance, local manufacturers of LPG gas cylinders are specifically designated as priority providers of the 10 million cooking gas cylinders to be procured by the federal government for 12 states in the federation.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that the looming increases in excise and tax rates, especially for carbonated non-alcoholic drinks, dairy products, should be discountenanced, arguing that the manufacturing sector would not be able to accommodate any form of increase.\n\nThe MAN director general added, \u201cAs we approach the actual commencement of trading under the AfCFTA, the government should intentionally support manufacturing by creating the enabling environment, providing trade information through the commercial desks of Nigerian embassies in African countries, and up-scaling the involvement of the private sector in negotiations and implementation processes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Director General of the Nigerian Association of Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, \u201cThe effective implementation of the 2022 Appropriation Act for inclusive economic growth and development should be a top priority. The real challenge is to see how the budget, which has been tagged \u2018Budget of Growth and Sustainability,\u2019 will positively impact the lives of the people and various sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that budget 2022 makes a significant impact on the energy sector if it is to be meaningful and be a budget of growth and sustainability.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for The Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, urged the government to untangle the cargo clearing processes at ports by reducing the number of agencies involved. Yusuf also canvassed the deployment of technology to aid the customs clearing process.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe use of the scanner is particularly very important. It is a sad commentary that the largest economy in Africa has been examining cargoes and containers physically and manually for the past few years. The effect of this on the cost of imports has been humongous.\n\n\u201cThe interest payment on the import, demurrage charges arising from delays, the extra charges by shipping companies, the additional charges by the truck drivers, all of these have put a lot of burden on cost on investors and citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Cost of borrowing in global commodity industry to surge in 2022\n\n*Despite headwinds, Wood Mackenzie predicts over $400bn global spending\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s desire to continue reaping the benefits of its oil and gas resources before the world fully embraces renewables may face serious headwinds this year, with the global finance community tying up over $130 trillion capital to funding carbon-free energy investments.\n\nThis means that funds available for lending to International Oil Companies (IOCs), and by extension the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited which acts as their Joint Venture (JV) partners could be severely curtailed.\n\nNigeria has continued to struggle to ramp up its production volume in the upstream of the country\u2019s oil and gas industry, but had largely failed due to years of under-investment, ageing infrastructure and inability to procure modern equipment to deter incessant oil theft and sabotage.\n\nThe much-needed investment would also enable operators adopt artificial intelligence systems as well as deploy virtual and machine learning in exploration and production.\n\nIn August last year, the country enacted the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which was expected to stimulate necessary investments in the industry, but that dream appears to be under threat as global financing organisations continue to withdraw funding for fossils in preference for renewable sources of energy.\n\nIn its latest report, Wood Mackenzie, a global energy, research and consultancy group, noted that though the oil and gas sector would continue its rally in 2022, the positive outlook was tempered by concerns about the future of the industry.\n\nIn its oil and gas outlook for 2022, Wood Mackenzie predicted that record cash flows would come under increasing scrutiny as operators would begin to align with their pledges on decarbonisation.\n\nIt further projected that the existing cracks in the fragile service sector would widen and explorers will keep options open for the energy transition.\n\nThrough the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), over $130 trillion of private capital have now been committed to net zero from over 450 firms across 45 countries.\n\nIn its progress report published recently, GFANZ had announced that financial sector commitments to net zero exceeded $130 trillion, a 25-fold increase in the last few years.\n\nThe global funding organisations are committing more funds to renewables include banks, insurers, pension funds, asset managers, export credit agencies and stock exchanges as well as credit rating agencies, index providers and audit firms.\n\n\u201cFinancing oil and gas was getting harder before COP26, but the pressure will ratchet up in 2022. Institutions with over US$130 trillion of capital under management have joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.\n\n\u201c(As we) watch for the pool of backers to shrink, borrowing costs will increase, and project financing for oil will get harder,\u201d the renowned research firm stated.\n\nDespite the upsides for this year, Wood Mackenzie stated that for many stakeholders and even some CEOs, the sector\u2019s risks outweigh the gains, stressing that \u201cthis tension will define 2022.\u201d\n\nAs a follow-up from COP26, the research firm projected that more radical moves to downsize oil and gas will take place, but however noted that, \u201copportunists\u201d could take up the slack and spend more on development and acquisitions.\n\nIt stressed that while lending would not dry up immediately, demand recovery could be halted by new global headwinds including additional Covid-19 variants, derailing prices and the promised wall of cash from upstream.\n\nStressing that oil and gas reinvestment rates remained critical to meeting demand, Wood Mackenzie made a forecast that with capital discipline prevailing, the industry could experience a 9 per cent increase in investment compared to last year.\n\n\u201cA nine per cent year-on-year increase will take spend over $400 billion again in 2022. Despite this, at 40 per cent, the global reinvestment rate will remain near record lows at our forecast price,\u201d it pointed.\n\nAccording to the firm, the focus would be on advantaged barrels, low-breakeven projects and low-carbon deepwater projects, which it noted will dominate greenfield Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).\n\nIt added that most operators would hesitate to sanction projects without short payback periods and low emissions, while companies would allocate more capital to upstream decarbonisation.\n\nIncreased transparency and emissions benchmarking reporting, it said, would put pressure on upstream players, increasing action on decarbonisation.\n\nThe firm noted that while 2021 was a big year for upstream Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), 2022 would be bigger as the world continues its push for cleaner sources of fuel.\n\nIt stated that conventional exploration would follow the disciplined path set in 2021, despite improved prices, forecasting that spend will total $20-$25 billion, led by the oil majors and larger National Oil Companies (NOCs).\n\n\u201cIn 2022, more governments might join those with exploration bans. But they are unlikely to include basins holding substantial prospective resources. Of more concern is the possibility that the development of new discoveries may be prohibited,\u201d Wood Mackenzie noted.\n\nAt a projected 1.86 million barrels daily oil production in the country\u2019s 2021 budget, Nigeria recorded a huge deficit of almost 200 million barrels of the liquid in the first 11 months of last year.\n\nNow unable to meet its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production allocation for months and with just 12 out of the country\u2019s 53 oil rigs currently active, the oil and gas sector desperately requires huge inflow of these investments to help accelerate the pumping of more oil.\n\nChief Executive Officer, NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, who recently attributed the declining production to theft, insecurity, aging facilities, decline in exploration and production enhancement initiatives, noted that Nigeria was aspiring to increase its reserves to 40 billion barrels and raise production to three million barrels per day.\n\nFigures from the NURPC obtained by THISDAY last week indicated that while Nigeria was expected to pump approximately 635 million barrels of oil by November 2021, it only struggled to produce 441 million barrels for the entire period.\n\nAlthough OPEC expects Nigeria to produce 1.683 million bpd in January 2022, meeting that target would be an uphill task as the country has maintained an average of 1.25 million barrels in the last few months.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Yes, we\u2019re grateful for the respite of the public holiday, but you\u2019re probably working yourself into that mental space to resume work for the year.\n\nSince 2015, every New Year has seen Techpoint celebrate its birthday. On January 1, 2022, Techpoint turned 7, and we\u2019re entering the next frontier. Check out what that means in our Chief Servant, Muyiwa Matuluko\u2019s new year address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Africa is 7! The next frontier\n\nWhat I\u2019m discussing\n\nA momentous 2021\n\nSignificant regulatory moves to watch closely\n\nIndustry trends for 2022\n\nA momentous 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was an incredible year for Africa\u2019s tech space in 2021, which saw five startups publicly disclose their valuations as unicorns. Led by Flutterwave in March 2021, OPay, Wave, Andela, and Chipper Cash joined the enviable ranks of companies worth over a billion dollars.\n\nThe acquisition of Funke-Opeke led MainOne by Equinix for $320 million remains one of the standout moments. Don\u2019t forget Nigeria\u2019s shocking 2021.\n\nWe did a roundup of the memorable moments of 2021. Check it out here.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the industry that stood out heads, shoulders, and knees above the pack was the fintech space. Nigerian fintechs, for example, raised almost $800 million in 2021, gulped up 76% of funding for the year.\n\nBut the real impact of fintech is not in the funding numbers, and in the last year, we saw some intriguing moves in agency banking, telco led mobile money, and e-transactions.\n\nGuided by the expert opinion of Adedeji Olowe, Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria, we reviewed Nigerian fintech in the year 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReviewing Nigerian fintech in 2021: Local investors are stepping up\n\nAre you interested in projections for the new year? Kindly keep reading.\n\nPolicies I\u2019m watching out for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana debating e-payment levies\n\nOn December 21, 2021, Ghana\u2019s parliament turned into a legitimate battleground as lawmakers debated a proposal to introduce a 1.75% levy on all e-payment transactions. This would include mobile money transactions.\n\nThose in support are eyeing dividends of up to $1.15 billion that the country would gain in 2022 if its tax net widens to include e-payments.\n\nThose against the bill insist that it wouldn\u2019t be fair on low-income earners and people outside the formal banking sector, who heavily rely on mobile money.\n\nContext: In recent years, mobile money adoption in Ghana has been growing in leaps and bounds to rival Kenya\u2019s success story. A levy on mobile money transactions would improve taxation revenues, but there\u2019s no telling how it would impact the average mobile money user.\n\nThe parliament will meet on January 18, 2022, to cast the final votes, so that\u2019s a space worth watching.\n\nKenya signs law on digital lending\n\nWith banks reluctant to give loans, Africa has seen the rise of several digital lenders who have filled this gap. However, there\u2019s been a few controversies regarding unethical and predatory lending practices.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the Kenyan government has been implementing policies to stem these predatory practices. On December 7, 2021, the Kenyan parliament amended the Central Bank Act, 2021, giving the Central Bank of Kenya the authority to regulate digital credit lenders and limit unfair and discriminatory lending practices.\n\nGiven how vital lending is (more on that in a bit), I think this is a policy worth watching, and we can track important metrics like micro-lending activities. Read more.\n\nFunding Nigerian digital and creative companies\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a $170 million loan to fund the Nigerian Federal Government\u2019s i-DICE (investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises) program.\n\nThe government plans to use this initiative to fund 226 technology and creative startups and provide non-financial services to 451 digital technology and small and medium enterprises.\n\nNigeria\u2019s policy space has been fraught with lots of bad news, but I thought I should bring up what seems like good news.\n\nThe problem is, we\u2019ve seen several initiatives like this, and I\u2019ve been dismissive of them, but I think I should pay closer attention to announcements like these.\n\nYes, we\u2019ll look at past promises of such nature too, and if time permits, we can also include the one about lifting Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nThe CBN\n\nI\u2019m not saying the Central Bank of Nigeria is a policy to watch out for; I\u2019m simply saying we should pay them close attention. Whatever the apex bank decides tomorrow could heavily affect Nigeria\u2019s fintech space.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\nThankfully, the Nigerian Federal Executive Council has okayed the startup bill, and it has been sent to the National Assembly. If passed, this bill is touted as one of the most important legislation for Nigeria\u2019s tech space.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has a stellar history of passing great business laws, but implementing them has been another issue. Can we see a change in 2022? Does Nigeria need a startup act? Where are the clouds and silver linings?\n\nHere\u2019s my analysis on this subject. Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nSome projections for 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet is the lifeblood of the world\u2019s biggest companies today, so imagine my surprise in 2021 when I discovered the term Web3.\n\nThe Internet has evolved from different stages, with the original invention being called web 1, our current era is web2, and the future evolution will be Blockchain-powered Web3.\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no industry trend without the Internet, so what happens to all the companies we know and appreciate if the Internet is changing? What does this evolution mean, and how does it affect me? We had some answers in the last crypto explorer of 2021.\n\nWeb3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond\n\nSurprise: Cloudfare says TIKTOK is now the most visited site in the world. Really? Not Google?\n\nWell, now is probably a good time to secure your child\u2019s online activities.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Web2? In 2021, several startups raised money to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector, undoubtedly the largest employer of labour on the continent and its most significant economic contributor.\n\nAs a result, these startups could experience closer scrutiny in 2022, with great expectations on their shoulders; it promises to be an exciting ride.\n\nAnother company that will be sure to make the headlines is Jumia. Long before the new wave of startups, Jumia dealt with African SMEs, and its struggles are well documented. Could we see a change in 2022?\n\nFintech ride: In 2021, Nigeria processed 3 billion electronic transactions valued at $588 billion. Source: I nor fit lie f\u2026 sorry.. NIBSS.\n\nI\u2019m making it one of my projects in 2022 to find out what all those transactions are. My best guess is cash, but is that the whole story?\n\nAlso, in 2021, Nigerian fintech, Piggyvest, said it disbursed $587.5 million to 3.5 million customers.\n\nMeanwhile, Olowe has again made some exciting predictions for Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\nSeveral predictions from last year, like WhatsApp\u2019s payment play and Visa and MasterCard\u2019s acquisition of Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively, have also featured in 2022.\n\nHighlights\n\nP2P FX to power investment apps\n\nNIN dethrones BVN\n\nTransfers become free.\n\nWe\u2019ll do a review this week, but you can check out his predictions here in the meantime\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nWishing you a Happy New Year!\n\nEmmanuel Paul for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup scene has seen continued progress year on year. After a slight setback in 2020, courtesy of the coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown, activities have resumed as usual \u2014 well, almost.\n\nAs the year ends, we bring you a few memorable moments across the African tech ecosystem, some good and some bad.\n\nMore African investors throw their hats in the ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKola Aina, pioneer founder Ventures Platform fund\n\nFor so long, most of the investment into African startups came from foreign investors. Make no mistake, that is still the case. However, more African investors are springing up and providing much-needed funding for African startups.\n\nThis year saw PiggyVest\u2019s Co-founder, Odunayo Eweniyi team up with Eloho Omame to start FirstCheck, an African firm funding startups founded by women. Seasoned investor and early PiggyVest investor, Olumide Soyombo, launched Voltron Capital; LoftyInc Capital launched its third fund of $10 million. Ventures Platform recently announced the first close of its $40 million fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany founders also invested in startups themselves or as part of a collective, with Flutterwave\u2019s Founder, Olugbenga Agboola; Paystack\u2019s Co-founders, Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi; and Babs Ogundeyi, Founder and CEO of Kuda Bank some of the founders to do so.\n\nAll this points to a better understanding of the dynamics of funding tech startups by local investors and would help support more innovators on the continent. We\u2019re excited to see how this plays out.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crypto ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a broken payment infrastructure, many Nigerians took to cryptocurrencies to navigate global financial systems.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government of Nigeria was having none of it. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria, it issued a circular in February instructing commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions to stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\nThere was a brief period when it seemed users of cryptocurrencies were going to capitulate, but they were only regrouping with peer to peer transactions increasing as a result.\n\nThe year of the unicorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nAs the year started, Africa had only one unicorn. As of December, it now boasts five fintech startups as OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and talent outsourcing company, Andela, joined Interswitch as the continent\u2019s unicorns.\n\nFlutterwave led the way when it raised $170 million in a Series C round in March, bringing its total funding to $225 million.\n\nOPay was the next with a $400 million raise that took its valuation way past the $1 billion mark and made it the fastest African startup to cross the $1 billion valuation mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy September, Andela became the latest unicorn after Softbank led a $200 million Series E round in the talent outsourcing startup. Chipper Cash rounded up the list as Africa\u2019s seventh unicorn raising a $150 million extension round. This followed its $100 million Series C raise in May.\n\nTwitter\u2019s first African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nNigeria\u2019s frequent fight with Ghana continued this year, and this time, it was not over who had the better jollof rice but over Twitter\u2019s decision to set up its first African office in Ghana.\n\nThe decision to set up in Ghana was a surprise to many after comments made by Twitter\u2019s then CTO (now CEO), Parag Agrawal, during a 2019 visit to Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Agrawal commented on the availability of technical talents in Nigeria and impactful public conversations.\n\nThe roles it began hiring for also indicate that the plan might have been to set up in Nigeria with the company listing free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet as its reasons for choosing Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nBuilding a startup in Nigeria means occasionally pulling all-nighters as you try to figure out how to surmount the latest regulatory hurdle. For so long, it has been argued that Nigerian startup founders need to be proactive in their interactions with the government and regulators.\n\nAs a result, some of the country\u2019s most prominent founders and investors came together to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill. The Bill seeks to set a framework of interaction between the Nigerian startup community and the government to enable startups to thrive.\n\nHowever, this is not the first of such initiatives, and few people expressed scepticism about it. However, it seems plans are on track, with TechCabal reporting that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the bill.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether things work better this time around, but we hope they do.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 2, 2021, microblogging platform, Twitter, deleted tweets made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Twitter, the decision resulted from the President\u2019s violation of its abusive behaviour policy.\n\nTwo days later, on June 4, 2021, the federal government responded by banning the use of the microblogging platform in Nigeria, forcing Nigerians to access Twitter using VPNs. Over the next few months, the federal government disclosed a willingness to lift the ban, provided Twitter agreed to some conditions.\n\nIn August, the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, hinted that the ban would be lifted \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d It\u2019s been over four months now, and the ban is still in place.\n\nFrancophone Africa gets its first unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this year, all of Africa\u2019s tech unicorns had been founded in predominantly English speaking countries. But in September, Wave broke that monopoly, becoming the first francophone Africa unicorn. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it came from the fintech sector.\n\nThe startup became a unicorn after it raised $200 million in Africa\u2019s largest Series A round to date. Founded by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, Wave launched in Senegal in 2017, offering free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application while charging users a 1% fee for money transfers.\n\nIts low-cost solution has enabled it to take on more established players in Senegal, with Orange, the country\u2019s largest mobile money operator, reportedly going as far as stopping its Senegalese users from purchasing Orange airtime using Wave\u2019s application.\n\nRecord-breaking rounds for Egyptian startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was the year of Egyptian startups. Last year, startups in the country raised $156 million, but by August 2021, they had eclipsed those figures. As of September, startups in the country had raised over $400 million in 2021.\n\nConsequently, it now rivals Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as the continents top investment destinations.\n\nAlready, the country has one startup valued above $1 billion in Fawry and could have two when Swvl lists publicly. According to Disrupt Africa\u2019s Egyptian Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, this year, Egypt is behind only Nigeria in terms of funding raised by its startups. However, unlike most startup powerhouses on the continent, Egypt\u2019s most prominent startups are in eCommerce instead of fintech.\n\nMainOne\u2019s impending acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunke Opeke. Founder/CEO, MainOne\n\nLast year, telecommunications service provider, MainOne, celebrated its 10th anniversary. This year, reports have emerged that the company is in talks to be acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nIt is fair to say that the news was one few, if any, were expecting as Nigerians made their feelings known on Twitter. A central talking point was the rumoured cost of the transaction, with some of the opinion that the company was underpriced.\n\nHowever, Funke Opeke, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, quashed such suggestions in an interview with TechCrunch. According to her, while MainOne has raised money since its founding, not all of it has been equity raises, with the company also raising debt rounds.\n\nAt $320 million, this is the highest any Nigerian tech company has acquired. Throw in the fact that this is a female-led company, and you can see how impressive it is.\n\nNigeria\u2019s surprising 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s road to getting 5G has thrown up some surprises, but none has been more surprising than one of the recently concluded 5G auction winners \u2014 MAFAB Communications.\n\nUntil the bids were announced, very little was known about MAFAB Communications or its operations. However, it surprisingly beat Airtel to become one of two holders of Nigeria\u2019s 5G licence. For context, the company was only incorporated on July 8, 2020, but managed to edge out older and more established players.\n\nAs we step into the new year, we do so with excitement at what is to come, and we hope you had an amazing year.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Loan apps defy Google, Nigeria\u2019s data and cyber laws to humiliate defaulters",
          "text": "The ability of securing loans within minutes just after a few clicks in a mobile app, and particularly without collateral made loan apps a darling of many people. What the borrowers did not know, however, was that the hundreds or thousands of contacts (as the case may be) on their mobile phones, was the ultimate collateral. The numbers stored on their phones and accessed by the loan apps, were the lenders\u2019 insurance against any inability to repay. In essence, their reputation and dignity or whatever was to be left of it was to be used in guaranteeing repayment of loans from N5,000 to N100,000 ( $12 to $240).\n\nIt could be a business partner, customer, or even love interest and hundreds of other people a person would not want to get humiliated in their presence, but this, was the ultimate card the loan apps counted on to get paid.\n\n\u201cIt is not a good experience,\u201d said Jane, who defaulted on a loan. After the lender reached out to her phone contacts, to console herself, she said in a mixture of Pidgin and English; \u201cWho no dey borrow? Even Nigeria dey borrow, it is a normal thing. But they should have focused on me paying their money and not reaching out to my contacts.\u201d While she may have been humiliated beyond her imaginations, the psychological impact was a feeling of nothing else to lose.\n\n\u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d as may be recalled by Game of Thrones fans, was the chant as Cersei, the Queen Mother, was paraded through the fictional town of King\u2019s Landing, as atonement for her \u2018sins\u2019. The same can be replayed, when hundreds or thousands of numbers on a person\u2019s phone are contacted, all in a bid to shame a borrower into loan repayment.\n\nRead Also:Loan apps or loan sharks: How digital lending apps trap the poor\n\n\u201cChristmas is over, if you know you borrowed money from any loan App, biko (i.e. please) go and pay back. I don\u2019t want to receive unnecessary messages because of you. Walahi, I go carry them come your house,\u201d wrote Collins Nnabuife on his Facebook page, intended as a joke but also a portrayal of the current reality many live through. Not only for those who have borrowed, but their phone contacts who are harassed with threatening messages, even when they were never used as guarantors for the loan.\n\nThe post by Collins was not unconnected to messages he had received, including one about a female acquaintance, which among other things read; \u201cThis is to inform the general public that Miss Jane Doe (real name withheld) with phone number: 00000000 is a thief and dubious criminal currently on the run with companys (sic) money. She has been declining and avoiding company calls to pay back.\n\n\u201cKindly notify her on getting this notice, as pictures of her will be posted on social media platforms today for criminal act and BVN number blacklisted on failure to pay back today. We will submit her relevant details publicly and treat as fraud.\u201d\n\nSome of the loan apps that have been reported to indulge in similar acts include; 9Credit, NairaPlus, Lcredit, NewCredit, ncash, Kash Kash, iCoin, xCredit, Mint, and Soko Loan, which was recently fined N10 million following petitions by aggrieved users.\n\nWhile the apps mostly claim the lowest loan tenor is 91 days, in order to \u2018pass\u2019 Google playstore requirement for the apps to be hosted, all as recounted by \u2018victims\u2019, actually offer loans from seven days.\n\n\u201cWe do not allow apps that promote personal loans which require repayment in full in 60 days or less from the date the loan is issued,\u201d states Google on a web page on conditions for Financial Services apps. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow apps that expose users to deceptive or harmful financial products and services,\u201d it also says.\n\nChristmas is over, if you know you borrowed money from any loan App, biko (i.e. please) go and pay back. I don\u2019t want to receive unnecessary messages because of you\n\nLoan apps are required to indicate minimum and maximum period of repayment, maximum annual percentage rate, and other information, which most either misrepresent or omit. In particular, by offering loans of just seven days, for instance, these providers clearly flout a major criterion by Google that no tenor should be less than 60 days.\n\n\u201cI was broke then and under pressure to settle certain things,\u201d said Chidi, who borrowed N10,000 each from three of such apps in mid-2021, a total of N30,000 ($72) but defaulted after the 2-week tenor. This led to a tsunami of messages and calls, first to threaten him to repay, then to all his phone contacts. He identified iCoin as one of the apps but couldn\u2019t recollect the others when interviewed.\n\nThe amount a person is eligible to borrow is determined by the work they do and income. Also, when a person borrows and pays back, it qualifies them for another (higher) loan.\n\nThis was the strategy employed by Jane (mentioned earlier), who borrowed an initial N10,000, and repaid so she could be eligible for a higher amount of N20,000, on which she later defaulted. She told BusinessDay there was a sick relative in her care and there was no other person to provide money urgently needed the day she took the first loan. Someone she asked for help had recommended as app she called \u2018Mint\u2019.\n\nTo prevent defaulting on the payment after the one-week tenor, she borrowed from another person, used their money to pay the loan app, which qualified her for another loan. She would then take the second loan, this time N20,000 out of which she repaid the person.\n\nThe second loan was the source of her humiliation, but, curiously, after she had been thoroughly embarrassed, she now appears indifferent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried anymore. After all, they already did their worst by sending out messages to all my contacts,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAs they sent out messages to my contacts, I told them as punishment, I will not repay till after the Christmas and New Year festivities.\u201d\n\nA Google spokesperson, when asked for the company\u2019s reaction to conducts of loan apps hosted on playstore, told BusinessDay the company has very strict policies that guide apps that are allowed on the Playstore platform. \u201cWhen we find violations, we take very strong actions, including sometimes taking down the app from our platform. Violations can be reported by clicking the \u2018Flag as inappropriate\u2019 link under the menu on the Google Play store. When reports are received, We investigate, and take clear actions,\u201d Google said.\n\nApart from violating the terms by Google playstore, the loan apps have also been alleged to contravene Nigeria\u2019s data privacy law on one hand, and cyber security law on the other.\n\nWhen Soko loan, one of the loan apps was fined N10 million by NITDA, it was hinged on complaints by users who accused it of breaching their privacy and defaming them by reaching out to their phone contacts.\n\n\u201cThis action was taken after receiving series of complaints against the company for unauthorised disclosures, failure to protect customers\u2019 personal data and defamation of character as well as carrying out the necessary due diligence as enshrined in the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation,\u201d NITDA said in August, 2021. Months later, the action taken against Soko loan has not deterred other loan apps from similar practices.\n\nHowever, an August 2021 publication on the legality of the fine imposed by NITDA on Soko loans, by Aluko & Oyebode, a law firm, suggested the decision may be flawed, citing some other cases. But the question remains, what can be done and who will rein in the excesses of the loan providers many now refer to as unethical loan sharks.\n\n\u201cAs for the \u2018loan defaulters\u2019, whether their right to privacy has been breached depends on the terms and conditions they agreed upon before the loan or facility was given out. If you agreed for the lender to have access to your contacts in the event of default, I see no reason why you should complain,\u201d was the view of Olaitan Akinnubi, a Lagos-based lawyer.\n\nHe however said, \u201cWhere I think the lenders go too far, is sending unsolicited messages to \u2018innocent\u2019 contacts who they have no business or relationship with. This, in my opinion is an invasion of privacy.\u201d\n\nAn example of such messages sent to Akinnubi by Xcredit, read; A chronic thief and fraudster, \u2026\u2026\u2026, of \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 street, Lagos, (phone number), used you as an emergency contact and has absconded with the company\u2019s money. Inform him to pay back now else he would be arrested and you would be implicated and sanctioned.\n\n\u201cAssociating me with an alleged \u2018chronic thief and fraudster\u2019 and also threatening to \u2018implicate and sanction\u2019 me constitutes an harassment or what you can say is cyber bullying,\u201d according to him.\n\nHe further explained that section 24 (1) (b) of the Cybercrimes Act 2015 provides thus: \u201cAny person who knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter by means of computer systems or network that he knows to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent: commits an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not more than N7,000,000.00 or imprisonment for a term of not more than 3 years or to both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nRecently, it was announced that a joint committee comprising the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), will be working to tackle violation of consumer rights in the money lending industry, with a view to shutting down illegal businesses.\n\nIt is yet to be seen how this committee will ensure loan apps continue operating, without abusing the privacy of users. More so, if violated users will take steps to seek redress, at the very least, reporting the apps to Google for sanctions.",

          "text": "The small South American oil producer Guyana is working hard not to replicate the mistakes made by Nigeria and other African oil producers who failed to set up rainy day funds in the face of booming oil prices.\n\nThe parliament of Guyana voted last week to amend its Natural Resources Fund (NRF) Act that will govern a sovereign wealth fund to create a fund that will manage oil proceeds.\n\nGuyana where more than 10 billion barrels of oil equivalents have been discovered over the past half-decade, had seen its oil sector dominated by oil major ExxonMobil and other American producers the influx of cash that often blinds countries to sensible reforms.\n\nGuyana has also passed a local content bill that requires foreign oil companies to engage the country\u2019s citizens in their operations, especially in a non-technical capacity.\n\nRead more OPEC+ likely to stick with scheduled Feb output increase, sources say\n\nAfrican countries like Nigeria and Angola have achieved notoriety for squandering their oil proceeds on frivolous spending and rampant corruption. This has given rise to rampant poverty in the midst of stunning wealth.\n\nThe Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives (NIETI), has consistently warned that constant oil price volatility exposes oil-dependent countries like Nigeria to regular economic crises.\n\nOne way to address this limitation is to set up a rainy day fund. \u201cA healthy minerals savings fund, the size of which should reflect not only the volume of revenues from mineral resources but also the size of the national economy, is usually recommended for resource-rich countries,\u201d said NEITI in a recent policy brief.\n\nWhile Nigeria has a fund to save oil windfalls above budgetary benchmarks but NEITI said the funds are mostly inadequately ring-fenced and are too tiny to fully serve the intended purpose. As oil income dwindles and any hope of windfall dims to a flicker, the fund will get increasingly smaller.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s three \u2018rainy day\u2019 funds \u2013 Stabilisation Fund, Excess Crude Account, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) \u2013 with about $2.25 billion, was able to fund about 7.7 percent of the revised 2020 federal budget.\n\nThis compared poorly with Norway, with a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1 trillion. To assuage the impact of COVID-19 on the government\u2019s earning, Nigeria withdrew $150million but Norway cashed $37b.\n\nThe new Petroleum Industry Act has no provision to compel government agencies to deepen funding for these funds or ring-fence them against abuse.\n\n\u201cWhile the PIB has some commendable provisions, a few issues such as financial savings are not dealt with,\u201d Ayodele Oni, an energy lawyer told BusinessDay.\n\nNEITI has severally called for the amendment of Section 162 (1)of the 1999 Constitution which prescribes that government income, apart from personal income tax, should be placed in the Federation Account and shared among the Federal, State, and Local Governments. This has all but removed any incentive to save for the rainy day.\n\nGuyana is keen to avoid that fate. However, the country has made mistakes all-rookie oil producers often made \u2013 kowtowing to oil majors in contract design and policy formulation due to scant technical knowledge. American oil major ExxonMobil exerts a domineering influence over the country\u2019s oil.\n\nIn 2015, Guyana\u2019s first commercial petroleum discovery was announced by ExxonMobil, the operator of a large offshore block. Soon, thereafter, the company began preparations for production with a first oil target of 2020.\n\nIt has set up Sovereign Wealth Fund to effectively manage the economy and the expected revenue windfall ahead of first oil. The country\u2019s wealth fund currently stands at US$534 million,\n\n\u201cGuyana is a resource-rich, underdeveloped economy. Oil revenue is a bonus to accelerate Guyana\u2019s economic transformation, modernization, diversification, and development over the next decade,\u201d according to the Guyana Oil and Gas Energy Chamber, which backed the bill.\n\nGuyana seeks to leverage its oil and gas discoveries over the past half-decade to build up an economy powered by its own energy resources.\n\nThe South American nation became a crude oil exporter in early 2020, thanks to Exxon\u2019s huge discoveries offshore Guyana. Over the past two years, the U.S. supermajor and Hess Corp, its partner in the prolific Stabroek block, have made a dozen more discoveries, while the Liza Phase 1 project is very profitable for the oil corporations and for Guyana.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Government has disclosed plans to set up a committee to monitor and audit orphanage homes in the state, threatening to close down and prosecute orphanage homes operating as businesses as against their designation as charities.\n\nThe Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues, Maria Edeko, who disclosed this to journalists in Benin City, said the committee will formulate holistic policies on the management of orphanage homes and adoption, in line with the state\u2019s child rights law.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cOrphanages are charity homes set up to cater for children without parents, those beyond parental care and other vulnerable persons, whose parents may be alive but are unable to cater for them, but today our people have a misconception about these homes and see them as business ventures.\n\n\u201cThey build orphanage homes with the intention to make a profit, rather than for charitable purposes. Some even add a maternity side by side with the orphanage homes where they deliver people of babies and turn the place into a baby factory; they bring underage children to such homes to make babies and sell same, or traffic these children, as far as outside Nigeria, despite the restriction on international adoption.\u201d\n\nEdeko continued: \u201cOrphans are vulnerable persons; they are subject to all forms of exploitation; they are vulnerable to being trafficked, abused and sold. You will understand that the issue of human trafficking has been a very strong challenge globally and at the state level, Governor Godwin Obaseki has made serious efforts to stamp out human trafficking in Edo State.\n\n\u201cAs the ministry with the responsibility to investigate any adoption process, in line with the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda, we are committed to sanitizing the system and will be setting up a committee to audit orphanage homes in Edo State and come up with holistic policies on adoption and management of orphanage homes, in line with the child rights law. This is topmost on our agenda for the new year.\u201d\n\nShe further stated: \u201cThe government of Governor Obaseki is talking about institutional reforms and sectoral reforms. It then means we must reform every department that is within the purview of this ministry. So, we have continued to train and retrain the proprietors and proprietresses of these orphanage homes, and looking at these children today, I can see they are very beautiful; they are doing things that normal children will do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to do an audit and remove all those that came into this as a business. It is a charity and if you do not have the heart to do charity, you cannot be in the issue of managing orphanage homes. If you are here for the wrong reason, better take your leave. It is not going to work and we will put many of them behind bars and we will close the orphanages that are for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly those that are for true charity will be allowed to function, as there are standards for running orphanage homes in Edo State,\u201d the commissioner noted.\n\n...",

This development had forestalled crime and criminality in major cities, towns and communities across the state.\n\nThe trend has seen an increase in activity and investment in the creative and entertainment industry as well as retail and hospitality sectors, which has witnessed a boom with new players.\n\nA cross-section of residents in Edo State hailed the state government for the peaceful atmosphere in which they marked the Yuletide festivities.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Benin City, they said the celebrations went on peacefully, owing to interventions by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration, which include support to the Edo Police Command, deployment of vigilante security network and other security agencies that ensured that the Yuletide was celebrated in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nMr. Lawrence Edgar, a resident in Benin City, said \u201cThe Christmas and New Year festivities have been quite pleasurable and eventful. Everybody is going about their activities peacefully. I appreciate the state government\u2019s collaboration with the Police and other security agencies especially with the deployment of local vigilantes, which ensured security and peaceful celebration, preventing criminals from operating freely.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe all can see how the improved security contributed to the successful hosting of concerts and events across the city without any incident of violence. It is a good thing that people are able to move freely.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Mr. Emmanuel Aroyameh, said the state government\u2019s effort in restoring streetlights to major parts of the city also helped in ensuring security, noting, \u201cThe state government\u2019s support to security agencies and local vigilantes must be commended. What is happening in Benin City with the streetlights is interesting and the palliative work on the road made driving around the city easy and pleasurable.\u201d\n\nA finance expert, Mr. Ikponwonsa Nosakhare, said improved security in the state has had a huge impact on the investment scene as it has ensured a lot of investment in different sectors of the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPeople are often concerned about the safety of their investment. Hence, it is not surprising that there is increased activity in the state\u2019s hospitality and real estate sectors. The governor is to be commended. He made all this possible with the bold reforms in security management.\u201d\n\n...",

Olayiwola Afolabi, a Benin based legal practitioner and advocate of social Justice praised EDSTMA for being a viable traffic agency whose display of professionalism has helped to restore faith and respect in the Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s led administration.\n\nHe appreciated and commended the agency and its officers for their stellar performance during the yuletide celebration where they had to work late into the night for ease of vehicular movement which helped to reduce road rage and incidents of road traffic crashes within the Benin metropolis.\n\nManaging Director EDSTMA, Dennis Oloriegbe speaking on achievements for year 2021, said, aside from carrying out its basic function, which is traffic management, the agency was able to reduce traffic menace to fifty percent (50%). There was also an expansion of operations to outside Benin, to Auchi, Uromi and Ekpoma.\n\nFor 2022, Oloriegbe declared the need to expand to Okada and Owan axis. There is need to expand to the hinterland within the Benin metropolis such as Ugbor zone which comprises \u201cfirst and second Ugbor zone.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that EDSTMA was receiving a tow truck for official use this year which would boost efficiency and professionalism aside easing the stress of going out to borrow a tow truck for use when there is a breakdown.\n\nAvowing that there are already a bucket list of activities for the year, the EDSTMA boss said, \u201cWe are starting with the installation of bus-stops haven identified such. We want passengers to be able to identify their bus-stops. This would stop the menace of drivers stopping anyhow on the road.\n\n\u201cBefore the end of January, we would start installation. What we are doing now is production. We are coming up with bus-stop road signs with the names of such bus-stops. A driver should be able to call a name to which a passenger responds. Not just stopping at random everywhere. This is one of the basic cause of holdups in Benin.\u201d\n\nOloriegbe reiterated that the level of sensitization of drivers last year was high with the enactment of traffic transportation policies especially with the Obhakhawaye Central Transport Terminal coming into place. Modalities were put in place to sensitize drivers in that park and other parks on the dangers of driving against traffic (one way traffic violation),\n\n\u201cWe built a synergy with the Psychiatric Hospital, Uselu, which was strange to drivers. We had to sensitive them that it was just to evaluate the mental health of violators. It is not a punitive measure on all drivers as was erroneously believed. We sensitized them on the fact that drivers should just keep to the laws. If they keep to the law, they would not be harassed or arrested.\u201d\n\nAs part of the end of year activities EDSTMA unveiled its maiden anthem. There was a parade display/competition from its twelve zones. The EDSTMA headquarters brigade clinched the first prize closely followed by zones 4 and 6. There were a lot of games which had immediate rewards for winners.\n\nAn interesting twist was added to the ceremony when two officers Ode Christiana and Momoh Martins based on public recognition were rewarded with money and a bag of rice each by Olayiwola Afolabi an awardee, to spur them to greater heights, in the discharge of their duties.\n\n...",

They are too busy talking about GYB and never talking about themselves.\n\n\u201cThey are too busy throwing mud at GYB and never telling the people what they have in stock for Nigeria. So interesting they have made the phenomenal history maker called GYB, their politics.\n\n\u201cAfter 61 years of nationhood, Nigeria needs a leader who is sincerely committed to building on the success of the administration he intends to succeed. Buhari has done that with Jonathan\u2019s strides on Infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOnly Governor Yahaya Bello has clearly said that when he becomes President he will improve on the profound legacies of the incumbent President.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHe has said in no uncertain terms that governance is a continuum, and that he will give life and strength to the profound legacies of President Mohammadu Buhari whilst improving and rejigging the sectors needing progressive surgical impact. He is not prevaricating like the others. And he is not hypocritical.\n\n\u201cTell those seeking the office of President to campaign on their merits, tell them to learn from GYB and his team, and predicate the politics of 2023 on issues. And tell them, the Youths want debate on issues, that Nigerians crave a new republic of issues based politics, and that we must get.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of the politics of falsehood, deceit, lies and chicanery. Tell the Cynics that whilst they continue to make hysteria, apologies to Rev. Jesse Jackson, GYB will continue to make history, as we are committed to redefining the fabrics of our politics with competency and capacity rather than mudslinging and tommyrot.\n\n\u201cIn the days, weeks and months ahead Nigerians craving for a New Deal in leadership will find sufficient reasons and cause to stick to and with the phenomenal history maker called GYB as the great strides and feats of his watch over Kogi State shall reach even greater heights in the year 2022. With GYB a more prosperous united Nigeria is assured,\u201d he said.",

Some of the villagers who escaped are now taking refuge in other communities around Okada.\n\nOne of the victims, Mattu Alli, from Taraba State narrated his ordeal: \u201cI lack words to explain what I witness in our community. I have been here for over 20 years with my family and we farm. I was in my compound with my family having a good time when we started hearing gunshots and saw people running in different directions.\n\n\u201cI saw one Benin man running towards my compound, I asked him where he was running to and he said herdsmen have taken over the village chasing people away from their houses. So I called my wife and we ran for our lives. I did not see my children every one of us ran in different directions. As I speak to you now, I don\u2019t know the whereabouts of my wife and children.\n\n\u201cOne of the Fulani herdsmen pointed a gun at me and said they were for peace. He said they would only kill people if they refused to allow their cows to feed on their crops. \u2018The yams and cassava you people have are for our cows. If you people touch our cows we will kill everybody in this village.\u2019 For us to be safe, we ran to the next community.\n\nAnother victim, Sunday Chimen, said: \u201cI have been in this village for over 20 years farming. What we saw surprised us. We heard gunshots and people running in all directions. We later discovered that Fulani Herdsmen had taken over our community with sophisticated AK 47 and threatened to kill us if we didn\u2019t cooperate with them.\n\n\u201cFor us to stay alive, we decided to run for our dear lives leaving our properties and running to unknown places. We are calling on the security agencies to come to our aid as our community is under siege.\u201d\n\nMrs Ngozi Chimen who was also affected said: \u201cThe nefarious activities of these Fulani herdsmen have been going on in our community for the last two months. They entered into our farms, chased us away and harvest our plantain to feed their cows. You dare not look at their faces. Some of them were in Army uniform. We need help, we need government assistant.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Edo State Police Command Public Relations Officer, SP Kotongs Bello, said he has not been briefed on the development.\n\nHowever, he promised to get back as soon as he finished speaking with the Division Police Officer in charge of the area but was yet to do so at the time of filing this report.

          "text": "dSuspected Fulani herdsman, armed and dressed in military uniform, on Sunday reportedly invaded a farming community, 2nd Abumere Ojigbelu Camp in the Ovia Northeast Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\nThe marauders were said to have chased the villagers away taking over their farms, homes and properties. Some of the villagers who escaped are now taking refuge in other communities around Okada.\n\nOne of the victims, Mattu Alli, from Taraba State narrated his ordeal: \u201cI lack words to explain what I witness in our community. I have been here for over 20 years with my family and we farm. I was in my compound with my family having a good time when we started hearing gunshots and saw people running in different directions.\n\n\u201cI saw one Benin man running towards my compound, I asked him where he was running to and he said herdsmen have taken over the village chasing people away from their houses. So I called my wife and we ran for our lives. I did not see my children every one of us ran in different directions. As I speak to you now, I don\u2019t know the whereabouts of my wife and children.\n\n\u201cOne of the Fulani herdsmen pointed a gun at me and said they were for peace. He said they would only kill people if they refused to allow their cows to feed on their crops. \u2018The yams and cassava you people have are for our cows. If you people touch our cows we will kill everybody in this village.\u2019 For us to be safe, we ran to the next community.\n\nAnother victim, Sunday Chimen, said: \u201cI have been in this village for over 20 years farming. What we saw surprised us. We heard gunshots and people running in all directions. We later discovered that Fulani Herdsmen had taken over our community with sophisticated AK 47 and threatened to kill us if we didn\u2019t cooperate with them.\n\n\u201cFor us to stay alive, we decided to run for our dear lives leaving our properties and running to unknown places. We are calling on the security agencies to come to our aid as our community is under siege.\u201d\n\nMrs Ngozi Chimen who was also affected said: \u201cThe nefarious activities of these Fulani herdsmen have been going on in our community for the last two months. They entered into our farms, chased us away and harvest our plantain to feed their cows. You dare not look at their faces. Some of them were in Army uniform. We need help, we need government assistant.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Edo State Police Command Public Relations Officer, SP Kotongs Bello, said he has not been briefed on the development.\n\nHowever, he promised to get back as soon as he finished speaking with the Division Police Officer in charge of the area but was yet to do so at the time of filing this report.

          "text": "The CNG said, \u201cIn the North especially, government should, with the entire national resolve behind its efforts, work to achieve final disengagement, disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and reconstruction within the next few months. Unless this is done as quickly as possible, the 2023 elections would be greatly threatened and that would in turn affect the nation\u2019s democratic progress and set the country back several decades.\n\n\u201cIt is expected also that the Federal Government would review and improve the current structure of the national security assets, increase number of boots on ground, improve quality of equipment and greater synergy with the communities.\u201d\n\nThe CNG maintained that the state governments in the North must get off their high horse and listen to advice, and design a uniform approach to the situation with the full involvement of the communities.\n\nSuleiman said, \u201cThe fact that the problem is insidious and not readily apparent is the more reason why it should be seen as an existential matter that needs to be addressed and tackled robustly and defeated once for all.\n\n\u201cNo nation can aspire to greatness or seek to remain secure and safe when its youth and the productive segments of society are left to indulge in self-destructive practices like drug and substance abuse.\n\n\u201cSerious challenges such as the ones we are faced with, ought not be treated with the level of levity and condescension shown by the governors of the affected northern states, neither should they be seen as affecting only one region or state or, for that matter, one ethnic group or the other. On the contrary, such challenges are cross-national issues that affect every one of us, regardless of where we live or come from.\u201d\n\nSuleiman further noted that the security problem must be confronted collectively with the entire will and resolve of the people behind the effort \u201cif we are to build on the current successes by our gallant troops in the North-East and, more recently, in the endangered communities and forests of northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFailure to do so will indubitably mean that every effort made in isolation will defeat all the endeavours and render the task of ending the crisis the more difficult and futile.\n\n\u201cEvery one of us must therefore become a stakeholder and a committed actor in this struggle to free our society and our country of this debilitating problem.\u201d",
          "summary": "The CNG said, \u201cIn the North especially, government should, with the entire national resolve behind its efforts, work to achieve final disengagement, disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and reconstruction within the next few months.\nUnless this is done as quickly as possible, the 2023 elections would be greatly threatened and that would in turn affect the nation\u2019s democratic progress and set the country back several decades.\n\u201cNo nation can aspire to greatness or seek to remain secure and safe when its youth and the productive segments of society are left to indulge in self-destructive practices like drug and substance abuse.\n\u201cFailure to do so will indubitably mean that every effort made in isolation will defeat all the endeavours and render the task of ending the crisis the more difficult and futile.\n\u201cEvery one of us must therefore become a stakeholder and a committed actor in this struggle to free our society and our country of this debilitating problem.\u201d",

          "text": "While signing into law, the N17.127trillion 2022 budget on Friday last week, President Muhammadu Buhari expressed some reservations bordering on removal of some of the original proposals and insertions of new ones. TAIYE ODEWALE reports\n\nMeaning of budget\n\nBudget as commonly defined is financial statement of intention or proposals on expected incomes or revenues and projected expenditures to be made in a fiscal year by government at whatever level, be it federal, state or local government, as obtainable in Nigeria.\n\nExecutive, legislature contention on budgetary proposals\n\nOver the years since the advent of this fourth republic, there had been contentions between the executive and legislative arms of government, particularly at the federal level as regards budgetary proposals and projections.\n\nWhile the executive arm of government as empowered by relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), believes that since it has the power to prepare budget, projections and proposals to that effect on expected incomes and expenditure, should be solely determined by it; the legislature feels otherwise based on the power of appropriation conferred on it by relevant provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe misinterpretations or misunderstanding of such constitutional provisions, have always made the affected two arms of government to be at loggerhead anytime budgetary proposals are forwarded for consideration, passage and signing into law by President of the country.\n\nIn the past, such disagreements or rancour often cropped up allegations of padding of budgetary estimates for proposed projects between the two affected arms of government.\n\n9th NASS and President Buhari\u2019s harmonious approach\n\nThough since 2019 after the inauguration of the 9th National Assembly, rapport for minimized disagreements on budgetary proposals and approvals between the Presidency and the National Assembly have been created, aside restoration of yearly budgetary cycle to January \u2013 December timeline, but observations on tinkering on proposals made, have always been made by President Buhari at the point of signing the budget.\n\nThe 2022 dimension\n\nSuch observations by President Muhammadu Buhari, however, took a different dimension last Friday before assenting to the N17.127trillion 2022 budget which many watchers of polity perceived to be serious disagreement and beginning of feud between the two arms of government.\n\nBuhari\u2019s observations\n\nPresident Muhammadu had through a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Garba Shehu, at the signing of the 2022 budget, expressed deep concern over alleged \u201cworrisome\u201d tampering and \u201cchanges\u201d made to the Bill by both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nHe announced that he would revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment as soon as the Assembly resumes to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to this administration did not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\nThe President recounted that during the presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, he had stated that the fiscal year 2022 would be very crucial in his administration\u2019s efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects, as well as improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal.\n\n\u201cSome of the worrisome changes are as follows: Increase in projected FGN Independent Revenue by N400 billion, the justification for which is yet to be provided to the Executive;\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion without any explanation\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction of the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is particularly worrisome because personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances;\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, an increase of N21.72 billion in the Overhead budgets of some MDAs, while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification;\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion.\n\n\u201cOthers are deductions in provisions for some critical projects, including N12.6 billion in the Ministry of Transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing Rail Modernisation projects; N25.8 billion from Power Sector Reform Programme under the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning; N14.5 billion from several projects of the Ministry of Agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this Ministry and its agencies.\n\n\u201cInclusion of new provisions totaling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018The changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects were reduced while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments, and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed and costed.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many more projects have been added to the budgets of some MDAs with no consideration for the institutional capacity to execute the additional projects and/or for the incremental recurrent expenditure that may be required.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe wondered that despite the National Assembly increasing projected revenue by N609.27 billion, the additional Executive request of N186.53 billion for critical expenditure items could not be accommodated without increasing the deficit, while the sum of N550.59 billion from the projected incremental revenues was allocated at the discretion of National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018I signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to enable its implementation to commence on 1st January 2022.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, I will revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment and/or virement as soon as the Assembly resumes to ensure that critical ongoing projects that are cardinal to this administration, and those nearing completion, do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding\u201d, he stressed.\n\nPublic apprehension\n\nExpectedly, due to the seriousness of the President\u2019s reservations, some Nigerians have started expressing concerns on the cordial relationship existing between both arms of government within the last three years.\n\nBut the Presidency in a statement on Sunday night, declared that observations or reservations expressed by President Buhari on changes made on the 2022 budget by the National Assembly will not in anyway affect their harmonious working relationship.\n\nHowever, whether the harmonious working relationship will be affected or not, will surely be known when the planned supplementary budget is forwarded to the National Assembly for approval as the federal lawmakers may not want their own constituency projects to be tampered with.",

This is purely temporary in view of the recent spike in cases and will be removed any moment the situation abates. It\u2019s a growing practice in government offices in many countries.\n\n\u201cAlthough some exceptions have been made for a few leaders in government coming from outside the Villa, they too are encouraged to do those tests.\n\n\u201cThis policy has rightfully been justified following the discovery of COVID-19 positivity in some of those tested since the last few days of the practice,\u201d Shehu said.\n\nLast week, some aides of President Muhammadu Buhari were said to have tested positive for the virus.\n\nShehu announced last week that he tested positive for COVID and subsequently went into isolation. He later announced in a Facebook post that he has recovered from the virus.\n\nThe Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Mohammed Bello in a statement personally signed by him on Friday announced that he has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAlso, Nigeria has reported a steady rise in COVID infections in what has been confirmed as the fourth wave of the pandemic by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).\n\nDirector-General of NCDC, Dr Ifedayo Adetifa in December said Nigeria has recorded a 500% increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over the past two weeks across the country caused by the Delta and Omicron variants.",

During the election, Tofa squared off against MKO Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the presumed winner of the election. But the Babangida regime annulled the election.\n\nAlthough the official results of the election were never released by Babangida\u2019s government, Tofa was apparently defeated in the presidential election by his rival Moshood Abiola. Babangida was forced to step down in August 1993 after protests calling for the results of the election.\n\nREAD ALSO: 2022 Budget: Buhari Will Not Hamper Implementation Despite Changes \u2013 Garba Shehu\n\nBorn in Kano on June 20, 1947, Mr Tofa had his primary education at Shahuci Junior Primary, Kano, and continued at City Senior Primary School in Kano. From 1962 to 1966, he attended Provincial College, Kano.\n\nAfter completing his studies at the Provincial school, he worked for Royal Exchange Insurance company from 1967 to 1968. He also attended City of London College from 1970 to 1973.\n\nTofa\u2019s sojourn into politics started in 1976 when he was a councilor of Dawakin Tofa Local Government Council, in 1977, he was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly.\n\nDuring the Nigerian Second Republic, Tofa was at various times the secretary of the Kano branch of NPN, he later became the party\u2019s national financial secretary and was a national member of the Green Revolution National Committee.\n\nDuring the Third Republic, he was part of the Liberal Movement which metamorphosed to the Liberal Convention when it was not registered as a political party, Tofa joined NRC in 1990.\n\nIn 1993, when the Babangida administration introduced the Option A4 system, Tofa was elected the presidential candidate representing Kano.\n\nDuring the party primaries, he defeated Pere Ajunwa, Joe Nwodo, and Dalhatu Tafida to clinch the NRC ticket. At the time, he was an ally of Halilu Akilu, the security chief at the time. His running mate in the election was Sylvester Ugoh, an Igbo and a former governor of the now-defunct Central Bank of Biafra. Both were members of the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN).\n\nMr Tofa was also a businessman and an industrialist.",
