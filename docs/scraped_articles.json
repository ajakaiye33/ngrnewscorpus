          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern have tackled the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan over his comments regarding the presence of Turkish terrorists in Nigeria.\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by its Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, on Friday said the Turkish President\u2019s claims were baseless while adding that ISWAP and Boko Haram are the terrorists present in the country.\n\nMURIC\u2019s statement comes after Erdo\u011fan claimed the terrorists who tried to carry out a coup in his country were present in Nigeria during his official visit to president Buhari on Thursday.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cWe take the Turkish president\u2019s allegation that there are Turkish terrorists in Nigeria with a pinch of salt. It is false, baseless and of no consequence whatsoever.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the existence of Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists in the country but we reject the attempt to label innocent Turkish citizens as terrorists just because there is a political difference between them and their president.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge Erdogan\u2019s role as a leading mouthpiece of the Muslim world and a stout defender of Islam, particularly against Western stigmatisation. But that does not confer on him the right to label the opposition in his country as terrorists and to haunt them all over the place. Erdogan should stick to what we know him for as the unrelenting defender of world Muslims.\n\n\u201cNeither should Erdogan\u2019s humongous Muslim hero image becloud nor diminish MURIC\u2019s commitment to protecting Allah-given fundamental human rights of Muslims in Nigeria, be it, individual or group. This is where the issue of protecting the rights of members of HIzmet in Nigeria comes in.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Islamic rights group, the group Erdo\u011fan calls terrorists are impacting the lives of Muslims in the country.\n\n\u201cWhat we know of them is that they build primary and secondary schools, universities and hospitals. They also engage in humanitarian services, assisting poor Muslims to meet religious obligations like hajj and sacrificial animals.\n\n\u201cThey have been in this country for more than 20 years (even before Erdogan became Prime Minister) and some of the institutions established by them in Nigeria are two decades old already. A coup that allegedly occurred in Turkey five years ago while these people were still in Nigeria should not be hanged on their necks,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "Kaduna residents, especially farmers, have raised an alarm that poor harvest resulting in insufficient foodstuff in markets, as well as an increase in prices, will negatively impact low-income earners.\n\nThey opined that if the prices of yam, beans, rice, and others remain beyond the reach of low-income earners this harvesting season, it will be difficult for them to survive in a few months\u2019 time.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Rose Enemaku, who sells yam and beans in wholesales, \u201cWe are afraid of going to bush markets outside to buy directly from farmers unlike before, due to kidnappers.\n\n\u201cAgain, the Kaduna State Government in its wisdom suspended the bush markets and some major markets within Kaduna city. Farmers who supply foodstuff to those markets are no longer coming. It becomes difficult for us, to get these food items in large quantities and sell to those in need.\u201d\n\nShe further added that most farmers now have stocked their harvested crops, awaiting when they have financial needs while others refused to sell because they have no other source of feeding.\n\nAlso, Alhaji Idris Yubangba who said he buys directly from farmers in some remote villages in Kaduna expressed sadness over the restriction of motorcyclists and tricycles in Kaduna State.\n\nHe said, \u201cI penetrated some villages in Kaduna to buy food crops during harvest season in the past. I used motorcycles because roads to interior villages are not habitable for cars and buses. But, as it is now, I cannot go because the state government has banned the use of motorcycles.\n\n\u201d Most farmers would not like to sell the few crops harvested because, they too, have families to feed.\u201d\n\nA farmer in the Kajuru Local Government Area of the state, Mallam Tijani Mohammed, said, unlike before wheN he harvested 100 bags of maize, 200,000 tubers of yam and 9000 bags of beans, this year he only harvested two bags of beans, three bags of maize and are meant for family consumption.\n\n\u201cThe fear of kidnappers do not allow us to farm this year. I only farmed within my residence where I have a little portion of land. What I harvested is not enough for me and my four wives and 18 children.\n\n\u201cThis year is going to be terrible because the famine is rearing its ugly head, right from the harvesting period. Tell me, before and after Christmas, only God will help us,\u201d he said.\n\nChairman, Farmers Association, Kaduna State Chapter, Alhaji Umar Modugo noted that bandits have stopped farmers from going to farm this year.\n\nHe said framers were ready to farm but the fear of kidnappers frustrated them. Especially, when they heard that some farmers were beheaded in one part of the state.",

Our group has in a different forum enjoined Professor Osinbajo to indicate interest in the 2023 presidential bid, and he is yet to respond to this appeal; saying that he abandoned such ambition before a declaration, therefore, suggests that someone is confusing the public.\u201d\n\nOGO noted that the report was aimed at dissuading Osinbajo from declaring to contest in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO) considers this a mind game, and ploy to dissuade the Vice President from exercising his democratic and constitutional rights as a leader with unique leadership skills and robust management style, assuming he chooses to give our pleas a thought.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, Prof. Osinbajo holds Asiwaju Tinubu in high esteem and will not contribute in any way to bring him into disrepute or cause cracks between them; however, as a democrat, we believe that the former Lagos State governor will not shut the democratic door against Osinbajo should the VP decides to run for the President, and he will do this, without bitterness,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Abuja urged Ogoni leaders to sensitize indigenes on the value of protecting national assets like pipelines and other oil installations, saying wilful damages usually create more havoc on their environment and hamper development in the area.\n\nReceiving some leaders and people of Ogoni Land at the State House, the President noted that the Federal Government was committed to the cleaning up of Ogoniland so that indigenes can regain their lives, return to farms and reactivate economic activities.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity.\n\n\u201cYou will need to educate the people of Ogoni land and the region more than when pipelines are broken, the damage is more to the immediate environment and the people. The majority of farmers and fishermen struggle because the fishes now move to the deep sea,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said bad industry practices coupled with security challenges had resulted in massive spills with attendant environmental degradation of Ogoni, leading to agitations and strife.\n\nHe said the government would bring to a close all pending issues on sons of Ogoni Land.\n\n\u201cYour Royal Highnesses, distinguished representatives of the people of Ogoni Land, I note the need to ensure completion of a segment of the East-West road traversing Ogoni Land, and steps will be taken to ensure delivery under the Infrastructure Development Fund as earlier conceived. We intend to complete this vital artery of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we are committed to ensuring clemency and national integration as part of this Administration\u2019s bid to lay the foundation for genuine reconciliation and bring closure to the issues of Ogoni Land.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate incidents of the early 1990s leading to the loss of lives of distinguished sons of Ogoni Land and the collateral judicial processes are indelible in our memories.\n\n\u201cDespite the grievous circumstances, the Federal Government will consider the request for the grant of pardon to finally close the Ogoni saga,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari noted.\n\nAccording to the President, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Ltd (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), had been granted a license to operate OML11, which will stimulate economic activities and integration in the zone.\n\n\u201cTo ensure the stimulation of economic activities in Ogoni Land as underpinned by the vast petroleum resources underlying Ogoni Land and neighbouring communities, NPDC, a subsidiary of the NNPC, has been granted a licence to operate OML11.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, NNPC is hereby directed to engage all host communities, particularly Ogoni people, to ensure inclusive processes of oil and gas exploration and production is anchored on optimum involvement of host communities. NPDC will lay a broad-based programme for the emergence of a new Ogoni Land for the benefit of the Ogoni people and Nigeria as a whole,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said he was aware of the passage of the Bill on the Federal University of Environmental Technology by the National Assembly and awaits transmission for further necessary action.\n\n\u201cThis Administration has placed the rehabilitation of the Niger Delta as a top priority and has committed a lot of resources to tackle existing problems, including launching a US One Billion dollar oil clean-up exercise to reverse the terrible damage and restore the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that the restoration and amelioration activities under the auspices of the United Nations and the vehicle of Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project have commenced work since we assumed office as we promised.\n\n\u201cWe will take further steps to ensure faithful and speedy execution of the project so as to restore the environment and enable farming and fishing activities to resume in the affected areas,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President also appreciated the leaders for recognition of the Federal Government\u2019s efforts to clean up the area and stimulate more economic activities.\n\n\u201cYour Royal Highnesses and very distinguished people of Ogoni Land, I thank you very much for your kind words and recognition of efforts made by our administration to bring progress to your part and all parts of the country,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe trial of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has been adjourned to November 10 after he pleaded not guilty to a seven-count charge preferred against him by the Federal Government.\n\nThis is as he urged the Federal High Court to decline its jurisdiction to adjudicate over the charge filed against him.\n\nThe IPOB leader noted that from the amended charge, the only element requisite to constitute and found liability for incitement allegedly occurred wholly and entirely in London, United Kingdom and not anywhere within Nigeria.\n\nIn his notice of preliminary objections, Kanu argued that the alleged broadcasts were not shown to have occurred at sea or on the international waters abutting Nigeria, adding: \u201cI know as a fact that London, United Kingdom, is a sovereign state under International Municipal Law and has municipal laws punishing criminal offences.\u201d\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nKanu stated this through his counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, shortly after he was re-arraigned on the amended charge before Justice Binta Nyako of the Abuja division of the Federal High Court, yesterday.\n\nKanu, who jumped bail following the chaos that characterised the military invasion of his residence was in June 2021 re-arrested in Kenya and extradited to face his trial.\n\nHe was first arrested in a Lagos hotel in 2015 by operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) and arraigned alongside four others in 2016.\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s trial that was characterised by heavy security presence, Kanu arrived the court by 8am in a white Fendi designers cloth and was ushered into the courtroom at 10am by security operatives. He took his fresh plea to the amended charges at about 10:45am.\n\nBut he pleaded not guilty even as his lawyer had requested he be transferred to the custody of the correctional service centre. Justice Nyako, however, declined to grant the request on the grounds that it would be in the interest of Kanu to remain with the DSS.\n\nNyako adjourned to November 10 for hearing of Kanu\u2019s application challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction to try him and the competence of the charge.\n\nAmong issues raised in the Notice of Preliminary Objection are that the said charge did not in anyway link the defendant to the charge and the alleged offences were committed in the United Kingdom, amongst others.\n\nHowever, Ohaneze Ndigbo has accused the Federal Government of conducting a secret trial on Kanu.\n\nChief Ralph Uwazurike, who spoke alongside former Anambra governor, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, said the apex-Igbo socio-cultural group condemned the trial in its entirety because they were barred from covering the proceedings.\n\nSimilarly, Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, also condemned the action of the Federal Government, claiming he ought not to be barred from witnessing the proceedings as a federal lawmaker. He lamented that even after filing a case in the matter, he was still denied access.\n\nJournalists were also barred from entering the courtroom.This was despite the fact that the journalists had forwarded their names to the court and DSS for coverage of the proceedings.\n\nKanu, in the preliminary objections filed by counsel said: \u201cI also know as a fact that jurisdiction is extrinsic to adjudication. It is conferred on a Court, aliunde. It is not intrinsic. That I know as a matter of fact, that as the element necessary to constitute incitement in the alleged several broadcasts of the Defendant/Applicant occurred in London, United Kingdom, and not in Nigeria, the court in Nigeria has no jurisdiction to try the defendant/applicant on any charge founded on any such alleged incitement, even if the defendant/applicant enters within the geographical boundaries of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe affidavit in support deposed to by Chinwe Umeche equally averred that \u201cI also know as a matter of fact that the alleged offences for which the defendant was charged, do not constitute terrorism offences in London, United Kingdom, where they were allegedly committed.\n\n\u201cThat I am further aware that there is an obligation on the Attorney General of the Federation, to maintain international co-operation for compliance with international treaties on terrorism.\n\n\u201cThat the defendant was abducted from Kenya and consequently extraordinarily rendered to Nigeria, without firstly subjecting him to extradition proceedings in Kenya. I know as a fact thatamended would amount to allowing the complainant to benefit from their illegality and wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThat I am aware that he who comes to equity must come with clean hands, and no party should be allowed to benefit from his wrong doing.\n\n\u201cThat I know as a matter of fact, that the extraordinary rendition of the defendant robs the Honourable Court of the requisite jurisdiction of trying the defendant on counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Amended Charge.\n\n\u201cThat counts 1, 2 and 3 of the amended charge were brought under a non-existent law. That count 3 of the amended charge relates to an offence allegedly committed in Ubuluisiuzor, in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State, which is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cThat I know as a matter of fact that an offence can only be tried by a court exercising jurisdiction over the place or area where the alleged offence was committed. That counts 5, 6 and 7 of the amended charge do not disclose an offence known to law. That there is no proof of evidence attached to the amended charge filed against the defendant. That even the purported proof of evidence to be relied upon by the prosecution does not disclose any prima facie case against the defendant.\n\n\u201cThat from the list of exhibits and witnesses attached to the amended charge, there is nothing relating to or linking the defendant to the 7-count charge, particularly counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 of thereof.\n\n\u201cThat no final pronouncement has been made on the purported proscription of the Indigenous People of Biafra, as the said purported proscription, is a subject matter of appeal in Appeal No: CA/A/214/2018, pending before the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cThat the defendant/applicant cannot be arraigned anew or tried for an offence when the judgment that made a pronouncement on the instrument constituting a state of affairs as such an offence, is the subject matter of an appeal. That it will be most unjust, painful, wicked and unfair for the Applicant to undergo the rigours of a full trial, when the amended charge as constituted, does not disclose a prima facie case against him.\n\n\u201cThat there is no ground for this Honorable Court to proceed with the trial against the applicant in the circumstance of this case.\n\n\u201cThat the Court has the powers and a duty to stop a prosecution which on the facts creates abuse and injustice.\n\n\u201cThat it will be in the best interest of justice if the present seven-count amended charge is struck out and or dismissed.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The people have a right to vote and select their leader.\n\n\u201cNo group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos, leading to murderous activities. The President has made it very clear that the Armed Forces and all law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place even if it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors; in the first place, we are in a democracy, secondly it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potentials for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country would also want to copy this same situation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mongonu, in the last two months, the military has recorded a lot of successes in the fight against insurgency in the North-East zone of the country which put pressure on the ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe fact again is that the armed forces, the land forces have done an excellent job because in the span of one month we have been able to take out the leadership of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) \u2013 that is Abu Musab Al-barnawi.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago, the man who succeeded him, one Malam Bako, one of the prominent leaders of the Shura Council of the Islamic State of West African Province, was also taken out.\n\n\u201cThey are also contending with leadership crisis.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has lauded the National Assembly for empowering the agency to determine and deploy appropriate technology in future elections.\n\nThe commission also appealed to the National Assembly to make broad provisions of laws to empower it to continue innovating without restriction to a specific technology.\n\nINEC\u2019s Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated this at a meeting with the Senate and House of Representatives Conference Committee on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 in Abuja, yesterday.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, the issue of technology in elections has dominated recent public discussions in Nigeria. The commission appreciates the decision of the National Assembly to empower INEC to determine and deploy appropriate technology in future elections. For us in INEC, this is one of the progressive decisions by our National Assembly. As you finalise on the Electoral Amendment Bill, I urge you to continue to endow the commission with power to determine what technology to deploy in our elections at the appropriate time.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cOne way of doing so is to make broad provisions of the law that will empower the commission to continue to innovate without restricting us to a specific technology, such as the Smart Card Reader, which could in due course become obsolete, inapplicable or irrelevant as is already the case, following the recent introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) by the commission. The commission looks forward to the conclusion of the process without which we cannot make the regulations and guidelines to give effect to the provisions of the law. Without the regulations and guidelines, we cannot finalise on the manuals for the training of officials that will conduct elections. There are extensive provisions in the current Bill that require clear guidance by the commission. With only 484 days to the 2023 general election, time is of the essence.\u201d\n\nYakubu said in addition to the Anambra State governorship election holding on November 6, the commission had already scheduled three major elections to be conducted next year.\n\n\u201cFirst is the Area Council election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) holding on February 12, 2022, followed by Ekiti governorship election on June 18, 2022 and Osun governorship election a month later on July 16, 2022. The Commission also has five pending bye-elections made up of three federal constituencies and two state constituencies to contend with.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act is one of the most important laws in any democracy. Election is a process anchored on a legal framework. First is the constitution, followed by the Electoral Act. In all jurisdictions, the Electoral Act provides more detailed provisions to govern the conduct of elections and the electoral process. One of the unique aspects of the current amendment of the Electoral Act is that it started well ahead of the forthcoming general election, unlike previous exercises which came too close to elections. The importance of starting early is that it allows for a thorough debate by citizens on aspects of the Bill long after the conventional public hearing as witnessed recently. Clearly, the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 is one of the most extensively debated Bills in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Buhari: Under No Circumstances Will Anambra Election Be Disrupted",
          "text": "\u2022Directs military, other security agencies to use overwhelming force if necessary to protect peaceful poll\n\n\u2022Says non-state actors won\u2019t be allowed to disrupt electoral process\n\n\u2022Nigerian forces kill al-Barnawi\u2019s successor two months after death of ISWAP leader\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday vowed that he would never allow anything or anyone to disrupt the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State. He made the declaration during a National Security Council (NSC) meeting in Abuja with the service chiefs, where the election and rising cases of violence became the focus of attention.\n\nHe gave marching orders to the security agencies to apply overwhelming force, if necessary, to protect the November 6 governorship election and ensure it was not interrupted by non-state actors who have been heating up the polity.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), disclosed the president\u2019s directive to journalists at the end of the security meeting. Monguno said besides the fact that the people of Anambra State deserved to elect a governor of their choice, the federal government would not sit by and let non-state actors set a wrong precedent in the country\u2019s electoral experience.\n\nThe NSA stated, \u201cThe president has directed that under no circumstances will anything be allowed to stop the elections from taking place successfully. The people have a right to vote, they have a right to select their leader, and no group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos, leading to murderous activities.\n\n\u201cThe president has made it very clear that the armed forces, security agencies, and law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place. If it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors. In the first place, we are in a democracy. Secondly, it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potential for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country will also want to copy this situation.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the council observed recent trends of violent activities and was desirous of seeing a hitch-free election in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe problem here is that in as much as the government wants to conduct peaceful elections, there are non-state actors who have been heating up the polity, who have made all kinds of attempts to stymie orderly elections for next month.\u201d\n\nMonguno maintained that the president did not want to contemplate a situation in which he would be boxed into a corner.\n\n\u201cThe mere thought that a group of non-state actors want to portray his government as not being able to be firm is totally out of the question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe tail cannot wag the dog, it is totally unacceptable and, again, we in the security and intelligence community have been trying as much as possible to talk with the leadership in the South-east, to make them aware of the fact that President Buhari is not averse to the aspirations of the people of the South-east,\u201d the NSA added.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cSo long as whatever they desire to achieve, they do it through the normal prescribed manner, either legislative, legal, or whatever. For as long as it is within the confines of legitimacy, President Buhari does not have a problem with that. But any action that is outlandish, any action that typifies roguery, the usurpation of the authority of the state is not going to be tolerated.\n\n\u201cAgain, we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that Nigerians, being what they are, also need to understand that if these non-state actors should go out on a limb and extend the frontiers of violence, and begin to kill people, there is a possibility that reprisal attacks can take place in other parts of the country, which is what we do not want to happen.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re working with the community leaders, with the governors and everybody to ensure that they bring their people, restrain them on the leash.\u201d\n\nHe also said the NSC reviewed the security situation across the country, noting that the various security formations \u2013 the armed forces, intelligence sector and the police \u2013 have been recording successes from one end of the country to another.\n\nAccording to him, in a short space of time, the armed forces have recorded victory over terrorist groups in the North-east, as they have eliminated, in quick succession, leaders of the notorious Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThe NSA said about two months after the Nigerian Army eliminated Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the dreaded leader of ISWAP, troops, just two days ago, killed his successor, Mallam Bako, in combat.\n\nMonguno said inter-agency cooperation among the various forces and agencies had yielded appreciable successes in communities and the economy.\n\nHe noted the unprecedented feat in security within the country\u2019s maritime environment and the recent elimination of a notorious gangster in Benue State, one Aondofa Kefas (Azonto).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOther aspects basically have to do with the current state of security in the country and the sub-region. Of course, the armed forces and security agencies have done so much in the last couple of months.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly, in the last six months, they have been able to record a lot of successes.\n\n\u201cNow the issue here is that it is not very easy for the wider society to appreciate the successes being recorded by the armed forces, because there will definitely be incidents of misadventure. This is asymmetric conflict; it is not like the normal conventional war in which territories are won, you grapple with the enemy, you defeat him, and you move on. Here we have the enemy embedded in society, coming from all parts.\n\n\u201cLike I once said, someone had remarked after the Brighton bombing of 1984, that the difference between the terrorist or the criminal and the state is that it only takes one act for the terrorist to succeed and gain a lot of publicity, but for the armed forces, for the government and its agencies, you have to succeed on every occasion, otherwise, after 12 successes, if you fail, or you have a problem on the 13th occasion, nobody wants to know.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the situation with which we are faced. But, nevertheless, I will just highlight that the Chief of Defense Staff, service chiefs, and intelligence heads briefed Council and I can tell you that for the land forces, they have recorded a lot of successes in the last two months.\n\n\u201cWe have had a steady increase in the number of returnees, both combatants and non-combatants, from the theatre of operation; both from the Islamic State of West Africa Province and the Boko Haram enclaves.\n\n\u201cNow what has happened is we are now having to contend with 15,852 returnees. This in its own case is accompanied by problems; humanitarian problems, problems of logistics, problems of profiling each and every one because we are not just interested in profiling the ex-combatants, we are also interested in profiling those people who are assumed to be non-combatants, who may have reached out and assisted the terrorists in one way or the other.\u201d\n\nCommenting on frequent attacks and stealing of the country\u2019s arms and ammunition by bandits and terrorists, the NSA said moves were being made to end the menace.\n\nHe explained, \u201cEfforts right now are underway. As you already know, yesterday, the president had an important visitor, the president of Turkey.\n\n\u201cJust like he has had discussions with the President of Turkey, he has had discussions with other leaders on how we can share intelligence and acquire technical capabilities to deal with these emerging threats. So, it is basically a matter of looking at where we can get equipment and assets to deal with these threats.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Wants quick presidential assent\n\n\u2022Without regulations, guidelines, we cannot finalise on manuals for training of officials\n\n\u2022INEC releases notice for Anambra governorship election\n\nChuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has appealed for the fast tracking of the processes leading to the passage and signing into law of the Electoral Act amendment Bill.\n\nThis is just as the Commission, yesterday, released the notice of the governorship election in Anambra State slated for November 6.\n\nWith only 484 days to the 2023 general elections, INEC said time was of essence if it would be able to put necessary guidelines in place for the elections in line with the provisions of the amended Electoral Act (2021).\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives Conference Committee on the Electoral Act amendment bill 2021 held in Abuja yesterday, in collaboration with Policy, Legislative and Advocacy Centre (PLAC), the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said without the timely passage of the bill, the Commission cannot make the regulations and guidelines to give effect to the provisions of the law.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cThe Commission looks forward to the conclusion of the process without which we cannot make the regulations and guidelines to give effect to the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cWithout the regulations and guidelines, we cannot finalise on the manuals for the training of officials that will conduct elections. There are extensive provisions in the current bill that requires clear guidance by the Commission\u201d\n\nYakubu also said early enactment of the Electoral law would enable the Commission to test-run procedures and pilot innovations ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe bill which is now at the last stage before the passage by the National Assembly and submission to the executive for assent, provides amongst others, the use of electronic device for transmission of election results.\n\nYakubu said in addition to the Anambra State governorship election holding on November 6, 2021, the Commission has already scheduled three major elections to be conducted next year.\n\n\u201cFirst is the Area Council election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) holding on 12th February 2022, followed by the Ekiti Governorship election on 18th June 2022 and the Osun Governorship election a month later on 16th July 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Commission also has five pending bye-elections made up of three Federal Constituencies and two State Constituencies to contend with.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that in a proactive manner, the Commission has been studying aspects of the amendment Bill and identifying areas that require the formulation of regulations and guidelines as well as the review of prescribed forms for implementation.\n\n\u201cThis will enable the Commission to test-run procedures and pilot innovations ahead of the 2023 General Election. The speedy passage of the Bill will be in the best interest of our electoral process,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile highlighting the fundamental role of the Electoral Act in the conduct of the election, Yakubu said the Act was one of the most important laws in any democracy.\n\nHe stated that one of the unique aspects of the current amendment of the Electoral Act was that it started well ahead of the forthcoming general elections, unlike previous exercises which came too close to elections.\n\nThe INEC boss solicited further cooperation from the National Assembly to make broad provisions of the law that would empower the Commission to continue to innovate without necessarily restricting it to a specific technology such as the Smart Card Reader which could in due course become obsolete, inapplicable or irrelevant as was the case the recent introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) by the Commission.\n\n\u201cElection is a process anchored on a legal framework. First is the constitution, followed by the Electoral Act. In all jurisdictions, the Electoral Act provides more detailed provisions to govern the conduct of elections and the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe importance of starting early is that it allows for a thorough debate by citizens on aspects of the Bill long after the conventional public hearing as witnessed recently. Clearly, the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 is one of the most extensively debated Bills in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, the issue of technology in elections has dominated recent public discussions in Nigeria. The Commission appreciates the decision of the National Assembly to empower INEC to determine and deploy appropriate technology in future elections.\n\n\u201cFor us at INEC, this is one of the progressive decisions by our National Assembly. As you finalise on the Electoral Amendment Bill, I urge you to continue to endow the Commission with power to determine what technology to deploy in our elections at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nINEC Releases Notice for Anambra Governorship Election\n\nMeanwhile, INEC yesterday, released the notice of the governorship election in Anambra State slated for November 6.\n\nWith this development, however, INEC said all the governorship candidates have been scheduled to sign a peace accord on November 4.\n\nA statement by the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye stated that, \u201cSo far, the Commission has successfully implemented 12 out of 14 activities in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has today published the Notice of Poll at its state and all the local government offices in Anambra State. By Section 46 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), the Commission shall, not later than 14 days before the day of the election, cause to be published, a notice specifying the date and hours fixed for the poll; the persons entitled to vote; and the location of the polling units.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, today is the last day for the submission of names of polling agents by political parties. By Section 45 of the Electoral Act, each political party may by notice in writing, addressed to the Electoral Officer of the local government, appoint a polling agent for each polling unit and collation centre.\n\n\u201cThe notice shall set out the name and address of the polling agent, accompanied by two passport photographs of each polling agent, and sample signature of the agent, at least, 14 days before the date fixed for the election. Political parties are strongly advised to adhere strictly to the law and the guidelines for the deployment of polling agents. Only duly accredited polling agents will be allowed to operate at the polling units and collation centres,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nAccordingly, the INEC national commissioner said he was satisfied with the current level of preparations, explaining that, \u201cVirtually all non-sensitive materials have been delivered in readiness for the election.\n\n\u201cThe training of ad-hoc staff is also going on as scheduled. The Commission is in touch with the National Peace Committee under the Chairmanship of former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (Rtd) GCFR. Preparations are underway for the signing of the Peace Accord in Awka on Thursday 4th November 2021.\u201d\n\nOkoye further said the commission noted with appreciation, the role of religious, traditional and community leaders in Anambra State as well as civil society, socio-cultural associations and the media in appealing for peace during electioneering campaign and election day activities.\n\nHe posited that with just a little over two weeks to the election, the Commission appealed for support from all and sundry in Anambra to ensure that the election was not only peaceful but also free, fair and credible.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The affected locomotive has been sent to the workshop for assessment and repairs.\n\n\u201cWe are also pleased to inform the public that there were no reported casualties or injuries to either the passengers or Train Crew.\n\n\u201cThe NRC management apologises for the inconveniences experienced last night and for the non-operations of the train services currently being experienced as we work towards restoration of normal services.\u201d\n\nThe Managing Director of the NRC, Engineer Fidet Okhiria, while speaking to newsmen earlier yesterday, had said: \u201cUnidentified persons detonate explosives on Abuja-Kaduna rail track, disrupt services, and this damaged the tracks.\n\n\u201cEfforts are currently ongoing to ensure that the train services along the Kaduna-Abuja route are fully restored,\u201d he added.\n\nBut, THISDAY had gathered that the Abuja-Kaduna train had developed fault about 40 kilometres into Kaduna after taking off from Idu terminal station, 6pm on Wednesday, and left passengers stranded for about 6hours.\n\nIt was learnt that the train reportedly developed fault around 8pm following a loud sound from the engine that caused the train to stop abruptly.\n\nHowever, narrating his account of the incident, Senator Shehu Sani who said was on board the Abuja-bound train, said passengers miraculously escaped death.\n\nSani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial Zone between 2015 to 2019, wrote on his social media pages (Facebook and Twitter), that the train ran over rails damaged by explosives and nearly skidded off track.\n\n\u201cThis early morning, I was on board when our train ran over another explosive damaged railings.\n\n\u201cThe train nearly skid off its track, then we miraculously escaped. All Kaduna -Abuja train operations need to be suspended for today until this issue is addressed,\u201d he said.\n\nSani also said a similar incident occurred on Wednesday night.\n\nHe said, \u201cLast night, bandits attacked the Kaduna-Abuja train. They planted an explosive that damaged the rail track and shattered the windshield of the train engine. They also opened fire, targeting the Driver and the tank. It happened between Dutse and Rijana stations.\n\n\u201cThe driver struggled to move towards Kaduna Rigasa station.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the spokesman of the Kaduna state police command, Mohammad Jalige, said he was not in a position to comment on the incident as the train service is under the Railway Police Command.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in charge of the Railway Command, Mr. Oyeyemi Adediran, also did not respond to several telephone calls when contacted.\n\nHowever, another passengers on board, Garba Muhammad who is the Regional Editor of News Express said: \u201cWe heard a loud sound from the locomotive engine, then the train gradually came to abrupt halt.\u201d He said there was pandemonium in the train after security men attached to VIP coaches shouted for all to take cover, adding that the lights and the air conditioning systems went off, leaving passengers in heat and darkness.\u201d\n\nMuhammad further said after the passengers were stranded in the bush for hours with palpable fears of being attacked by the bandits, another engine came around 12:15am and pushed the immobilised train to Rigasa, Kaduna.\n\nThe NRC had on Monday hinted that it would reduce the number of trips on the Abuja-Kaduna route from 19th to 21st October 2021 to carry out schedule maintenance.\n\nOkhiria had explained that the reduction in the number of trips was to carry out scheduled maintenance.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) revealed that the train was attacked by criminal elements.\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe while speaking yesterday, during the inauguration of the APC State Congresses Appeal Committees at the Party\u2019s National Secretariat described the action as despicable.\n\nHe stated: \u201cNigerians by now have realised that the APC led-government of President Muhammadu Buhari means well for Nigerians and is doing everything possible to deliver infrastructure to Nigerians amidst difficult economic times, globally.\n\n\u201cWe must stay united so we can defeat the agents of destruction who have vowed to set Nigeria backwards. Just this morning, an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train was attacked by criminals, depriving Nigerians the services it provides. This is so despicable, but together we shall overcome them.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FIRS Proposes Road Infrastructure Funding Scheme for Nigeria",
          "text": "Oluchi Chibuzor\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has said it is proposing the introduction of Road Infrastructure Tax in Nigeria, to make the informal sector contribute to building a modern society.\n\nThe Executive Chairman of FIRS, Muhammad Mamman Nami, disclosed this yesterday, while receiving a delegation of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, led by its National President, Chris Isiguzo, in his office, in Abuja.\n\nNami said the proposed Road Infrastructure Tax to be administered by the federal agency, would provide government with adequate funding for road construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance, as well as providing the needed security for roads in the country.\n\nAccording to the FIRS boss, \u201cone quick and very important intervention required of you is in the area of the Road Infrastructure Funding Scheme that the country needs in order to fix our roads and bring the informal sector to the tax net.\u201d\n\nHe noted that, \u201cin many jurisdictions, road users pay for the use of road infrastructure as such it shouldn\u2019t be seen as an additional burden on our citizens because it has the potential of making life better for all of us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Nami stated that Nigeria\u2019s economy presently relies heavily on non-oil revenues to discharge its statutory responsibility of paying salaries and providing social amenities to the citizenry.\n\nAccording to him, without payment of tax, governments at all levels would not be able to fulfil their mandate to the electorates.\n\nHe stressed that tax money also helps to ensure that the roads are safe and always in good conditions.\n\nHe disclosed that the recent rise in the price of crude oil ordinarily should have impacted positively on the Petroleum Profit Tax payable by oil producing companies. However, it has shown otherwise due to some reasons, he said.\n\nOn the challenges facing the service for delivering on its mandate, he said \u201cCrude oil production has been limited by OPEC quota. Nigeria\u2019s OPEC quota as at July 2021 was about 1.5mbpd as against its crude oil production budget of 1.8mbpd.\n\n\u201cThis is a shortfall of 300,000 barrels per day. Our average daily crude oil production is around 1.250mbpd as against the allocated 1.5mbpd OPEC quota which has resulted in a shortfall of almost 250,000 barrels per day mainly caused by crude oil theft and force majeure declared by some of the IOCs. The total shortfall to the federal government budgeted production is about 550,000 barrel per day.\n\n\u201cHuge losses brought forward and unrecouped capital allowances reported by most of the companies due to production shut in and the fall in oil price in 2020, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic which reduced their revenue.\u201d\n\nHe said with challenges in the oil and gas sector, reforms have been carried out by the agency that are visible on the economy. These he listed included the deployment of technology in tax administration to improve domestic revenue mobilisation in view of dwindling oil prices in order to avoid falling into debt crisis.\n\nNami added that the service created 10 Value Added Tax (VAT) Regional Coordination Offices across the country to drive collection of VAT.\n\n\u201cWe have commenced usage of VAT Form 002A for enrolment and tracking of branch offices of major VAT payers. This will certainly improve VAT our collection and capacity. We achieved 114.66 percent of our VAT collection target in the first half of the year.\n\n\u201cIt will interest you to know that the Service collected a total of N 4.2 trillion between January to September, 2021. This feat was achieved as a result of the efficiency and effectiveness of the TaxProMax Solution and intelligence/data we gathered, mined and analyzed in the period under review.\n\n\u201cThe Service successfully facilitated both the mock and external audits for the ISO 27001:2013 certification of the Exchange of Information (EOI) centre, to meet international information security management standards,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile congratulating Isiguzo for his recent reelection as the National President of NUJ, which was a reflection of his uncommon achievements at the NUJ, he urged NUJ Members\n\nEarlier, Isiguzo, said the visit of the union was part of his resolve to engage critical institutions as a key stakeholder in charting a way forward for the country\u2019s collective good.\n\nThe NUJ president described FIRS as a vital institution in the country, which, \u201crequires all the support it needs especially at a time when the country is security-challenged, adversely affected by Covid-19 and faced with FOREX crisis as well as political intrigues from different parts of the nation.\u201d\n\nHe said the NUJ has noted closely the FIRS\u2019 \u201cstrident efforts to shore up the country\u2019s revenue by deploying technology and the requisite personnel in this regard. Of interest to the Union is your digital technology solution, TaxPro-Max.\n\n\u201cThe numbers show that it has assisted in boosting efficiency in tax administration and collection rates across the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, with your recent admission that only about 44 million out of a possible 100 million plus that pay tax makes it urgent for a robust integrated media campaign to get more Nigerians into the tax net. This the NUJ is willing to spearhead.\u201d\n\nIsiguzo assured the FIRS boss and his management team that the NUJ would commend the agency where it has done noble.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Kyari: Why Nigeria Must Balance Financial, Energy Security",
          "text": "Peter Uzoho\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari has said Nigeria will not be cowed to jettison oil and gas, the nation\u2019s chief revenue earner, in the rush to achieve cleaner and sustainable energy.\n\nAccording to the NNPC boss, Nigeria must strike a balance between achieving financial security, a critical driver of the nation\u2019s survival as well as energy security and sustainability.\n\nThe GMD said this yesterday in Lagos, during his keynote address at the 2021 Energy Sustainability Conference (ESC) organised by the Energy Institute Nigeria, with the theme, \u201cAccelerating Sustainable Energy Solutions through Policy Implementation: Prospects and Limitations.\u201d\n\nRepresented at the event by the Group General Manager, National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), an arm of the NNPC, Mr. Bala Wunti, Kyari noted that such a balance was necessary considering the fact that Nigeria depends largely on income from oil and gas.\n\nWhile pointing out that oil and gas make up about 65 to 70 per cent of the country\u2019s revenue and almost 85 to 90 per cent of the foreign exchange (forex) coming to Nigeria, Kyari said it would be unwise for the country to abandon its main source of revenue just to achieve cleaner or sustainable energy.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe also know that oil and gas underpin our revenue, underpin our forex. Are we ready to exit 65 to 70 per cent of our revenue coming from oil and gas? Almost 85 to 90 per cent of our forex comes from oil and gas.\n\n\u201cIs Nigeria ready, because they want to have sustainable energy, cleaner energy, abandon this resource that we have and move to other ones?\n\n\u201cI think the solution is not to abandon them but to quickly monetise them and use the money to invest in other sectors, including cleaner and sustainable energy, so that we can have a credible replacement without compromising our financial security.\n\n\u201cSo the balance between financial security and energy security is a very critical national issue. I don\u2019t think there is any country in the world that will push you to the level where you create instability because you don\u2019t have the critical revenue,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said with Nigeria\u2019s 200 million population and the need to cater to their well being, it was important that policy makers try to put all factors including the peculiarities of countries into consideration while formulating the energy transition policy.\n\nKyari said while the developed and industrialised countries, who are the largest carbon emitting countries were calling for an end to fossil fuel, they were yet to tell the world how the world energy demand that is projected to balloon in the future would be met.\n\nHe stated that the policy of sustainability of energy must be decentralised, because what would work for other climes may not work for Africa.\n\nThe world\u2019s population, according to the recent report by the World Bank, stands at about 7.7 billion people while global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at $85 trillion.\n\nKyari pointed out that global energy consumption was in the neighbourhood of 3.1kwh, saying with the growing economic activities in the world, it was clear that energy demand was going to grow, a situation he said, called for a reflection on where the energy would be coming from.\n\nAccording to the GMD, the world currently consumes 27terabites of electricity and would double by 2050 to about 54.\n\n\u201cNow, the question is, where is this energy going to come from? This energy is going to come from a variety of sources, and the debate and the cordial invitation for all of us is that we would try to do what we call clean energy, sustainable energy, which are all wonderful.\n\n\u201cWe all want clean energy. Now, while trying to keep our eyes on making sure that we have sustainable energy, we also have to keep our eyes on making sure that we ensure our country\u2019s energy security.\n\n\u201cDefinition of energy security is around what we call the four As. That energy must be available to all and sundry, that energy must be accessed by everybody \u2013 accessibility is key; that energy must be affordable, if it is not affordable, then it\u2019s no longer available to me; and that energy finally, must be in an acceptable format and fashion,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, looking at all the four quadrants that constitute what energy security was, and the need to make it cleaner, presents a challenge for policy makers.\n\nHe, however, stated that the corporation was not averse to transition as it was already diversifying its portfolio, adding, \u201cWe need to bring everything to use -solar, wind, oil, gas, whatever we can, to make sure we achieve reasonable development through energy prosperity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Fresh Law Suits Loom For Nigerian Billionaire, Michael Adenuga After Refusing To Pay Multi-million Dollar Companies\u2019 Debts",
          "text": "Conpurex, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mike Adenuga\u2019s oil and gas conglomerate ConOil is being pursued by creditors for a combined debt of about $7 million by a foreign company and a local company.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Adenuga, chairman of Globacom, a telecommunications company in Nigeria, ranked fifth on the list of wealthy Africans with a net worth of $6.3 billion.\n\nWith this personal fortune, Adenuga Jr is very unlikely to be hurting for cash. However, for business partners to get the 68-year-old billionaire to pay off the company's debts is apparently proving to be an embarrassing issue, with Nigeria\u2019s second richest man once again being haunted over unpaid debts.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, ConOil was pursued by creditors for a debt of over $140.5 million owed to two foreign companies and one local company.\n\n\n\nFresh litigation is now looming over millions of dollars owed by Conpurex.\n\n\n\nDepthwize, a drilling contractor based in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State, says it is owed more than US$6,248,441.27 dollars ($6.2 million) by Conpurex, making it unable to pay its US partner Megadrill.\n\n\n\nWith the payment now more than 365 days overdue, Megadrill, has now hired New Orleans law firm, Jones Walker, to recover the funds from ConOil, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\n\n\nA letter by Attorney John Duveilh to Erekata Julius, Chief Financial Officer at ConOil: \u201cIt is not the desire of Megadrill or Depthwize to produce a drawn-out legal battle, but rather simply get paid for work already performed and contractually owed. However, if Conpurex refuses to meet their contractual obligations, and the amount is not paid immediately, Megadrill will be forced to take appropriate actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe letter dated August 18, 2021, further stated that the company will notify the Nigerian oil industry regulator, other international firms such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and Glencore, looking to do business with Conpurex that the latter is subject to ongoing legal action.\n\n\n\nIt also mentioned that it will seek court orders to seize assets including corporate and private bank accounts.\n\nIt said lawsuits could be filed in England and Nigeria, adding that it will notify other international firms - among them ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, Vitol, Total Trading and Glencore - looking to do business in that jurisdiction that it is subject to ongoing legal action\n\nIt also said it would seek \u201cadditional USD (US dollars) funds for violation of the contractual terms for the wrongful payment of Naira when USD should have been paid\u201d and \u201cseek all legal basis from securing assets through appropriate bank accounts\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Lagos headquarters of Depthwize also wrote to Conpurex to warn that the non-payment of its invoices is significantly hampering its operations, leaving it unable to renew the insurance cover on its assets.\n\n\n\nUche Dimiri, Depthwize\u2019s CEO, in the letter dated August 16 said: \u201cAs of today, we have a total of US$6,248,441.27 dollars due and unpaid ageing over 365 days.\n\n\n\n\u201cImportantly, and sadly so, as an organisation, we have been unable to renew the insurance cover on our operating assets because of a liquidity squeeze attributable in large parts to your non-payment of our invoices. We cannot overemphasize the negative impact this situation is having on our ongoing operations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in a further embarrassment to Adenuga, Megadrill and Depthwize are not alone in imploring ConOil to honour contracts.\n\n\n\nZukus Industries Limited, an oil and gas services contractor, has written to ConOil three times this year over outstanding invoices due from 2017 and 2018 totalling N317,750,268.09 (about $700, 000).\n\n\n\nChinye Uzor, Zukus\u2019s Managing Director, wrote to Sina Olinade, ConOil\u2019s Commercial Manager, in March, August, and September 2021.\n\nIts first letter of March 3, 2021, signed by Uzor and addressed to the Managing Director, Con Oil Producing Limited, is titled: \u2018Demand For Payment of Outstanding Invoices.\u2019\n\nIt read, \u201cOur letter dated 13th November with reference no: ZIL/WAR/093; 5th August 2019 with reference no: ZIL/WAR/093/19; mail of 30th May 2019; mail of 15th October 2019, letter dated 5th February 2020 with reference no: ZIL/WAR/1033/20 and several phone calls refers (Copies of letters attached as Appendices II-VI).\n\n\u201cWe write to request for payment of our outstanding invoices long overdue for payment from 13/12/2017 to 08/12/2018, totalling Three Hundred and Seventeen Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand, Two Hundred and Sixty-Eight Naira Nine Kobo (N317,750,268.09) only.\n\n\u201cWhen needed without failure, we have offered to your company; community settlements were promptly handled for speedy execution of jobs. The delay in prompt payment of these bills has had a tremendous effect on our operations.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Fresh Law Suits Loom For Nigerian Billionaire, Michael Adenuga After Refusing To Pay Multi-million Dollar Companies\u2019 Debts",
          "text": "Conpurex, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mike Adenuga\u2019s oil and gas conglomerate ConOil is being pursued by creditors for a combined debt of about $7 million by a foreign company and a local company.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Adenuga, chairman of Globacom, a telecommunications company in Nigeria, ranked fifth on the list of wealthy Africans with a net worth of $6.3 billion.\n\nWith this personal fortune, Adenuga Jr is very unlikely to be hurting for cash. However, for business partners to get the 68-year-old billionaire to pay off the company's debts is apparently proving to be an embarrassing issue, with Nigeria\u2019s second richest man once again being haunted over unpaid debts.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, ConOil was pursued by creditors for a debt of over $140.5 million owed to two foreign companies and one local company.\n\n\n\nFresh litigation is now looming over millions of dollars owed by Conpurex.\n\n\n\nDepthwize, a drilling contractor based in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State, says it is owed more than US$6,248,441.27 dollars ($6.2 million) by Conpurex, making it unable to pay its US partner Megadrill.\n\n\n\nWith the payment now more than 365 days overdue, Megadrill, has now hired New Orleans law firm, Jones Walker, to recover the funds from ConOil, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\n\n\nA letter by Attorney John Duveilh to Erekata Julius, Chief Financial Officer at ConOil: \u201cIt is not the desire of Megadrill or Depthwize to produce a drawn-out legal battle, but rather simply get paid for work already performed and contractually owed. However, if Conpurex refuses to meet their contractual obligations, and the amount is not paid immediately, Megadrill will be forced to take appropriate actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe letter dated August 18, 2021, further stated that the company will notify the Nigerian oil industry regulator, other international firms such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and Glencore, looking to do business with Conpurex that the latter is subject to ongoing legal action.\n\n\n\nIt also mentioned that it will seek court orders to seize assets including corporate and private bank accounts.\n\nIt said lawsuits could be filed in England and Nigeria, adding that it will notify other international firms - among them ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, Vitol, Total Trading and Glencore - looking to do business in that jurisdiction that it is subject to ongoing legal action\n\nIt also said it would seek \u201cadditional USD (US dollars) funds for violation of the contractual terms for the wrongful payment of Naira when USD should have been paid\u201d and \u201cseek all legal basis from securing assets through appropriate bank accounts\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Lagos headquarters of Depthwize also wrote to Conpurex to warn that the non-payment of its invoices is significantly hampering its operations, leaving it unable to renew the insurance cover on its assets.\n\n\n\nUche Dimiri, Depthwize\u2019s CEO, in the letter dated August 16 said: \u201cAs of today, we have a total of US$6,248,441.27 dollars due and unpaid ageing over 365 days.\n\n\n\n\u201cImportantly, and sadly so, as an organisation, we have been unable to renew the insurance cover on our operating assets because of a liquidity squeeze attributable in large parts to your non-payment of our invoices. We cannot overemphasize the negative impact this situation is having on our ongoing operations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in a further embarrassment to Adenuga, Megadrill and Depthwize are not alone in imploring ConOil to honour contracts.\n\n\n\nZukus Industries Limited, an oil and gas services contractor, has written to ConOil three times this year over outstanding invoices due from 2017 and 2018 totalling N317,750,268.09 (about $700, 000).\n\n\n\nChinye Uzor, Zukus\u2019s Managing Director, wrote to Sina Olinade, ConOil\u2019s Commercial Manager, in March, August, and September 2021.\n\nIts first letter of March 3, 2021, signed by Uzor and addressed to the Managing Director, Con Oil Producing Limited, is titled: \u2018Demand For Payment of Outstanding Invoices.\u2019\n\nIt read, \u201cOur letter dated 13th November with reference no: ZIL/WAR/093; 5th August 2019 with reference no: ZIL/WAR/093/19; mail of 30th May 2019; mail of 15th October 2019, letter dated 5th February 2020 with reference no: ZIL/WAR/1033/20 and several phone calls refers (Copies of letters attached as Appendices II-VI).\n\n\u201cWe write to request for payment of our outstanding invoices long overdue for payment from 13/12/2017 to 08/12/2018, totalling Three Hundred and Seventeen Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand, Two Hundred and Sixty-Eight Naira Nine Kobo (N317,750,268.09) only.\n\n\u201cWhen needed without failure, we have offered to your company; community settlements were promptly handled for speedy execution of jobs. The delay in prompt payment of these bills has had a tremendous effect on our operations. We are going through intense periods owing to our inability to meet up with creditors\u2019 indebtedness and bank loan repayment.\u201d\n\nZukus Industries Limited\u2019s second letter to ConOil in 2021 also stressed the need for the latter to pay its debt, adding that the \u201coutstanding covers the work done by Zukus Industries Limited for ConOil Producing Limited between 2017 and 2018, as far back as four years ago\u201d.\n\nIt said the job was handled professionally, adding that it is \u201cnow at a loss as to why payments of these monies owed to us are being withheld\u201d.\n\nIn the third and final demand, he told Mr Olinade: \u201cThis will be our third and final demand to ConOil Producing Limited for the full payment of our total outstanding of Three Hundred and Seventeen Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand, Two Hundred and Sixty-Eight Naira Nine Kobo (N317, 650, 268.09).\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that in the event of non-payment: \u201cOur attempts to recover the funds will be broad in scope, which is why we must insist that our warning in this letter is taken with the utmost seriousness.\n\nLitigation Letters Aden Uga by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nWe expect payment to be made promptly.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe situation has become such a concern to Total that its CEO Mike Sangster wrote to Adenuga personally on March 22, 2021, to request a meeting.

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of crypto-salaries?",
          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, the BBC Insider Series hosted a few players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector during a panel discussion to discuss strides made by the sector to aid innovation and financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nModerated by BBC presenter, Zeinab Badawi, the panel had Olugbenga Agboola, founder and CEO of Flutterwave, Usoro Usoro, CEO, Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services, MTN\u2019s fintech subsidiary, Bola Asiru, Principal/Divisional Lead, sub-Saharan Africa for Mastercard Advisors, and Yasmin Masithela, Managing Executive, Transactional Banking, Absa Corporate and Investment Banking.\n\nThe virtual event focused on fintech\u2019s allure to investors, the benefits Africans derive from fintech start-ups, partnerships between banks and fintech startups, and the role of regulators in the industry.\n\nDiscussing fintech\u2019s attractiveness to investors, the panelists were unanimous in their agreement that the scale of opportunity available to players in the fintech industry was a big factor in why investors are taken in by fintech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Foundation, as of 2017, about 43% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa were financially included. This presents a huge opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the myriad of challenges that they are sure to face to build solutions.\n\nHowever, for Usoro, beyond the scale, the unserved segment of the market represents a huge opportunity as well. \u201cWhen we look at the market segment, you look at a lot of people that are unserved and when you look at the served segment, they\u2019re still lots of people that have not adopted the services. So it\u2019s both scale and the fact that a lot of people are still unserved that makes the market very attractive.\u201d\n\nWith the speed of innovation and execution exhibited by fintech, arguments have been made regarding fintech\u2019s potential to replace traditional banks. However, Agboola disagreed with that view, arguing that he sees a situation where fintech complement the works that banks do and vice versa, advocating for partnerships between banks and fintech.\n\nEven with the gains recorded, there is still a long way to go for fintech to plug the gaps in financial inclusion in Africa. For this Usoro argued that fintech in addition to providing a huge opportunity for investors also do good in the communities where they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s commercially attractive to investors but it also does some social good.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the kind of services that we offer to customers, whether it\u2019s those micro-loans that enable SMEs to access inventory on daily basis, a lot of these services actually transform the lives of our customers.\u201d He added that with innovations in USSD technology and the adoption of agent banking networks, fintech are able to make it easier for most users to access financial services.\n\nDeepening financial inclusion is high on the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank and Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services has been playing its part in helping the apex realize this goal. With its wide network of over 150,000 MoMo agents, the organization offers financial services to customers.\n\nCustomers can pay bills, deposit and withdraw cash, as well as purchase data and airtime from agents.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2020, as the coronavirus swept through cities and triggered lockdowns in many countries, Toyin Akintayo asked himself, \u201cWhat can give small businesses an edge against bigger ones?\u201d\n\nWhy small businesses? For Akintayo, the idea to work with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) stems from his two decades of running small businesses.\n\nAlthough most of them failed, some succeeded. Currently, he runs Gift People, a delivery business, which, of course, uses his solution. As he laughingly tells Techpoint Africa, \u201cOf course you have to use your technology so that you know what the customers are feeling.\u201d\n\nSMEs account for 96% of businesses in Nigeria, providing 80% of the country\u2019s jobs. In the past five years, they\u2019ve contributed up to 50% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the ease of doing business is a challenge. As of 2019, Nigeria ranked 131 out of 190 on the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business Index, which is based on how conducive the regulatory environment is and stronger protection of property rights, among others.\n\nAkintayo says, \u201cIt\u2019s tough to do business in Nigeria. Every small business owner is struggling. Struggling in terms of capital, operations, and infrastructure. My experience and my engagement with quite a number of small business owners taught me this.\u201d\n\nAnd it was at this point that he arrived at his answer: digitising small businesses. The idea of BIZ301 was formed, and \u201cThat was how the journey began,\u201d he recalls.\n\nThe journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIZ301 team at an event in Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria. Source: Supplied\n\nMost startup owners wax eloquently about how important a team is to the company. Beyond startups, a good team is always a recipe for success in any venture, and Akintayo began the journey by assembling his team.\n\n\u201cSo I began to look at the areas of operation of small businesses? At this point, I sat at the drawing table and tried to understand the exact structure of small businesses. So I put together my team and said, \u2018Guys, we need to figure out how we can help small businesses in every aspect of their operation.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe journey to the actual launch, however, involved months of iteration and careful planning. From March 2020 to March 2021, Akintayo and his team worked on what would become BIZ301.\n\nIn the days between March and May 2021, after launching the platform in Beta, the company says it onboarded its first 100 SMEs, a number Akintayo says has doubled since its full launch in June 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is simply through two methods: word of mouth and referrals from existing customers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA strategy that he reveals is deliberate.\n\nBut what does BIZ301 do?\n\nA suite of operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIZ301 applications\n\nTo explain how BIZ301 works, Akintayo uses the example of one of its customers.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we have a customer who just delivers bread. He used to use manual invoices, but it was beginning to give him headaches. So we introduced BIZ301 to him.\n\n\u201cNow, when he gets to a customer, he issues them an e-invoice, and it records online. So when they make payments, it automatically updates, and reconciliation is made easy for him.\u201d\n\nWith a staff strength of three people \u2014 owner, driver, and marketer \u2014 Akintayo says he generates over 1,000 invoices monthly from over 30 supermarkets.\n\nBut beyond issuing e-invoices, the company offers a suite of operations. The platform currently has six applications that cut across four aspects of a business: sales, operations, human resources, and marketing.\n\nUsers can now access the finance, invoices, employee and payroll management, expense and budgeting management, helpdesk, and facility management applications. With the employee and payroll function, the business owner automates the salary payment process.\n\nIf a business offers after-sales support, the helpdesk application would be beneficial. To explain this, Akintayo explains this using another customer example.\n\n\u201cSo, this company has multiple outlets, and they have issues reported from those locations daily. So what they did was, rather than the WhatsApp messages they were using, they signed up on our platform and used the helpdesk application.\n\n\u201cWhat that does is, all the reports from the different outlets come to a central point at the head office. So once they log in, they can see what the Abule Egba branch is complaining about. They need this and this; same goes for other branches.\u201d\n\nUnlike WhatsApp, which would require a lot of scrolling, all the user has to do is filter by date or keyword. And there are no limits to the number of inquiries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIZ301 website\n\nWhile all applications can be used as standalones, they can also be interwoven. Using the bread supplier as an example once again, Akintayo says,\n\n\u201cIf his business grows in another six months or another one year, and the number of staff increases, we will introduce our employee and payroll management to him.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to help business owners piece together the fragmented aspects of their business on one platform.\n\nAkintayo says the company caters for all aspects of the business. So, instead of using three or four different apps, all the user does is sign in on one platform where they can easily see everything going on in the business at once.\n\nAnd with the ability to onboard employees, this eliminates the issue of calling in to get reports, reducing time wasted and possible errors.\n\nThe first user licence is free for life. So a sole-practitioner can sign on to use the service without paying but would have to pay to onboard subsequent users.\n\n\u201cAs your business grows, we want to grow with you.\u201d\n\nThe business owner pays \u20a61,000 per user every month for other user licences, so it works as a subscription model.\n\nBut how is BIZ301 funded?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company is currently completely self-funded. But the idea is to bootstrap the startup for as long as possible, and Akintayo explains why.\n\n\u201cWe want to offer a competitive price. We see Zoho as our biggest competitor because they are also looking at the market now, as the African market is ripe. It\u2019s going to be very tough to be competitive if we get external funding.\n\nTo keep prices low, Akintayo says the company has \u201cgone back to school,\u201d employing mostly university students \u2014 70% of BIZ301\u2019s workforce.\n\n\u201cThe moment we collect investors\u2019 money, we will be under pressure to jack up our prices and deliver value. So we want to be self-funded.\u201d\n\nTo better understand, Techpoint asked if BIZ301 would be open to funding if he finds an investor with the same values. In response, Akintayo said that it would still be a hard sell, citing experiences of friends who accepted investor money and began to face pressure.\n\nPressing further, we asked if this would still hold true in, say, two, three years, and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s look at it case by case. In two, three years, we can evaluate the situation again. There are some core principles it must not affect, like pricing and the value we offer. As I speak, we want to remain the way we are.\u201d\n\nAccording to Akintayo, the idea is to help businesses grow while easing business costs.\n\n\u201cThe guy is already spending a lot, paying for the shop, bringing in products, and paying the staff. We are not going to place a huge burden by also saying, \u2018Okay, pay this amount of money for the software that would help you integrate every aspect of your business to one platform.\u2019\u201d\n\nA not for profit?\n\nWhile the goal is altruistic, BIZ301 is still a profit-seeking venture. Apart from the subscription-based model of user licences, the company earns a commission on transactions.\n\nFor example, when a user issues an invoice and gets paid, the company takes a commission \u2014 \u20a6100 \u2014 of the amount. So even on a free user licence, a business owner still pays some money. A freemium model, so to speak.\n\nUsing the payroll application as another example, the company collects a payroll administration fee. This means that, for every employee salary paid through the platform, BIZ301 gets \u20a6150. So if you have three employees, the startup earns \u20a6450.\n\nAs long as the small business owner is making money, BIZ301 makes money too, free user licence or not.\n\nPresent challenges; future conquests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Supplies\n\nWith a team of seven, Akintayo says the biggest challenge currently is slow onboarding due to a lack of technical know-how.\n\n\u201cPeople are not as tech-savvy as we think. A lot of these people are not our peers and may not understand how to use this application. I don\u2019t want people just signing up, and they are not using it. I want to onboard people and show them how to integrate different parts of their operation.\u201d\n\nA challenge that he says he is willing to take on and hopes the work being put in now would translate into more revenue in the long run.\n\n\u201cOrganic growth is critical at this stage we are in, so we are using word of mouth and referrals deliberately rather than doing a lot of publicity and advertising, and we are okay with it.\u201d\n\nCurrently, he has a short-term plan, which he hopes to execute in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve earmarked about eight cities in Nigeria that are critical for us. People are signing up, but we need someone on the ground who will provide that hand-holding, and we are looking at the next six months.\u201d\n\nAn ambitious project, to be sure. The eight cities are Port Harcourt, Kaduna, Ibadan, Kano, Abuja, Awka, Ilorin, and its current base, Lagos.\n\nOver the next 36 months, he hopes to be in 10 African countries and says groundwork is already being done in three of them. An endeavour Akintayo believes is doable based on previous successes.\n\nAnd although he says the business management space in Africa is nascent, he welcomes more players. Still, he decries the challenges of inconsistent tech policies, which he calls reactive rather than proactive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to look at what has been done in more developed climes. Sit down and ask yourself, \u2018What can we adapt, what changes can we make to get this to work?\u2019 The government needs to create idea-enabling policies, so the tech space grows.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrolling through Twitter a few days ago, something caught my eye. It started a chain of reactions culminating in a midnight call and a new story idea for this month\u2019s Privacy Roundtable.\n\nOn Friday, October 15, 2021, we sent out a tweet asking readers to fill a form for a story on why they do not care about privacy. As you might have already guessed, today\u2019s article has gone off on a tangent. And for this, I apologise to everyone. We will talk about it in next month\u2019s edition.\n\nWhile you are here, please populate the form with your answers.\n\nFor today\u2019s story, our focus would be on data privacy rights and possible exceptions. I paint a picture in the following paragraphs that guides this article\u2019s narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAda is a 24-year-old graduate with a theatre arts degree. If there\u2019s one thing she loves, it\u2019s talking to her friends on the phone. She could spend the whole day doing that. Perhaps, that\u2019s why she\u2019s unemployed.\n\nA few days ago, she saw a trending post on Twitter about this new fintech app that allows you to send money as airtime to anyone with a tag. Expectedly, she jumped on the train because she always needs airtime since she spends all day talking on the phone.\n\nLike most of us, without reading the terms and conditions or the company\u2019s privacy policy, Ada downloads and installs the app and chooses the tag \u2018adda\u2019. Of course, she immediately sends this to her friends and asks them to download the app so they can send her airtime anytime.\n\nToday, though, Ada has a problem. While trying to send her airtime, her friend mistakenly sent it to a user with a similar but slightly different tag; this user has an underscore (_) at the end of theirs.\n\nAda is distraught and decides she wants to change her tag to something unique but still identifiable by her friends. She goes on the app and tries to change her tag but is told she cannot. Now, she\u2019s angry. Why can\u2019t she change her tag? It\u2019s hers, after all.\n\nThe issues\n\nUnder the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation 2019, a data subject has several rights over the use of their personal data. These include the right to transparent information relating to the processing of data and prior information before data processing.\n\nIt also includes the right to erasure, rectification and restriction of data, and the right to move your data to another platform, among several others.\n\nAda has the right to know extensively how her personal information is being handled and when it is handled. She can also choose to delete, correct, or restrict access to that data. If she wishes to move her personal information on that particular app to another with similar functions, she can do that too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s not as cut and dried as this, and this brings me to the idea behind this story.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big idea?\n\nA Twitter thread caught my eye two days ago; it went something like this,\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change your Abeg tag or your name on the Abeg App. You can\u2019t also delete your account on the app.\n\n\u201cThis is in breach of the Nigerian Data Protection Regulations which protects the right of a data subject to rectification and erasure of their personal data.\u201d\n\nYou can't change your Abeg tag or your name on the Abeg App. You can't also delete your account on the app.\n\n\n\nThis is in breach of the Nigerian Data Protection Regulations which protects the right of a data subject to rectification and erasure of their personal data. \u2014 Equivocator (@Oluwanonso_Esq) October 18, 2021\n\nThis Twitter user, a lawyer with the handle, @Oluwanonso_Esq, then proceeded to share a screenshot of the conversation between him and an Abeg Customer Service Agent, L\u00f9, on the startup\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nL\u00f9 told him that he could not change his Abeg tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the conversation between @Oluwanonso_Esq and L\u00f9\n\nTwo questions come to mind. Is this usual with fintechs? Is there truly a problem here?\n\nIs this an isolated incident?\n\nI currently have several fintech apps on my phone. So, I decided to do a little investigation using the ones I could access.\n\nUsing Roqqu, Cowrywise, Risevest, Piggyvest, Accrue, and Barter as case studies, I tried to find answers.\n\nOn Roqqu, I found that I could not change the name associated with my account.\n\nCowrywise allows you to change your name and unique tag.\n\nRisevest and Piggyvest require you to send their support team an email.\n\nBarter does not allow you to change your name, but you can change your handle.\n\nIs there really a problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Iwaria\n\nTo better understand if this was indeed a problem, I spoke with Nigerian lawyer, Motunrayo Ope-Ogunseitan, to get a general idea of possible defences in a similar scenario.\n\nShe said there might be different reasons why a company would not allow an individual to change their data on its platform. The first is what she called the \u201cStartup Syndrome.\u201d This means the company is probably not paying attention to complying with the NDPR and is basically trying to get going as soon as possible.\n\nThe other reason she gave was that there might be a legitimate defence to such an action. Why? All laws have exceptions. A good example is the right to freedom of movement as contained in the Nigerian Constitution and the abrogation of that right in a state of emergency or when a crime is committed.\n\n\u201cMy best bet would probably be that such companies would say, \u2018Oh, we cannot allow you to frequently go on the app and delete your personal data or amend it because it may compromise the interests of other people.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut she also said this defence would need to be looked at on a case by case basis as all companies might not be able to rely on the same defence.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the startup app might be philanthropic, to give or provide for people who are in need. So imagine a situation where I get some money, I change my profile details, and I enter another giveaway and keep amassing a lot of money when the money is actually supposed to reach as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOr a scenario where someone credits my verified account with a huge sum of money to assist with sharing it and I just delete my account or deactivate and go offline. Given the nature of the app, considering the fact that it\u2019s largely a financial platform, you shouldn\u2019t just allow people to modify their data. There\u2019s a higher standard of care involved.\u201d\n\nBut she advised companies to communicate these decisions to users.\n\nAnother thing she referred to is the golden rule of interpretation in law. This rule states that a law could be interpreted to show the spirit or the intent of the law rather than a literal interpretation.\n\n\u201cIn as much as it provides for these rights, they don\u2019t necessarily tell the companies how to achieve it. The laws don\u2019t say the right to rectification of data by the data subject must be done on the platform by the individual, or it must be achieved immediately.\n\n\u201cAs a platform provider, I can say, \u2018Oh yes, you have a right, but you just can\u2019t do it yourself and randomly.\u2019 And that\u2019s why a lot of companies just say, \u2018You have a right to delete your data, amend your data. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us by email.\u2019 They won\u2019t necessarily allow you to just do it directly on the platform.\u201d\n\nEssentially, while the right still exists, it cannot be exercised haphazardly.\n\nThe NDPR provides for situations that might be regarded as the lawful processing of a data subject\u2019s data. Article 2.2 of the Regulations says at least one of the following must have occurred:\n\nThe Data Subject has given consent to the processing of his or her Personal Data for one or more specific purposes,\n\nprocessing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract,\n\nprocessing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject,\n\nprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person, and\n\nprocessing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in exercise of official public mandate vested in the controller.\n\nLike we explained here, a data controller is any person, organisation, or body that receives and controls an individual\u2019s data. The data controller determines the purpose and means of data processing.\n\nCombining Motunrayo\u2019s words and the provisions of the NDPR, if the company provides a way to ensure the right is exercised or falls under the exceptions listed in Article 2.2, the data subject\u2019s rights have not been tampered with.\n\nUsing Ada\u2019s scenario, if the startup has an option to contact the company\u2019s support person for help to rectify her tag, then her rights as a data subject are still being protected.\n\nOr you could think of it this way. Facebook only allows you to change your name once every 90 days. While you still have the right to rectify your data, it just takes longer.\n\nMuch ado about nothing?\n\nYesterday, October 20, 2021, Abeg replied to @Oluwanonso_Esq\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cHi Nonso, thank you for stating your concerns, however, it is possible to change your Abeg tag and delete your Abeg account by contacting our support team at hello@abeg.app.\n\n\u201cThese measures were put in place for security reasons for the initial rollout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making some adjustments and all users will be able to deactivate and change their names without having to reach customer service.\u201d\n\nHi Nonso, thank you for stating your concerns however, it is possible to change your Abegtag and delete your abeg account by contacting our support team at hello@abeg.app.\n\n\n\nThese measures were put in place for security reasons for the initial rollout. \u2014 Abeg (@abeg_app) October 20, 2021\n\nThis can also be seen on Abeg\u2019s website in the FAQ section.\n\nSo why did the customer support agent on Instagram tell Nonso he couldn\u2019t change his tag? Did they mean to say only on the app? I don\u2019t know.\n\nBut what I do know is that it has prompted a very important discussion on data rights and how they can be abrogated.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered a massive deployment of security agents in Anambra State to ensure peaceful conduct of the November 6 governorship election in the state.\n\nNational Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, disclosed this to journalists after a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) at the State House, Abuja on Thursday.\n\nThe meeting was presided over by Mr Buhari.\n\nThere has been an upsurge of violent activities in Anambra in the past months, leading to the death of some persons and destruction of properties.\n\nApart from the killings, the facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other government agencies have also been attacked, thereby threatening the peaceful conduct of the governorship poll.\n\nThe attacks have been linked to the proscribed IPOB and its militant wing, ESN.\n\nMr Monguno, a retired major general, said NCS observed that non-state actors had made attempts to frustrate the smooth conduct of the polls, following their violent activities in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s meeting of the National Security Council focused its attention on several issues, primarily the elections in Anambra State, which will be held on the 6th of November,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCouncil observed recent trends in which a lot of violent activities have been taking place and Council is desirous of seeing a hitch-free election being conducted by next month.\n\n\u201cNow the problem here is that in as much as the government wants to conduct peaceful elections, there are non-state actors who have been heating up the polity, who have made all kinds of attempts to stymie orderly elections for next month.\n\n\u201cThe president has directed that under no circumstances will anything be allowed to stop the elections from taking place successfully. The people have a right to vote, they have a right to select their leader, and no group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos leading to murderous activities.\n\n\u201cThe president has made it very clear that the armed forces, security agencies and law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place, if it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\u201d\n\nMr Monguno said there are implications if the governorship poll is sabotaged by the non-state actors.\n\nAccording to him, if they succeed in stopping the election, other parts of the country would want to follow suit to stop future elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors. In the first place, we\u2019re in a democracy. Secondly, it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potential for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country will also want to copy this situation.\n\n\u201cSecondly, it\u2019s not something that President Buhari will even contemplate in a situation in which he is boxed into a corner. The mere thought that a group of non-state actors want to portray his government as not being able to be firm is totally out of the question. The tail can\u2019t wag the dog, it is totally unacceptable, and again, we in the security and intelligence community have been trying as much as possible to talk with the leadership in the Southeast, to make them aware of the fact that\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is not averse to the aspirations of the people of the South-east, so long as whatever they desire to achieve, they do it through the normal prescribed manner, either legislative, legal, or whatever.\n\n\u201cFor as long as it is within the confines of legitimacy, President Buhari does not have a problem with that. But any action that is outlandish, any action that typifies roguery, the usurpation of the authority of the state is not going to be tolerated.\n\n\u201cAgain, we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that Nigerians, being what they are, also need to understand that if these non-state actors should go out on a limb and extend the frontiers of violence, and begin to kill people, there is a possibility that reprisal attacks can take place in other parts of the country, which is what we do not want to happen. So, we\u2019re working with the community leaders, with the governors and everybody to ensure that they bring their people, restrain them on the leash.\u201d\n\nOther security measures\n\nThe police on 14 October announced it would deploy 34,587 personnel to Anambra to ensure peace during the poll.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, said the deployment would consist of conventional police officers, Police Mobile Force, the Counter-Terrorism Unit, Special Forces, Explosive Ordnance Unit, Force Intelligence Bureau, INTERPOL, Special Protection Unit and a medical team.\n\nHe said three helicopters would be deployed for aerial surveillance while detachments of Marine Police operatives would also be deployed to ensure a safe, secure and credible electoral process.\n\nMr Baba had earlier deployed a new commissioner of police to Anambra State, after a spate of deadly gun attacks in the South-east state. The new commissioner is Echeng Echeng.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, had hinted that the federal government was considering imposing a state of emergency in the state to ensure peaceful conduct of the poll.\n\n\u201cAnd you cannot rule out possibilities inclusive of the possibility of declaration of state of emergency where it is established, in essence, that there is a failure on the part of the state government to ensure the sanctity of security of lives, properties and democratic order.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cSo, our position as a government is; election is going to hold, necessary security in terms of democratic order most certainly prevail for the purpose of this election,\u2019\u2019 the minister said.\n\nBut after a meeting with Mr Buhari at the State House, Abuja the following day, the governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, told journalists that the president was against the declaration of a state of emergency in the south-eastern state.\n\n\u201cI just finished meeting with the president and I mentioned it and the president didn\u2019t suggest that. The president is firm, he wants a peaceful election in Anambra State. He wants a free and fair election in Anambra State, that\u2019s the president for you.\n\n\u201cBut if people in his party are going around making insinuations, using his name to do things, the president clearly told me that he does not support that, full stop,\u201d Mr Obiano said.",

But we could have solved the problem 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nDokpesi, said that Nigeria\u2019s growth and development would be realized only if political leaders could create new economic opportunities, and transform the society.\n\nHe also stressed that the issues of insecurity, the infrastructure deficit, internet affordability and access, broadband connection speed, digital literacy, digital and technical skills gap, and gender biases in the technology industry must also be addressed for the nation to advance.",

          "text": "The government of France, through the French Development Agency/Agence Francaise de Developement (AFD), has agreed to invest $70 million into renewable energy projects in Nigeria.\n\nThis is according to Mr Chukwudumije Igwe, Member, Project and Structured Finance, Sub Sahara Africa, Access Bank, at the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Energy Finance (SUNREF) Nigeria programme investor conference on Thursday in Lagos.\n\nAccording to Igwe, the $70 million fund will be disbursed to renewable energy stakeholders through Access Bank Plc and United Bank for Africa (UBA).\n\nIgwe disclosed that the fund would be used to boost investment into Nigeria\u2019s renewable energy space and help fight pollution, adding that SUNREF was committed to sponsoring projects that were innovative, energy-efficient and renewable in the continent.\n\n\u201cSUNREF is a fund that has been made available by AFD to back renewable and energy-efficient projects,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cAccess bank is one of the disbursing banks and we are looking forward to reviewing and accessing projects that meet eligibility and also the risk criteria.\n\n\u201cThe total size of the fund is 70 million U.S dollars and has been shared between Access Bank and UBA and we are looking for eligible projects to disburse this fund to.\n\n\u201cWe know that a lot of the SUNREF project are power and renewable projects and we know how critical infrastructure is to Nigeria and the federal government cannot do it alone.\n\n\u201cThe private sector is key and we also know that bridging this gap would involve private sector and development finance institutions.\n\n\u201cThis is why this is very critical and we hope that the fund would bridge a whole lot of the nation\u2019s infrastructure gap,\u201d he said.\n\nTeam Lead, SUNREF Nigeria, Mr Javier Betancourt, stated that the 70 million U.S dollars was largely not enough, but a start because what Nigeria needed was in billions, adding that over 80 million people in Nigeria were completely un-electrified while the remaining 100 million were somewhat electrified.\n\n\u201cThe investment needed is enormous and $70 million does not even begin to cover it, but it does help start things\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis fund we are bringing in will be longer terms with minimum of five years and these are concessional lending rates which would help to finance these projects.\u201d\n\nHe added that it would be difficult to approximate the exact amount the country needed for the renewable sector to bridge the nation\u2019s energy gap, but stated that Nigeria needed another 14GW of energy, an investment of about $10 billion in total.\n\n\u201c$70 million is a drop in the ocean, but it is an important drop because it will help move this sector to get the appropriate finance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otuba Adeniyi Adebayo, added that the rapid population growth and increase in industrial activities had led to a significant increase in energy consumption, resulting in increase in environmental pollution and economic difficulties.\n\n\u201cRenewable energy provides assess to alternative sources of energy that are more sustainable and reduce dependence on fossil fuels,\u201d he said",

She was flown to hospital by helicopter but sadly died of injuries sustained.\n\nThe movie director, Joel Souza, who got injured on the set at Bonanza Creek Ranch was taken to hospital by ambulance.\n\nAccording to BBC, Police were still investigating and no charges have been filed yet.\n\nSpeaking to AP News Agency, the spokesman for the famous actor, Mr Baldwin, said that the incident involved the misfiring of a prop gun with blanks.\n\n\u201cHe came in voluntarily and he left the building after he finished his interviews,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nMr Baldwin is a co-producer of the film and plays its namesake, an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter.\n\nIn a statement, the International Cinematographer\u2019s Guild said Ms Hutchins\u2019 death was \u201cdevastating news\u201d and \u201ca terrible loss\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe details are unclear at this moment, but we are working to learn more, and we support a full investigation into this tragic event,\u201d said guild president, John Lindley and executive director Rebecca Rhine.\n\nHutchins who hails from Ukraine, grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to her personal website, she studied journalism in Kyiv, and film in Los Angeles, and was named a \u201crising star\u201d by the American Cinematographer magazine in 2019.\n\nMs Hutchins was the director of photography for the 2020 action film Archenemy, directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer.\n\nAccording to the Police, Sheriff\u2019s deputies were dispatched to Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular filming location, at around 13:50 local time (19:50 GMT) after receiving an emergency call about a shooting on the set of Rust.\n\nThursday\u2019s shooting on the movie set of Rust was rare, but seldom happen.\n\nReal firearms are often used in filming, and are loaded with blanks \u2013 cartridges that create a flash and a bang without discharging a projectile.\n\nActor, Alec Baldwin, who was seen in tears after the ugly incident, is the eldest of four brothers, all actors. Mr Baldwin has starred in numerous TV and film roles since the 1980s.",

One defendant remains at large.\n\nThis is according to the United States Department of Justice.\n\nThe suspects are:\n\nPerry Osagiede, aka \u201cLord Sutan Abubakar de 1st,\u201d aka \u201cRob Nicolella,\u201d aka \u201cAlan Salomon,\u201d 52;\n\nEnorense Izevbigie, aka \u201cRichy Izevbigie,\u201d aka \u201cLord Samuel S Nujoma,\u201d 45;\n\nFranklyn Edosa Osagiede, aka, \u201cLord Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela,\u201d aka, \u201cEdosa Franklyn Osagiede,\u201d aka \u201cDave Hewitt,\u201d aka, \u201cBruce Dupont,\u201d 37;\n\nOsariemen Eric Clement, aka, \u201cLord Adekunle Ajasi,\u201d aka, \u201cAiden Wilson,\u201d 35;\n\nCollins Owhofasa Otughwor, aka, \u201cLord Jesse Makoko,\u201d aka, \u201cPhilip Coughlan,\u201d 37; and\n\nMusa Mudashiru, aka \u201cLord Oba Akenzua,\u201d 33.\n\nThe men were arrested on Tuesday as part of a joint operation by the FBI, Hawks and the US Secret Service.\n\nThey are facing extradition charges to the United States.\n\nThe accused allegedly preyed on women \u2013 many of them widows or divorcees \u2013 by pretending to have a genuine romantic relationship with them.\n\nNtabazalila said the accused inflicted the losses on American citizens and others around the world.\n\n\u201cIt is a first appearance pending an extradition application. They are facing four charges in America.\n\n\u201cThose charges are conspiracy to commit wire fraud; second charges, wire fraud; third charges, is money laundering; and the fourth charge is aggravated theft of identity. It\u2019s alleged that they defrauded victims in America and other parts, in other countries.\n\n\u201cThe amount it leads to 6.8 million (US) dollars, which they defrauded from America and other countries.\n\n\u201cThere are warrants of arrests in New Jersey and Texas.

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has been urged not to give any fresh loan to the Gombe State Government in order to avoid burying the state under a mountain of debt from frivolous borrowings by the administration of Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya.\n\nIn a statement on Friday signed by Mohammed Salisu Abdullahi on behalf of the Gombe Good Leadership Association, an umbrella body of stakeholders in the state, the group called on the apex bank to resist any pressure from Governor Yahaya to grant any new loan request.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cGovernor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya has plunged Gombe State into a quagmire of crippling debts. Nothing is more reckless than borrowing money to repay a debt or cope with the crushing effect of existing debts.\n\n\u201cThe public will recall that we have recently made a press release concerning the spate of reckless borrowing by the Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya-led administration of Gombe State. Just when we thought we had seen it all from the governor, a copy of the letter by the governor to the Honourable Speaker of the Gombe State House of Assembly dated October 20, 2021 with reference number GO/GD/FED-98/V.I proved us wrong.\n\n\u201cIn the letter, the governor is requesting for the resolution of the Gombe State House of Assembly allowing him to access the Federal Government\u2019s bridging finance facility in the sum of N18,746,059,992.57bn.\n\n\u201cThe governor claimed Mr President approved N656,112,9,740.03bn bridging finance to 35 states of the federation to cushion the effect of the repayment of the existing Federal Government intervention facilities (Budget Support Facility, Excess Crude Account- Backed Loan Facility and Salary Arrears Bailout Facility).\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, we reiterate that the Muhammadu Inuwa Yaya-led administration of Gombe State has between March 2020 and July 2021 procured the following debts: \u201cN14.5bn from Guaranty Trust Bank Plc; N2bn to finance healthcare infrastructure development in Gombe State; N12bn credit facility from Guaranty Trust Bank Plc; N10.8bn from United Bank for Africa Plc, and N5bn from Family Homes Funds for the provision of one thousand units of affordable housing units.\n\n\u201cThe above-listed debts do not include the N11bn borrowed by the previous administration for the Gombe Revenue Optimisation Company Limited but received by the present government. This N11bn brings the total amount of money obtained as debt by the Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya-led administration within a space of a little over two years to N55.3bn.\n\n\u201cIf the governor is allowed to obtain the N35bn debt that has been hurriedly approved by the Gombe State House of Assembly on October 13, 2021 and the proposed debt of N18,746,059,992.57bn for which it is seeking approval in his latest letter to the Speaker of the Gombe State House of Assembly, the governor would have succeeded in amassing a total debt of over N109bn in a little over of two years of his administration.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying that the debt service to the overall revenue of Gombe State is excessive and inimical to the economic and developmental aspirations of the state.\n\n\u201cFrom the governor\u2019s showing, the revenue of the state cannot even take care of the recurrent and debt servicing portfolio of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has been indulging state governors and pressuring the Central Bank to lend monies (it doesn\u2019t have) to governors under all sorts of dubious projects and schemes.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call on the Central Bank to resist any temptation to further advance any loan to the borrowing governor of Gombe State who is hell-bent on mortgaging the state to satisfy his selfish ends.\u201d",

          "text": "In a letter dated 21st October, 2021, former National chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus move to stop PDP convention.\n\nThe letter reads:\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRE: CA/PH/341/2021: PRINCE UCHE I SECONDUS V IBEAWUCHI E. ALEX &\n\nORS.\n\nAND PENDENCY OF APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION TO RESTRAIN\n\nTHE HOLDING OF PP NATIONAL CONVENTION\n\nWe act for the Appellant in the above captioned matter, PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS, who was\n\nthe National Chairman of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP), prior to the institution of Suit\n\nNumber PHC/2183/CS/2021, and wish to bring to your attention the following facts:\n\n1. On 23 August 2021 one Mr Ibeawuchi E. Alex and four others jointly instituted Suit No\n\nPHC/2183/CS/2021 at the High Court of Rivers State, PortHarcourt Judicial Division against\n\nPrince Uche Seconds and the PP as Defendants.\n\n2. On 10 September 2021, the High Court of Rivers State delivered its judgment in the Suit\n\nwhereby Prince Uche Seconds was, inter alia, restrained from performing the functions of\n\nthe office of National Chairman of the PDP.\n\n3. An appeal has been filed and entered against the judgment at the Court of Appeal,\n\nPortHarcourt Judicial Division.\n\n4. In addition, an Application on Notice has been filed in which Prince Uche Secondus is\n\nseeking, inter alia, the following orders:\n\ni. AN ORDER of injunction restraining the PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC PARTY, the 6th Respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th\n\nand 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\n\nALTERNATIVELY TO I ABOVE\n\nii. AN ORDER that the parties to this appeal, particularly the Appellant/Applicant and\n\nthe 6th Respondent (Peoples Democratic Party) shall maintain the status quo ante as at 22 August 2021, when Appellant/Applicant was occupying the office of National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\n\n5. The application has since been served on you and other Respondents in the appeal.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the service of the Application for injunction, it has come to the Notice\n\nof our client that the PP and its officers continue to prepare to hold the National Convention on 30 and 31 October 2021.\n\n7. This letter is intended to draw your attention to the position of the law of Nigeria on this subject as encapsulated in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the celebrated case of GOVERNOR OF LAGOS STATE vs. CHIEF EMEKA ODUMEGWU OJUKWU (1986) I NWLR (Part 18) 621 @ 637, in which the court, reviewed various decisions on the point, and approved the following principles as the correct position of the law, that is:\n\n\u201cThe rule is well settled \u2026\u2026 that where a suit is brought to enjoin certain activities \u2026\u2026of which the defendant has notice, the hands of the defendant are effectually tied pending a hearing and\n\ndetermination even though no restraining order or preliminary injunction be issued\u2026..\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from all the cases is that after a defendant has been notified of the pendency of a suit seeking an injunction against him even though a temporary injunction be not\n\ngranted, he acts at his peril and subject to the power of the court to restore the status wholly irrespective of the merits as they may\n\nbe ultimately decided.\u201d\n\n8. The same position was taken by the Court of Appeal in CHIEF ELIAS OKEKE-OBA vs. IKWUKA OKOYE (1994) 8 NWLR (364) 605 @ 617-618, where the court said as follows:\n\n\u201cThe general practice is that on application for an order for interlocutory injunction, all activities affecting the res, \u2026.are automatically terminated as a mark of respect to the court before whom the application is pending.\u2026..if..parties to the suit senselessly rush their tortious trespassory activities\u2026in the spacious belief that that would promote their unfounded claims to the res. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Such heedless posture is, to say the least, a fragrant disrespect to the court. It clearly, in my opinion amounts to intransigence for a party against whom an order for injunction is sought to intensify his interference with the res.. The court cannot be hoodwinked by such impropriety of unlawful acts in relation to the res.\u2026\u2026Nor can the person in such disrespect be allowed to take advantage of his default and flagrant intransigence.\u201d\n\n9. The logical corollary of the foregoing pronouncements of the courts is that having been\n\nserved with an application seeking to restrain the holding of its National Convention\n\npending the determination of the appeal filed by Prince Uche Seconds, the PDP would\n\nbe embarking upon a collision course with the court if it proceeds to hold the National\n\nConvention before the hearing and determination of the Application.\n\n10. Should such contumacious conduct of holding the National Convention before the hearing\n\nand determination of the Application be embarked upon by the Party however, we shall\n\nnot hesitate to bring the full weight of the law against all national officers of the Party that\n\nare responsible for such conduct of contempt of court.\n\n11. Quite apart from the fact that such contumacious conduct would impinge on the integrity of the Party, we would on our part, swiftly take steps to invoke the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt to nullify any decision, action or step taken at such Convention.\n\nWe trust that you will wisely advise the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party and its officers in this regard.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nTAYO OYETIBO, SAN, FCIArb, FNIALS.",

          "title": "NNPC GMD at Editors\u2019 conference: We \u2018ve mobilised contractors for Port Harcourt refinery",
          "text": "The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) Thursday called on the federal government to adopt necessary measures in tackling the insecurity bedevilling the country.\n\nThe editors bared their minds at a two-day conference in Abuja, with the theme \u201cMedia in Times of Crises: Resolving Conflict, Achieving Consensus.\u201d\n\nAnd at the event, Group Managing Director Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Mele Kyari announced that the corporation had mobilised contractors for the fixing of Port Harcourt Refiney, while same would be done for Warri and Kaduna. Hide quoted text\n\nAlso, NGE President Mustapha Isah said while the media continue to challenge the government to up its game, the editors must also play their role in providing solutions to the festering crises.\n\nSpeaking at the event, veteran journalist and Chief Executive Officer of MayFive Media Limited, Mr Ray Ekpu, who chaired the occasion, said the federal government was deliberately playing politics with insecurity by refusing to implement recommendations by different committees set up to find a lasting solution to increasing insecurity in states across the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem that we are confronted with is the failure by our leaders to respect the tenets of democracy, the gross partisanship in the system, the huge corruption, the reckless carpet crossing, the creeping authoritarianism, the loss of trust in government due to leadership failure and the lack of respect for diversity and inclusivity.\n\n\u201cIf you condemn separation, as I do, you must also condemn what gave birth to it: injustice, unfairness, lack of equity, parochialism and prebendalism. These have deprived our country of its binding force which ought to be justice and fairness to all our countrymen and women.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have peace without justice. You cannot have development without peace. These are triplets: peace, justice and development. They work together for the good of all societies.\u201d\n\nEkpu also described as shameful and embarrassing, the exportation of crude and importation of refined products by Nigeria, even when the refineries could be fixed.\n\nTo this, the foremost journalist said \u201cwe should cover our faces in shame\u201d as a nation.\n\nNNPC boss speaks\n\nAnd in a response to the challenge posed by Ekpu, GMD NNPC Kyari said the inability to fix the nation\u2019s refineries was a consequence of the elite\u2019s greed.\n\nThe NNPC boss said: \u201cWe will not cover our faces in shame that we produce crude oil, but yet import petroleum products. We will face our problem. We will face it for what it is. What it is that we do have very significant and huge security problems in the country, particularly in the oil and gas sector. We all can agree to this.\n\n\u201cI can also say boldly that it is an elitist problem. The reason is very simple. Since the establishment of Nigerian refineries, since 1999, every attempt to carry out turnaround maintenance of NNPC refineries ended up in one form of misfortune or the other.\n\n\u201cWhy did that happen? Because processes are wrong, elites are greedy. They will not let things be done the way they should be done, culminating practically in the destruction of these refineries. We can blame NNPC personnel, we can blame contractors and others, but the key reason is that, when you dig down, you will realise and accept that we couldn\u2019t just allow the refineries to work because we can\u2019t. We are not allowed to do so.\n\n\u201cOf course, we recognise when things change. I can tell you that things have changed. In the oil and gas sector, as you may all be aware, for the first time in its history, the NNPC has succeeded to be allowed to do things the way they should be done. The one thing that we should have done is to fix these refineries.\n\n\u201cNow, I can confirm to you that we have taken responsibility and we will fix these refineries. We have started the process, contractors have been mobilised for the Port Harcourt refinery. They will also do so for both Warri and Kaduna refineries. So, before the end of this year, they will deliver.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Director-General State Security Service Yusuf Magaji Bichi, represented by the Service\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Dr Peter Afunanya, urged the editors to define story lines and set an agenda that would determine the progress and unity of Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy DG has asked me to remind you that you are critical and strategic partners in project Nigeria. He has asked me to remind you that as critical stakeholders, all hands must be on deck to mould Nigeria to the desired destination.\n\n\u201d We share the same sentiment and we believe that as editors, you define story lines. The kind of agenda, the kind of narrative that you set would determine the progress, the unity of our nation.\u201d\n\nAlso in a message, Inspector-General of Police Baba Alkali called for partnership for national security and development.\n\nRepresented by Force Public Relations Officer CP Frank Mba, the IGP said, like security agents, the media were always out there in moment of crisis chasing story.\n\n\u201cThere is more convergence of the security agencies and media than convergence. So for me, I think we must find more creative ways, more ingenious ways, more productive ways of collaborating, partnering and working together to advance a course of our national security, national consensus and national development.\u201d\n\nNPAN\n\nEarlier in his remark, President, Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria, (NPAN), Malam Kabiru Yusuf, who was represented by Publisher Blueprint Newspapers, Alhaji Mohammed Idris, said the association was working with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to ensure newsprint is affordable, adding that ombudsman will be appointed for media houses to regulate the media industry.\n\nHe said the association was also working on co-regulating of its member organisations on to tackle \u201cquackery and fake news\u201d within the newspaper industry.\n\nOn the excruciating cost of newsprint, Yusuf said NPAN was in talk with the CBN to ensure newspaper owners \u201cget foreign exchange at the official rate. Similarly, we are working towards ensuring one of our moribund newsprint mills is resuscitated.\n\nNGE president\n\nEarlier in his remarks, NGE President Isah had underscored the enormity of security challenges facing the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is no doubting the fact that insecurity is one of the major challenges facing Nigeria today. The entire country is engulfed in one form of crisis or the other. Every day, front pages of newspapers are replete with headlines \u2013 bordering on insurgency, banditry, kidnappings on the highways and schools, farmers/herders clashes, as well as the known and unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cLives are being lost; the economy is bleeding, and scarce resources , which ordinarily should have been used to address the nation\u2019s infrastructure deficit, are being deployed to tackle the security challenges. The nation can\u2019t continue like this.\n\n\u201cThe media cannot afford to be aloof at this time of a national crisis. we have to be part of the solution to insecurity, which has become an existential threat to this great nation.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this conference says it all. We should rise from this conference with a resolve to be part of the solution.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian media has a rich history of rising up in times of national challenge. We played a major role in the fight against colonial rule. We were in the forefront in the fight for the restoration of democracy. This fight led to the death of some journalists, with others imprisoned and media houses shut.\n\n\u201cSo, we are currently facing another national crisis and the media must play a significant role in finding solutions- through our consensus building and agenda setting roles.\u201d\n\nOUR ERROR\n\nIn our cover story of Friday, October 22, 2021, we erroneously quoted the NNPC GMD Mele Kyari as saying \u2018Port Harcourt refinery will be ready by the end of the year.\u2019 However, we have since realised the GMD said: \u2018We \u2018ve mobilised contractors for Port Harcourt refinery\u2019 and made necessary amends to that effect . We apologise to Malam Kyari and indeed the NNPC.\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Some persons believed to be terrorists operating in Kaduna state have opted for a new strategy in their activities by attacking the Abuja-Kaduna train, being used by many commuters to avoid the dangerous highway.\n\nA former lawmaker from the state, Senator Shehu Sani reported the double attacks Wednesday and Thursday on Facebook:\n\n\u201cYesternight (Wednesday), bandits attacked the Kaduna-Abuja train.\n\n\u201cThey planted an explosive that damaged the rail track and shattered the windshield of the train engine. They also opened fire, targeting the Driver and the Tank.\n\n\u201cIt happened between Dutse and Rijana stations. The Driver struggled to move towards Kaduna Rigasa station.\n\n\u201cThis early morning, I was on board when our train ran over another explosive damaged railings. The train nearly skidded off its track, then we miraculously escaped.\n\n\u201cAll Kaduna Abuja train operations need to be suspended for today until this issue is addressed,\u201d Sani wrote.\n\nTrain passengers stranded in Kaduna over alleged rail track bombing\n\nThe alleged bombing, it was further gathered, inflicted technical damage on the train that departed Kaduna for Abuja Thursday morning hence the unavailability of the train to take passengers back to Abuja.\n\nAccording to sources, the attempted bombing was nipped Wednesday night by security forces, a situation that made the express train that departed Abuja 6:40pm on Wednesday to arrive Kaduna around 2:00am on Thursday.\n\nThe Wednesday evening train was expected to arrive Kaduna 8:40pm, but because it took the security operatives several hours to clear the rail track of danger, the train spent over eight hours on the usual two-hour journey.\n\nThis incident is coming few weeks after an allegedly leaked memo on report of Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists fleeing from Sambisa Forest to Rijana Forest in Chikun local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nA top security source said that the security agencies in the state had since Tuesday been struggling to prevent attack on the train by terrorists suspected to be members of the ISWAP and Boko Haram groups.\n\nAccording to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, \u201cISWAP and Boko Haram members have entered Kaduna, but the security agencies have been struggling to prevent them from setting up their camp in any part of the state. Tuesday till Wednesday morning, we could not sleep because we were struggling to dislodge the terrorists who were trying to bomb a bridge used by the Kaduna-Abuja train\u201d.\n\nWhen Blueprint visited the Rigasa Train Station, it was observed that sale of tickets had been stopped, while hordes of passengers were seen in various states of dejection wondering their next line of action.\n\nPassengers who came to the train station Thursday morning to board the 10:35am train to Abuja were stranded as the 7:00am train that was supposed to arrive Kaduna by 9:00am and return passengers to Abuja by 10:35am, could not make it to Kaduna.\n\nMany of the passengers were seen returning home with their luggage, while those who felt the trip to Abuja is too urgent to be postponed or shelved decide to go by road.\n\nOne of the passengers who resides in Kaduna, Aisha Usman, explained why she chose to travel by road to Abuja. \u201cSince all these happened, and I can\u2019t postpone my journey, I had no choice than to go by road. May God protect us all from evil.\u201d\n\nWhen Kaduna state Police Command was contacted to confirm if anyone had been arrested in connection with the incident, the command\u2019s public relations officer, ASP Mohammad Jalige said, \u201cI will get back to you.\u201d\n\nAlso, when the Commissioner of Police, Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) Command, Oyediran Oyeyemi was contacted on his phone, he told Blueprint that he just alighted from airplane and there was noise. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you; I just came down from a plane.\u201d\n\nBut when a call was put through to the CP Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) Command again, he failed to pick his call.",

          "title": "FIRS proposes road taxes for motorists, others",
          "text": "The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has proposed the introduction of road infrastructure tax in Nigeria, to make the informal sector contribute to building a modern society.\n\nExecutive Chairman of FIRS, Muhammad Mamman Nami, disclosed this on Thursday while receiving a delegation of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), led by its National President, Chris Isiguzo, to his office in Abuja.\n\nNami said the proposed road infrastructure tax to be administered by FIRS would provide government with adequate funding for road construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance, as well as providing the needed security for roads in the country.\n\nAccording to the FIRS boss, \u201cOne quick and very important intervention required of you is in the area of the road infrastructure funding scheme that the country needs in order fix our roads and bringing the informal sector to the tax net.\u201d\n\nHe noted that, \u201cIn many jurisdictions, road users pay for the use of road infrastructure as such it shouldn\u2019t be seen as an additional burden on our citizens because it has the potential of making life better for all of us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Nami stated that Nigeria\u2019s economy presently relied heavily on non-oil revenues to discharge its statutory responsibility of paying salaries and providing social amenities to the citizenry.\n\n\u201cWithout the tax that you pay governments at all levels would not be able to fulfil their mandate to the electorates. Tax money also helps to ensure the roads you travel are safe and always in good condition,\u201d he said.\n\nHe disclosed that the recent rise in the price of crude oil ordinarily should have impacted positively on the Petroleum Profit Tax payable by oil producing companies. However, it has shown otherwise due to some reasons.\n\nOn the challenges facing the service for delivering on its mandate, he said: \u201cCrude oil production has been limited by OPEC quota. Nigerian OPEC quota as at July 2021 was about 1.5mbpd as against its crude oil production budget of 1.8mbpd.\n\n\u201cThis is a shortfall of 300,000 barrels per day. Our average daily crude oil production is around 1.250mbpd as against the allocated 1.5mbpd OPEC quota which has resulted in a shortfall of almost 250,000 barrels per day mainly caused by crude oil theft and force majeure declared by some of the IOCs. The total shortfall to FGN budgeted production is about 550,000 barrel per day.\n\n\u201cHuge losses brought forward and unrecouped capital allowances reported by most of the companies due to production shut in and the fall in oil price in 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic which reduced their revenue.\u201d\n\nHe said with challenges in the oil and gas sector, reforms have been carried out by the agency with visible i on the economy such as the deployment of technology in tax administration to improve domestic revenue mobilization in view of dwindling oil prices in order to avoid falling into debt crisis.\n\nNami added that the service created 10 Value Added Tax, VAT, Regional Coordination Offices across the country to drive collection of VAT.\n\n\u201cWe have commenced usage of VAT Form 002A for enrolment and tracking of branch offices of major VAT payers. This will certainly improve VAT our collection and capacity. We achieved 114.66 percent of our VAT collection target in the first half of the year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt will interest you to know that the Service collected a total of N4.2Trillion between January to September, 2021. This feat was achieved as a result of the efficiency and effectiveness of the TaxProMax Solution and intelligence/data we gathered, mined and analyzed in the period under review.\n\n\u201cThe Service successfully facilitated both the mock and external audits for the ISO 27001:2013 certification of the Exchange of Information (EOI) centre, to meet international information security management standards,\u201d the agency boss said.\n\nWhile congratulating Isiguzo on his recent re-election as the NUJ national president, he urged members of the union to not only be constructive in criticisms of the agency\u2019s operations but to always confirm and verify sources and accuracy of information available to them.\n\nEarlier, the NUJ National President, Christopher Isiguzo, said the visit was part of his resolve to engage critical institutions as a key stakeholder in charting the way forward for the country\u2019s collective good.\n\nThe NUJ president described FIRS as a vital institution in the country, which \u201crequires all the support it needs especially at a time when the country is security-challenged, adversely affected by Covid-19 and faced with FOREX crisis as well as political intrigues from different parts of the nation.\u201d\n\nHe said the NUJ has noted closely the FIRS\u2019 \u201cstrident efforts to shore up the country\u2019s revenue by deploying technology and the requisite personnel in this regard. Of interest to the Union is your digital technology solution, TaxPro-Max.\n\n\u201cThe numbers showed that it has assisted in boosting efficiency in tax administration and collection rates across the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, with your recent admission that only about 44 million out of a possible 100 million plus that pay tax makes it urgent for a robust integrated media campaign to get more Nigerians into the tax net. This the NUJ is willing to spearhead.\u201d\n\nIsiguzo assured the FIRS boss and his management team that NUJ will commend the agency where it has done noble.\n\nHe, however, noted that the union would not shy away from criticising FIRS constructively as well as holding it accountable to the Nigerian people, in line with constitutional guarantee as contained in Chapter 22 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.",

But I stood strong. The principal officers of the National Assembly stood strong. We overcame this intense pressure even from the highest level of government. We continued to broadcast the proceedings. The result of the publicity and openness was that we ultimately secured our democracy.\u201d\n\nNnamani also spoke of how he had written a speech he read to appeal to the conscience of his colleagues on the issue and how the speech \u201cworked the magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter I delivered it and called for votes to determine whether the bill should be read a second time, there was total silence. To take it beyond doubt, I called for votes a second time. There was no vote for the bill to go on to the third reading.\n\n\u201d I struck the gavel. The third term was dead \u2013 hurray! Jubilation filled the hall. Senators pumped hands and embraced one another.\u201d",

          "text": "The leader of a Haitian gang who kidnapped a group of North Americans over the weekend has threatened to execute them, according to a video seen by AFP.\n\nThe footage shot Wednesday but released Thursday on social media showed Wilson Joseph, wearing a suit and surrounded by armed men, in front of coffins containing the bodies of five members of his gang.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m not getting what I need, I\u2019ll kill these Americans,\u201d Joseph said, speaking in Haitian Creole.\n\nA senior US official speaking on condition of anonymity said the video appeared to be genuine.\n\nREAD ALSO: Israeli PM Naftali Bennette Holds First Talks With Putin\n\n\u201cAs far as I know, the video that appeared online today is legitimate,\u201d the official told reporters late Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fake video as far as we can tell right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in contact with the Christian Aid Missionaries. We are in contact constantly with Haitian National Police. The FBI is on the ground in Haiti and in contact with all the parties involved,\u201d the official added.\n\nThe kidnappers are demanding $17 million ransom for the hostages\u2019 freedom, security sources have told AFP.\n\nOn Saturday the group of 17 US and Canadian missionaries and their children were kidnapped in broad daylight while on a visit to an orphanage in the heart of an area in eastern Port-au-Prince, which is under control of the gang.\n\nThe Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, to which the abducted missionaries belong, said the group included 12 adults aged 18-48, along with five children aged eight months, three, six, 13 and 15.\n\nThe United States has advised Americans not to travel to Haiti, in particular, due to kidnappings they say regularly include American citizens.\n\nSince December 2020, Haitian police have sought Joseph for crimes including assassination, kidnapping, vehicle theft, and hijacking of cargo trucks.\n\n\u2013 Controlled by gangs \u2013\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday motor-taxi drivers blocked roads and snared traffic in the Haitian capital to protest against fuel shortages caused by gangs controlling oil access.\n\nAcross the city, demonstrators have voiced outrage over being forced to buy gasoline on the black market.\n\nGangs\u2019 tightening grip on Port-au-Prince since June has prevented secure access to two of Haiti\u2019s three oil terminals.\n\nArmed groups hijacked more than a dozen tankers at the third, located in the Cite Soleil slum, in early September.\n\nOn Thursday, near one barricade of flaming tires, protestors accused authorities of favoring fuel imports over renewable energy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an electricity grid in Haiti, so we have to look for diesel to run a generator,\u201d said one 30-something student who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons.\n\n\u201cWe have all the sun in the world but solar panels are overpriced,\u201d he said.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of growing gang influence, Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced late Thursday the appointment of a new police chief, Frantz Elbe, after the resignation of his predecessor Leon Charles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to get to work. We would like public peace to be restored, to return to normal life, and to find the path of democracy. Finally, we would like to organize elections,\u201d said Henry on Twitter.",

Danburam in their last group game on Wednesday.\n\nThere are no injury worries for both teams according to the information reaching NLO media.\n\nKick off time is 3pm on Friday and 90 minutes will tell the difference between both sides or straight to the lotteries of penalties to decide the champion of champions in 2021 NLO season.",

          "text": "The boss of a notorious Haitian gang accused of kidnapping 17 members of a U.S.-based missionary group last weekend is warning that the hostages will be killed if his demands aren\u2019t met.\n\n\u201cI swear by thunder that if I don\u2019t get what I\u2019m asking for, I will put a bullet in the heads of these Americans,\u201d gang leader Wilson Joseph said in a video posted on social media Thursday.\n\nOfficials said early in the week that the 400 Mawozo gang was demanding $1 million for each of those kidnapped, although it wasn\u2019t clear if that included the five children in the group, among them an 8-month-old. Sixteen Americans and one Canadian were abducted, along with their Haitian driver.\n\nJoseph also threatened Prime Minister Ariel Henry and Haiti\u2019s national police chief as he spoke in front of the open coffins that apparently held several members of his gang who were recently killed.\n\n\u201cYou guys make me cry. I cry water. But I\u2019m going to make you guys cry blood,\u201d he said.\n\nLater in the day, Henry\u2019s office announced that L\u00e9on Charles had resigned as head of Haiti\u2019s National Police and was replaced by Frantz Elb\u00e9. The newspaper Le Nouvelliste said Elb\u00e9 was director of the police departments of the South East and Nippes and previously served as general security coordinator at the National Palace when Jocelerme Privert was provisional president.\n\n\u201cWe would like for public peace to be restored, that we return to normal life and that we regain our way to democracy,\u201d Henry said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Charles or Elb\u00e9.\n\nThe missionaries who were abducted Saturday during a visit to an orphanage are with Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, which held a news conference before Joseph\u2019s video was posted.\n\nWeston Showalter, spokesman for the religious group, said the families of those kidnapped are from Amish, Mennonite and other conservative Anabaptist communities in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Ontario, Canada. He read a letter from the families, who weren\u2019t identified by name, in which they said, \u201cGod has given our loved ones the unique opportunity to live out our Lord\u2019s command to love your enemies.\u201d\n\nThe group invited people to join them in prayer for the kidnappers as well as those kidnapped and expressed gratitude for help from \u201cpeople that are knowledgeable and experienced in dealing with\u201d such situations.\n\n\u201cPray for these families,\u201d Showalter said. \u201cThey are in a difficult spot.\u201d\n\nThe organization later issued a statement saying it would not comment on the video.\n\nThe gang leader\u2019s death threat added to the already intense concern in and around Holmes County, Ohio, where Christian Aid Ministries is based and which has one of the nation\u2019s largest concentrations of Amish, conservative Mennonite and related groups. Many members of those groups have supported the organization through donations or by volunteering at its warehouse.\n\n\u201cMany people in the community feel helpless, but they also realize the power of prayer and the power of our historic theology,\u201d including the Anabaptist belief in nonresistance to violence, said Marcus Yoder, executive director of the Amish & Mennonite Heritage Center in Millersburg.\n\nThe same day that the missionaries were kidnapped, a gang also abducted a Haiti university professor, according to Haiti\u2019s ombudsman-like Office of Citizen Protection. It also noted a Haitian pastor abducted earlier this month had not been released despite a ransom being paid.\n\nCriminals \u201coperate with complete impunity, attacking all members of society,\u201d the office said.\n\nUNICEF said Thursday that 71 women and 30 children have been kidnapped so far this year \u2014 surpassing the 59 women and 37 children abducted in all of last year. \u201cThey represent one third of the 455 kidnappings reported this year,\u201d the agency said.\n\n\u201cNowhere is safe for children in Haiti anymore,\u201d Jean Gough, UNICEF regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement. \u201cWhether on their way to school, at home or even at church, girls and boys are at risk of being kidnapped anywhere, at any time of the day or night.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads and burned tires in Haiti\u2019s capital to protest a severe fuel shortage and a spike in insecurity and to demand that the prime minister step down.\n\nIn addition to kidnappings, the gangs are accused of blocking gas distribution terminals and hijacking supply trucks, which officials say has led to a shortage of fuel. Many gas stations remain closed for days at a time, and the lack of fuel is so dire that the CEO of Digicel Haiti announced this week that 150 of its 1,500 branches countrywide are out of diesel.\n\nAlexandre Simon, an English and French teacher, said he and others were protesting because of the dire conditions facing Haitians.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who cannot eat,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no work \u2026 There are a lot of things we don\u2019t have.\u201d",

          "text": "Twenty four hours after the anniversary marking the #ENDSARS protest, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the final report of the Judicial Panel of Enquiry and Restitution in the state was being awaited, assuring that his government would disclose the report fully to members of the public.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who spoke on the difficult task of rebuilding the state, one year after Lagos was hit by a wave of arsonist attacks resulting from protests, said the state government would not attempt to cover up the recommendations of the panel, whether it is in its favour or not.\n\nThe Governor said the panel report would be helpful in strengthening true reconciliation and preventing re-occurrence of violence in the State.\n\nLagos recorded a huge loss in assets and resources, following the violence that trailed the protest, as public transportation infrastructure, court buildings, police stations, private properties and iconic assets were razed by arsonists on October 21, 2020.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the panel was set up to look into allegations of human rights abuses against the police and also determine the cause of coordinated attacks on Lagos, noting that the panel\u2019s final report would be fully implemented.\n\nThe panel concluded its sittings last Monday, 12 months after it was constituted.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cThe panel concluded its sittings about three days ago and has asked for time to put the reports together behind closed doors. We do not know the content of the report, but we want to say publicly that, upon the handover of the report, we will be making it public.\n\n\u201cWe will not cover up anything. This is not who we are and that is not what our government stands for. We will make full disclosure of whatever recommendations that the panel will come up with. I assure citizens of Lagos that we will not leave anything to chance.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke on the arrest of some youths that participated in a drive-through #EndSARS memorial protest at the Lekki Tollgate on Wednesday, disclosing that he had ordered an unconditional release of those detained by the police, except one person who was caught with dangerous weapons at the scene.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Wednesday), we saw a protest in Lagos and everybody that was arrested in connection with the protest have all been released, except an individual that was caught with dangerous weapons and who confessed to the police that he joined the protest to cause mayhem,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe commended the police for being alive to its responsibility by identifying and isolate troublemakers from among law-abiding people who conduct themselves in line with the laws.\n\nSanwo-Olu, again, extended a hand of fellowship to the youth to be stakeholders in the development of the state, while reiterating his commitment to reconciliation. He urged them to join the rebuilding effort in order to restore the operating capacity of institutions affected in the violence.\n\nSpeaking on the rebuilding effort, the governor said the destruction had slowed down operational activities of the affected public institutions, but stressed that the State Government would not shy away from its responsibility to rebuild the facilities and restore their operating capacity.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is exactly a year ago today when Lagos was hit by violence in the aftermath of the EndSARS protests. Lagos witnessed massive destruction of infrastructure, iconic buildings, transport infrastructure, police station and others.\n\n\u201cToday being a year after the event, there is no better time to say how difficult it has been for us as a State and how committed it has been for us. As tough as it is, the Government will certainly not shy away from its responsibility. We see the incident as a challenge and we will fix it with everything that we have.\u201d\n\nSegun James and Dike Onwuamaze",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday vowed that he would never allow anything or anyone to disrupt the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State. He made the declaration during a National Security Council (NSC) meeting in Abuja with the service chiefs, where the election and rising cases of violence became the focus of attention.\n\nHe gave marching orders to the security agencies to apply overwhelming force, if necessary, to protect the November 6 governorship election and ensure it was not interrupted by non-state actors who have been heating up the polity.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), disclosed the president\u2019s directive to journalists at the end of the security meeting. Monguno said besides the fact that the people of Anambra State deserved to elect a governor of their choice, the federal government would not sit by and let non-state actors set a wrong precedent in the country\u2019s electoral experience.\n\nThe NSA stated, \u201cThe president has directed that under no circumstances will anything be allowed to stop the elections from taking place successfully. The people have a right to vote, they have a right to select their leader, and no group or individual will be allowed to stimulate anarchy and chaos, leading to murderous activities.\n\n\u201cThe president has made it very clear that the armed forces, security agencies, and law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place. If it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors. In the first place, we are in a democracy. Secondly, it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potential for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country will also want to copy this situation.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the council observed recent trends of violent activities and was desirous of seeing a hitch-free election in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe problem here is that in as much as the government wants to conduct peaceful elections, there are non-state actors who have been heating up the polity, who have made all kinds of attempts to stymie orderly elections for next month.\u201d\n\nMonguno maintained that the president did not want to contemplate a situation in which he would be boxed into a corner.\n\n\u201cThe mere thought that a group of non-state actors want to portray his government as not being able to be firm is totally out of the question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe tail cannot wag the dog, it is totally unacceptable and, again, we in the security and intelligence community have been trying as much as possible to talk with the leadership in the South-east, to make them aware of the fact that President Buhari is not averse to the aspirations of the people of the South-east,\u201d the NSA added.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cSo long as whatever they desire to achieve, they do it through the normal prescribed manner, either legislative, legal, or whatever. For as long as it is within the confines of legitimacy, President Buhari does not have a problem with that. But any action that is outlandish, any action that typifies roguery, the usurpation of the authority of the state is not going to be tolerated.\n\n\u201cAgain, we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that Nigerians, being what they are, also need to understand that if these non-state actors should go out on a limb and extend the frontiers of violence, and begin to kill people, there is a possibility that reprisal attacks can take place in other parts of the country, which is what we do not want to happen.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re working with the community leaders, with the governors and everybody to ensure that they bring their people, restrain them on the leash.\u201d\n\nHe also said the NSC reviewed the security situation across the country, noting that the various security formations \u2013 the armed forces, intelligence sector and the police \u2013 have been recording successes from one end of the country to another.\n\nAccording to him, in a short space of time, the armed forces have recorded victory over terrorist groups in the North-east, as they have eliminated, in quick succession, leaders of the notorious Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThe NSA said about two months after the Nigerian Army eliminated Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the dreaded leader of ISWAP, troops, just two days ago, killed his successor, Mallam Bako, in combat.\n\nMonguno said inter-agency cooperation among the various forces and agencies had yielded appreciable successes in communities and the economy.\n\nHe noted the unprecedented feat in security within the country\u2019s maritime environment and the recent elimination of a notorious gangster in Benue State, one Aondofa Kefas (Azonto).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOther aspects basically have to do with the current state of security in the country and the sub-region. Of course, the armed forces and security agencies have done so much in the last couple of months.\n\n\u201cLet me say clearly, in the last six months, they have been able to record a lot of successes.\n\n\u201cNow the issue here is that it is not very easy for the wider society to appreciate the successes being recorded by the armed forces, because there will definitely be incidents of misadventure. This is asymmetric conflict; it is not like the normal conventional war in which territories are won, you grapple with the enemy, you defeat him, and you move on. Here we have the enemy embedded in society, coming from all parts.\n\n\u201cLike I once said, someone had remarked after the Brighton bombing of 1984, that the difference between the terrorist or the criminal and the state is that it only takes one act for the terrorist to succeed and gain a lot of publicity, but for the armed forces, for the government and its agencies, you have to succeed on every occasion, otherwise, after 12 successes, if you fail, or you have a problem on the 13th occasion, nobody wants to know.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the situation with which we are faced. But, nevertheless, I will just highlight that the Chief of Defense Staff, service chiefs, and intelligence heads briefed Council and I can tell you that for the land forces, they have recorded a lot of successes in the last two months.\n\n\u201cWe have had a steady increase in the number of returnees, both combatants and non-combatants, from the theatre of operation; both from the Islamic State of West Africa Province and the Boko Haram enclaves.\n\n\u201cNow what has happened is we are now having to contend with 15,852 returnees. This in its own case is accompanied by problems; humanitarian problems, problems of logistics, problems of profiling each and every one because we are not just interested in profiling the ex-combatants, we are also interested in profiling those people who are assumed to be non-combatants, who may have reached out and assisted the terrorists in one way or the other.\u201d\n\nCommenting on frequent attacks and stealing of the country\u2019s arms and ammunition by bandits and terrorists, the NSA said moves were being made to end the menace.\n\nHe explained, \u201cEfforts right now are underway. As you already know, yesterday, the president had an important visitor, the president of Turkey.\n\n\u201cJust like he has had discussions with the President of Turkey, he has had discussions with other leaders on how we can share intelligence and acquire technical capabilities to deal with these emerging threats. So, it is basically a matter of looking at where we can get equipment and assets to deal with these threats.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Partial human remains found in a Florida wilderness area have been identified through dental records as belonging to Brian Laundrie, the boyfriend of murdered travel blogger Gabby Petito, the FBI said on Thursday.\n\nThe remains were discovered on Wednesday in the swampy Carlton Reserve not far from Laundrie\u2019s parents\u2019 home. Police and FBI agents had been searching for him there since his family reported him missing in mid-September.\n\nLaundrie had been named a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in Petito\u2019s disappearance but was never criminally charged in her murder. A federal grand jury in Wyoming indicted him on Sept. 23 on a single count of fraudulently using her bank debit card.\n\nPetito\u2019s disappearance in late August during a cross-country \u201cvan life\u201d road trip with Laundrie was followed closely by Americans as the case became an internet sensation and then a tabloid mystery.\n\nPetito, 22, was last been seen alive on Aug. 26. Her body was discovered on Sept. 19 near the remote Spread Creek Dispersed Campground in Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming. Medical examiners found she had been strangled.\n\nHer remains were found less than 1,000 feet (300 m) from where, on the evening of Aug. 27, another pair of travel bloggers caught video images of the couple\u2019s 2012 white Ford Transit van parked along a dirt road.\n\nPetito and Laundrie, who lived with Laundrie\u2019s parents in North Port on Florida\u2019s west coast, embarked on their trip in early July from New York\u2019s Long Island, where they had both attended high school.\n\nAs they traveled through Kansas, Colorado, Utah and points west, Petito documented their trip on social media with videos and pictures that depicted a loving couple on an American adventure.\n\nOn Aug. 12, a 911 caller reported that Laundrie was slapping and hitting Petito in front of the Moonflower Community Cooperative in Moab, Utah.\n\nMoab police stopped the van on a highway near Arches National Park. Body camera footage showed Petito crying as she described an argument that escalated into her slapping Laundrie as he drove. The officers did not detain the couple but told them to spend the night apart.\n\nPetito posted her final photo to Instagram on Aug. 25, the same day she last spoke to her mother by phone. The family believes the couple was headed to Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming at the time.",

          "title": "China Evergrande Readies Funds for Interest Payment, Set to Avert Default",
          "text": "China Evergrande Group has supplied funds to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have seen the developer plunge into formal default.\n\nThe person said Evergrande remitted $83.5 million to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday \u2013 as earlier reported on Friday by state-backed Securities Times \u2013 allowing it to pay all bondholders before the payment grace period ends on Oct. 23.\n\nNews of the remittance will likely bring relief to investors and regulators worried about a default\u2019s wider fallout in global financial markets, adding to reassurance from Chinese officials who have said creditors\u2019 interests would be protected.\n\nStill, the developer will need to make payments on a string of other bonds.\n\n\u201cThey seem to be avoiding short-term default and it\u2019s a bit of a relief that they have managed to find liquidity,\u201d said a Hong Kong-based debt restructuring lawyer representing some bondholders.\n\n\u201cBut still, Evergrande does need to restructure its debt. This payment might be a way for them to get some sort of buy-in with stakeholders before the heavy work needed on the restructuring.\u201d\n\nEvergrande did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. Citibank declined to comment. The person with knowledge of the matter was not authorised to speak with media and so declined to be identified.\n\nThe remittance comes a day after financial information provider REDD on Thursday said Evergrande had secured more time to pay a defaulted bond it guaranteed, issued by Jumbo Fortune Enterprises.\n\n\u201cThis is a positive surprise,\u201d said James Wong, portfolio manager at GaoTeng Global Asset Management, who had expected a default.\n\nThe news would boost bondholders\u2019 confidence, he said, as \u201cthere are many coupon payments due ahead. If Evergrande pays this time, I don\u2019t see why it won\u2019t pay the next time.\u201d\n\nEvergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.\n\nSubsequent non-payment would result in formal default and trigger cross-default provisions for its other dollar bonds.\n\nEvergrande\u2019s next payment deadline is Oct. 29 with the expiration of the 30-day grace period on its Sept. 29 coupon.\n\nTEMPORARY RELIEF\n\nEvergrande\u2019s dollar bond prices surged on Friday, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, data from Duration Finance showed, though they still traded at deeply distressed levels of around a quarter of their face value.\n\nIts shares rose as much as 7.8%, a day after trade resumed following a more than two-week halt pending the announcement of a stake sale in its property management unit, which was scrapped this week.\n\nEvergrande\u2019s woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.\n\nIn the latest such move, Fitch Ratings on Thursday cut Sinic Holdings (Group) Co Ltd\u2019s (2103.HK) long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to \u201crestricted default\u201d from \u201cC\u201d as the developer failed to repay its $250 million notes due Oct. 18.\n\nStill, Evergrande news helped the Hang Seng mainland properties index surge more than 4% versus a gain of 0.25% in the broader Hang Seng index (.HSI).\n\nIn mainland markets, the CSI300 Real Estate index jumped as much as 6.5%, and an index tracking the broader property sector was eyeing its biggest gain in nearly two months.\n\nFREEWHEELING\n\nEvergrande\u2019s woes had been snowballing for months. Dwindling resources set against more than $300 billion of liabilities had wiped out 80% of its value.\n\nFounded in Guangzhou in 1996, the developer epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers\u2019 debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.\n\nAnalysts said any prospect of demise would raise questions over what would happen to the more than 1,300 real estate projects Evergrande has ongoing in over 280 cities, and any impact the wider property sector.\n\nBank exposure to developers is also extensive. A leaked 2020 document, branded a fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the company\u2019s liabilities extending to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.\n\n\u201cGiven that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term,\u201d said analyst Travis Lundy at Quiddity Advisors in Hong Kong.",
