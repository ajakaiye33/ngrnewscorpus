          "title": "Telcos demand 40% increase in voice, SMS, data tariffs; NCC, expert reacts",
          "text": "By Prince Osuagwu, Hi-Tech Editor & Juliet Umeh\n\nThere are indications that telecommunications operators, telcos, in the country are planning to raise tariffs on voice calls and data by as much as 40 per cent.\n\nReliable sources from the operators who confirmed the plans to Vanguard said it was due to high cost of diesel to operate their businesses, incessant harassments and frivolous taxes and levies imposed on them by all manner of agencies from the three tiers of government.\n\nThe telcos who spoke to Vanguard on the issue said the issue is being handled by their umbrella body, the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria, ALTON.\n\nVanguard reliably gathered that ALTON has already sent a letter to the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, seeking upward review of tariffs by 40 percent.\n\nIf approved, the services that will be affected include voice calls, short message services, SMS, and data services.\n\nIt means that the telcos want the average 11k per second, N8.95 per minute current cost of voice calls jerked up to N12.53 while short message services will move from N4.00 to N5. 61.\n\nThis also means that a subscriber who spends 30 minutes on a call will have to cough out approximately N376 while those who spend one hour will have to pay at least N752.\n\nALTON\u2019s letter to NCC highlighted a few operational issues which the regulator should consider to approve the request.\n\nThey include rising cost of business operations due to high cost of diesel, and other energy sources, recent introduction of excise duty of five per cent on telecoms services, and increased burden of multiple taxes and levies on the industry. The telcos say these increments have jerked their operating expenses by over 35 per cent.\n\nTariff hike not done on sentiment \u2014 NCC\n\nHowever, a reliable source at the NCC said as much as the Commission sympathises with the conditions which have increased operating costs, tariff increment is not done with sentiment.\n\nThe source said: \u201cI am aware that the ALTON sent in a letter with a demand for increment in tariffs, but there is a process which is rigorously taken before increments are made on tariff.\n\n\u201cThe current tariff they are currently operating with went through that rigour. So, even if their demand will be considered, it will also take a process which is not going to encourage an instant implementation\u201d he added.\n\nPart of ALTON\u2019s letter sighted by Vanguard read: \u201cAs the commission may be aware, the power sector under the supervision of its Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission in November 2020 undertook a review of electricity tariffs to cater for the economic headwinds.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, ALTON considers it expedient for the telecommunications sector to undergo periodic cost adjustments through the commission\u2019s intervention to minimise the impact of the challenging economic issues faced by our members.\n\n\u201cDetails are: Upward review of the price determination for voice and data and SMS. Given the state of the economy and the circa 40 per cent increase in the cost of doing business, we wish to request an interim administrative review of the mobile (voice) termination rate for voice; administrative data floor price, and cost of SMS as reflected in extant instruments.\n\n\u201cWith respect to voice and SMS cost, ALTON respectfully requests the commission to consider a mark-up approach to address the upward price adjustment desirable for the industry. We have enclosed herein and marked Annexure 1 of our proposal in that regard.\n\n\u201cFor data services, we wish to request that the commission implements the recommendations in the August 2020 KPMG report on the determination of cost-based pricing for wholesale and retail broadband service in Nigeria. Excerpts from the report are attached and marked Annexure 2 to provide a further illustration.\n\n\u201cIn implementing the said recommendations, however, we recommend that the 40 per cent increase in the cost of doing business be factored in to arrive at a cost price per Gigabyte in view of the current economic situation.\u201d\n\nThe group also highlighted other demands to the commission such as to explore other penalties for operators other than punitive monetary sanctions, extend the payment timeline of relevant regulatory levies and fees, prevail on the Federal Government to sign the executive order declaring telecoms infrastructure as critical national infrastructure to mitigate cost spent replacing damaged and stolen infrastructures, among others.\n\nIt added that the Mobile (Voice) Termination Rate (MTR) for voice, administrative data floor price and cost of SMS as reflected in extant instruments should also be increased.\n\nThe ALTON letter added: \u201cFor large operators, a new interim MTR of N5.46 from N3.90 reflecting 40 per cent increase in the cost of business. \u201cFor small operators, the new interim MTR of N6.58 from N4.70 reflects a 40 per cent increase in the cost of business.\u201d\n\nA reliable source and senior official of ALTON who also confirmed the letter, said: \u201cAlthough we did not intend that this will be a media issue, I can confirm to you that we sent a letter to the NCC requesting upward review of tariffs.\n\n\u201cBut this shouldn\u2019t come to you as a surprise. We have always intimated that this is the only way to go, considering prevailing circumstances.\n\n\u201cRecall that while approaching the Federal Government to intervene on indiscriminate clamp down on our facilities, particularly the recent one in Kogi over frivolous taxes and levies by all manner of agencies, we did warn that we may be forced to increase tariffs.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened now is that as law-abiding citizens and responsible corporate entities, we are going about it the appropriate, responsible and legal way.\n\n\u201cFor us to serve you well, we must first of all be in business,\u201d he added.\n\nExpert reacts\n\nFor the Executive Director, Paradigm Initiatives Nigeria, Mr Gbenga Sesan, said: \u201cThe holy alliance the operators entered with ministry of communications and digital economy on the bad NIN-SIM linkage policy has come to haunt them.\n\n\u201cThe effect of that bad policy is what they are reacting to. They should have stood their ground that the policy was not right, instead of compromising their knowledge.\n\n\u201cIf they increase prices, people will adjust. Already we are used to telephone communications. What will suffer is the aggregate economy, which is why we didn\u2019t want that evil policy in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe Over the top operators will now gain ground because people will call more on whatsapp and other Voice over internet protocol platforms than normal voice calls.\n\n\u201cThat is where the revenue that was supposed to accrue for government will go to people who do not have physical presence in our economy.\u201d",

Ending the polluting and wasteful practice of gas flaring and decarbonising oil and gas production, while also accelerating the transition to cleaner energy, is fundamental to mitigating climate change.\u201d\n\nA statement announcing the release of the report said: \u201cGas flaring results from market and economic constraints and a lack of appropriate regulation and political will. The practice releases pollutants into the atmosphere, and we estimate that the practice released 361 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, 39 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in the form of methane, and black carbon (soot), contributing significantly to global warming.\n\n\u201cWhile 2021 showed disappointing progress amidst the global pandemic, some promising flaring reduction trends emerged in several countries. GGFR finds that the United States is the only one of the top 10 flaring countries to have successfully reduced flare volumes while increasing production over the last decade, decreasing its flaring intensity \u2014 the volume of gas flared per barrel of oil produced \u2014 by 46 percent. In a companion report, Global Flaring and Venting Regulations, GGFR examines the flaring and venting policies of 21 countries, and highlights successful approaches to reducing emissions. The report finds that many countries have also demonstrated leadership in flare reduction.\u201d\n\nThe GGFR\u2019s Programme Manager at the World Bank, Zubin Bamji, said policies to reduce gas flaring and venting have not proven effective.\n\n\u201cOur new regulatory review and analysis will help governments create the right policies for their specific circumstances so routine flaring and venting can come to an end by 2030, which is our collective goal,\u201d Bamji said.\n\nThe GGFR is a partnership of governments, oil companies, and multilateral organisations to end routine gas flaring at oil production sites around the world. It helps identify solutions to the array of technical, economic and regulatory barriers to flaring reduction. It seeks to end routine gas flaring and venting by 2030.",

It stipulates that parties must conduct primaries and submit their list of candidates at least 180 days before the general elections. Key political parties have fixed dates for the conduct of presidential primaries.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nDaily Sun, however, learnt that powerful interests within the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been mounting pressure on INEC for an extension to buy time to complete ongoing negotiations for the late entrance of their presidential aspirant.\n\nIt was also learnt that the interest had reached out to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other parties to get their buy-in.Both INEC and PDP , the source claimed , have rejected the move.\n\nThe source said\u201cThe move is being resisted by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other political parties that are members of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC). They\u2019re insisting that the primaries must be held as already scheduled by INEC in its elections guidelines,\u201d a source privy to the deal said.\n\nAlready, INEC has given the first week of June as deadline for political parties to conduct and submit names of candidates.\n\nIt is unclear if the electoral umpire would cave in and adjust its earlier elections timetable to accommodate concerns raised by the APC leaders.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

INEC is not succumbing . But the pressure keeps mounting. Unfortunately, INEC cant get the buy-in of major opposition political parties like the PDP and members of IPAC. Without their support, INEC can\u2019t do anything.\n\n\u201cIt appears APC has lost that fight. The new division in the party is over the entry of a ranking member of the National Assembly into the race. He was suddenly drafted by financiers of a southern candidate who withdrew from the race citing the unwillingness of some powerful forces in the APC and the presidency to give him clear assurance.\n\n\u201cAPC has a lot to do before the deadline. It has not set up a committee on zoning and time is not on its side. The coming weeks will be interesting and the party may face tough challenge if it doesn\u2019t manage the growing list of aspirants who want to succeed Buhari.\u201d\n\n\u2022APC extends sale of nomination forms\n\nAs if to lend credibility to the extension plt, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC, yesterday, announced extension sales of expression of interest and nomination forms to Tuesday, May 10.\n\nThe party in a statement by the its National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, also fixed a new date for congresses to elect local, state and national delegates.\n\n\u201cIn a revised timetable issued by the APC National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Muhammad Argungu, the last day for submission of completed forms and accompanying documents is now set for Wednesday, May 11 while congresses to elect Local Government Area (LGA), state and national delegates would now be Thursday, May 12 May to Saturday, May 14.",

          "text": "\u2022Funds may put party in vantage position against opposition\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\n\n\nA conservative estimate by THISDAY has shown that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may rake in over N30 billion from the sale of nomination and expression of interest forms, giving the ruling party enormous firepower to face the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWith a huge war chest expected from sale of forms, the ruling party will have a commanding advantage in the field if the resources are properly deployed,\u201d a political analyst, who preferred anonymity, told THISDAY last night.\n\nThe presidential nomination form in APC goes for N100 million; the governorship form is sold for N50 million; Senate, N20 million; House of Representatives, N10 million; and House of Assembly, N2 million.\n\nA rundown on the expected revenue from the electoral process shows APC may generate over N2.3 billion from the sale of presidential forms; N2.8 billion from the sale of governorship forms; and roughly N6.54 billion from the sale of senatorial forms. The party could make about N10.8 billion from the sale of forms to a minimum of three House of Representatives aspirants from each of the country\u2019s 360 federal constituencies. And it could generate about N7.93 billion from the sale of forms to a minimum of four aspirants vying for each of the 991 House of Assembly seats across the country.\n\nTHISDAY arrived at these estimates looking at the number of likely contestants in the various categories of elective offices.\n\nSo far, 23 presidential aspirants have indicated interest in the presidency under the ruling party and APC is expected to generate N2.3 billion from the sale of presidential forms. As more contenders join the race or drop out of the race, the figures would either go up or come down.\n\nWith governorship elections holding in 28 states next year, THISDAY estimated that there would be at least two aspirants from each of the states, and at N50 million per aspirant, the party stood to rake in N2.8 billion.\n\nFor the Senate, there are 109 senatorial seats in the country, and with at least three aspirants from each senatorial district, and forms going for N20 million, the party may rake in N6.54 billion. The 360 House of Representatives seats, with an estimated three aspirants per federal constituency, and the form going for N10 million, give the party about N10.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, with an estimated four people picking nomination forms to contest in the primary election for each of the 991 House of Assembly seats, at N2 million per form, APC is likely to rake in N7.93 billion.\n\nThose that have either indicated interest in contesting the APC presidential primaries or picked their forms include the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Governor Muhammed Abubakar of Jigawa State, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, and former Senate President Ken Nnamani.\n\nOthers are former National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiohmole; former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige; Minister of Science and Technology, Dr, Ogbonnaya Onu; Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio; Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; Gbenga Olawepo; Ihechukwu Dallas; Chima Usman; Tein Jack Rich; and Pastor Tunde Bakare.\n\nPolitical analysts believe with the ruling party raking in over N30 billion, it would be going into the election from a position of strength against the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which is working hard to take power from APC.\n\nNational Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, recently justified the high cost of the party\u2019s nominations forms, saying the party has no regrets whatsoever fixing the presidential form for N100 million. Adamu explained that APC came up with the idea to discourage spoilers and unserious contenders from the race.\n\nHe said the party did its homework before arriving at the amount, adding that the cost has to be high because of the need to raise sufficient funds to conduct primaries and successfully prosecute the coming elections.\n\nAdamu said the party was aware that some of the aspirants were not serious contenders but mere jesters out to cause problems.\n\nA source told THISDAY that about 50 per cent of the presidential aspirants might have paid the mandatory fees and collected the forms, while others were believed to be looking for money to beat the deadlines.\n\nThe party had in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, extended the time for the sale of expression of interest and nomination forms for the 2023 general election to May 10 due to what an insider attributed to the \u201clong holiday.\u201d\n\nIn a revised timetable released by the party\u2019s National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Argungu, APC said the last day for the submission of completed forms and accompanying documents would now be May 11.\n\nThe Jigawa State governor was said to have told APC stakeholders in Dutse on Tuesday, \u201cI will join the presidential race since everyone knows I\u2019m a highly qualified person to do the job.\u201d He reportedly said he was pressurised to contest for the presidential office by his colleagues.\n\nThere are also indications that the Kebbi State governor, Atiku Bagudu, may declare his interest in the presidency and pick his form soon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Wants attackers of Global Body\u2019s Building in 2011 Prosecuted\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\n\n\nUnited Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the intergovernmental organisation remains steadfast in its commitment to a peaceful Nigeria. Guterres stated this yesterday in Abuja during a two-day visit to the country.\n\nGuterres called for the prosecution of those that attacked the UN House in Abuja on August 26, 2011, stressing that perpetrators of terrorism in Nigeria must be held to account. He said the international body dedicated to maintaining global peace and security was adopting a victim-centred approach to the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nGuterres, who also paid a working visit to President Muhammadu Buhari, disclosed that the UN had concluded plans to offer Nigeria an additional $351 million as part of its $1.1 billion humanitarian response scheme for the country.\n\nBuhari, in his remarks, expressed Nigeria\u2019s gratitude to the UN and world leaders who were supporting the country in its fight against terrorism. He said the recent spotlight on Russia and Ukraine could easily distract attention from other pertinent global challenges.\n\nThe UN chief, who was on the last day of his two-day visit, laid a wreath in honour of victims of the August 26, 2011 terrorist attack on the UN House. The attack claimed the lives of 23 persons, including many UN staff and civilians.\n\n\u201cOn that tragic day (August 26, 2011), an appalling terrorist attack on the UN House left 23 UN employees and civilians\u2019 dead and 16 injured,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cThose staff members, who lost their lives, are heroes, who proudly served Nigerians through the UN organisations,\u201d he added.\n\nThe secretary-general stated, \u201cWe encourage all Nigerians, who have endured similar violence in their own communities. In our victim-centred approach, perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nGuterres thanked the Nigerian government for repairing the UN House, which had enabled the staff to return.\n\nSpeaking after meeting with the UN chief, Catholic Archbishop Emeritus of Abuja, Cardinal John Onaiyekan, told reporters that his interaction with Guterres was on how to resolve the dilemma of a country full of talented people, but facing a lot of challenges.\n\nOnaiyekan said, \u201cNigerians are genuinely religious, but we see around us so much corruption and outright wickedness.\u201d He stated that it had become pertinent to interrogate how a nation could be so rich, but full of poor people; and how a nation could be full of talented people and yet hardly organised.\n\nThe priest laid the problem at the door of the government.\n\nOnaiyekan said he told the UN secretary-general that Nigerians \u201care not satisfied with how far the rulers are dealing with the issues concerning us, the issue of poverty, the issue of insecurity, and the issues of social services. The government tells us they are doing their best and we say that their best is not good enough. We believe we can do better.\u201d\n\nOn the lingering herders-farmers\u2019 crisis, the Cardinal regretted the failure of the federal government to address the issue of armed herdsmen in the last 10 years, saying this is perpetuating the displacement of farmers.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt seems the displacement is becoming permanent and the herders are taking over the farmlands and the government still claims they have no way of bringing things back to normalcy. The result is that farmers can no longer farm and we are facing the prospects of famine, because the parts of Nigeria that used to produce a lot of food, many of them can no longer farm.\u201d\n\nA Professor of Law at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, who also met the UN chief with her group, said, \u201cWe discussed the problems and the status of women in Nigeria and how he can help us to hold our elected officials to account, especially, when it comes to gender parity and women participation in politics.\u201d\n\nDuring his meeting with Buhari, Guterres said following his visit to Borno State on Tuesday, \u201cI came out of Borno with the sense that Nigeria is able to defeat this threat.\n\n\u201cWe are very active in support of the humanitarian efforts of the Nigerian government and that is why we have called for an additional $351 million as part of the overall $1.1 billion for humanitarian response plan for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut despite all they have seen and endured, the people I met remain hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives.\n\n\u201cTo that end, I welcome the establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Return and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North-east.\n\n\u201cThis spirit of hope amidst hardship \u2013 and solidarity in struggle \u2013 was also at the centre of my discussions with the presidency today.\u201d\n\nThe secretary-general said discussions with Buhari also touched on laying the groundwork for peaceful and democratic elections in the country next year, and the full participation of Nigerian women and young people.\n\nWhile speaking with newsmen, Guterres stated that measures to address security challenges in the country, Lake Chad, and the Sahel, including the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel, were discussed during his meeting with Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe also discussed the government\u2019s measures to address security challenges across the country. I want to extend my deepest condolences to the victims of the appalling attacks in Plateau State two and a half weeks ago. It\u2019s a tragic reminder of terrorism scourge across West Africa and the Sahel.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why the United Nations is committed to supporting national and regional efforts to combat terrorism, violent extremism, organised crimes and the root causes, such as poverty, exclusion and food insecurity. This includes the UN\u2019s integrated strategy for the Sahel.\u201d\n\nGuterres thanked Buhari for supporting the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission, and promised more commitment from the UN on COVID-19 vaccination, vulnerability of countries to global warming, global food crisis response, and reform of the UN Security Council.\n\n\u201cI thanked President Buhari for his unwavering support of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission. And we also discussed the other challenges that, of course, Nigeria is facing today. Nigeria was, like all African countries, victim of the unequal recovery from COVID-19,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UN secretary-general said the war in Ukraine would make things worse with regard to global food, energy and financial systems.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur analysis indicates that the war in Ukraine is only making things worse, setting in motion a three-dimensional crisis that is devastating global food, energy and financial systems for the developing countries.\n\n\u201cThat is why in the earliest days of this war, I established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, involving all UN agencies and international financial institutions.\n\n\u201cThe steering committee is chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General that you know very well, Amina Mohammed, and the group has developed concrete recommendations in three areas.\n\n\u201cOne, we need to ensure a steady flow of food and energy through open markets by lifting all unnecessary export restrictions, directing surpluses and reserves to those in need, and keeping a lid on food prices to calm our market volatility.\n\n\u201cBut let me be clear, there is really no true solution to the problem of global food security without bringing back the agricultural production of Ukraine and the food and fertiliser production of Russia and Belarus into world markets, despite the war. I\u2019m determined to do everything to facilitate a dialogue that can help achieve this objective.\n\n\u201cTwo, on energy, countries must resist hoarding, and release strategic stockpiles and additional reserves to countries in need, while accelerating the deployment of renewable energy.\n\n\u201cAnd, three, international financial institutions need to urgently increase liquidity and fiscal space and improve existing debt relief mechanisms, so governments can now not only avoid default, but they can invest in their people, especially in universal social protection at this moment of rising prices.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations presented concrete proposals during the spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, ranging from the mobilisation of the various funds and instruments that already exist \u2013 but are not sufficiently implemented \u2013 to a much stronger use and redistribution of special drawing rights, as well as effective debt relief measures.\u201d\n\nGuterres, who was in Borno State on Tuesday, said what he saw was a departure from the picture of hopelessness and despair that had been painted, adding, \u201cPeople exuded hope.\u201d\n\nHe stated, \u201cYesterday (Tuesday), I visited Maiduguri, where the United Nations is supporting the internally displaced. I was deeply moved by their stories and struggles.\n\n\u201cThese include the struggles with hunger, with the World Food Programme projecting 4.1 million people in the North-east of Nigeria to be food insecure in the upcoming lean season.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I had the opportunity to visit Borno State and I must confess I arrived in Borno with the impression caused by so many years in which I was hearing stories about how dramatic the situation was, so terrible. The suffering of the people, how impossible to control the terrorist activities, a sense of despair.\n\n\u201cBut the Borno I met yesterday was the Borno of hope and I saw an enlightened policy, aiming not only at defeating militarily the terrorists, but at addressing the root causes of terrorism.\n\n\u201cI saw the governor committed to re-establish the confidence between the people in the government, committed to provide the people in their different villages around the state the capacity to protect themselves.\n\n\u201cCommitted to create conditions for the return of the displaced, but also for the reintegration of those that have abandoned Boko Haram, that have finally discovered that terrorism is a crime against humanity and the crime against God\u2019s will and that now need support to reintegrate into society, and that support I could witness in the visit I made.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why yesterday I appealed strongly to the international community to fully support what is being done in Borno State, to make sure that the hope that I saw can be transformed into a reality of peace and prosperity for everybody.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe Nigeria and its people have a big role to play in shaping solutions to the global crisis engulfing our world.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Buhari noted that the country and the African continent were already concerned that the attention on Russia and Ukraine could crowd out other global issues. He added that the visit of the UN chief clearly showed that \u201cthe world has not forgotten us.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buhari, terrorism remains a threat to global peace, security and progress, with many killed, and millions displaced by the insurgents.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhen we assumed office, the North-east was the major security problem we inherited in 2015, but we have been able to make people understand that you cannot kill people and shout \u2018Allahu Akbar,\u2019 (God is great!).\n\n\u201cIt is either you don\u2019t know what you are saying or you are simply stupid. God is a God of justice, so you cannot kill people and say God is great. Luckily, the people understood our message and it has made great impact.\u201d\n\nBuhari told his visitor that the government had started a gradual, but steady, process of resettlement and reintegration, where citizens were encouraged to return to their farms, businesses and other pursuits in life.\n\nThe president thanked the secretary general for the maiden visit to Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nComing Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m., Techpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday for the third month in a row at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.\n\nTechpoint Pitch Friday is a platform for early-stage founders and aspiring entrepreneurs to share their business ideas or businesses. In exchange, they receive feedback while being interrogated by the audience.\n\nTo attend this month\u2019s edition, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nElon Musk\u2019s plan to charge governments and businesses to use Twitter\n\nNorebase\u2019s $1 million seed\n\nGoogle shutting down YouTube Go\n\nMasa Finance\u2019s $3.5 million pre-seed\n\nGovernments and businesses might soon pay to use Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you think I was joking when I said, \u201cTwitter may never be the same again\u201d? Well, today\u2019s update provides more clarity to my previous post.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 3, 2022, Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, announced that Twitter might charge a \u201cslight\u201d fee for commercial and government users. This is part of Musk\u2019s effort to boost revenue, which has lagged behind larger competitors like Meta platforms.\n\nBut isn\u2019t this at odds with his primary interest in Twitter, which has to do with the company\u2019s censorship of free speech?\n\nEven though Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition has not yet been completed, recall that he agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion in a deal funded by $21 billion of his own money, $12.5 billion borrowed against his Tesla shareholding, and the remainder covered by bank loans.\n\nIt appears the estimated termination fee of $1 billion associated with the funding has fueled speculation that Musk will impose fees on the platform and cut costs to make the transaction financially viable.\n\nPer Reuters, Musk told banks that to cut costs, he would develop new ways to monetise tweets and tighten executive pay. Also, he planned to develop features to increase business revenue, including new ways to monetise tweets that contain important information or go viral.\n\nCurrently, Twitter has 229 million daily users around the world. Interestingly, at the annual Met Gala in New York on Monday, May 2, 2022, Musk said he wants to broaden Twitter\u2019s reach beyond its current \u201cniche\u201d and would like a much larger percentage of the American population to be on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you think this means for you and me outside the United States? Maybe it\u2019s nothing. Perhaps I\u2019m the one reading meaning into it.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear how much Musk intends to charge businesses and governments or whether certain groups, like non-profits and journalists, will be exempt from imposed fees.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nNorebase\u2019s $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorebase, an African trade technology company, has raised $1 million in seed funding.\n\nSamurai Incubate and Consonance Investment led the round. Also, Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad), Kinfolk VC, Future Africa, Ventures Platform, Microtraction, Boleh Capital, Voltron Capital, Wuri Ventures, and Afropreneur participated.\n\nLaunched by Adetola Onayemi and Tope Obanla in September 2021, Norebase enables founders and businesses to launch and scale across multiple African countries at the same time or regularly.\n\nWhat does this mean? \u201cWhat Norebsase is doing for you is simple \u2014 we are providing you with the digital infrastructure for you to register, start, and scale your business in any African country. The idea is to build a digital infrastructure that ensures that anybody can actually just get into either their own market or another market without too much of a hassle,\u201d Onayemi once told Techpoint Africa.\n\nTo have a better understanding of how Norebase works, read the chat Ogheneruemu had with Onayemi here: What borderless expansion looks like for African startups with Norebase\n\nMoreover, Norebase claims to have delivered 100% month-on-month growth in transaction volumes over the last six months in terms of traction. During the same period, revenue increased by 40% month after month.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve Norebase\u2019s plug-and-play API, expand its trademark registration technology stack, and hire more people.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Norebase also launched its Incorporation API \u2014 a plug-and-play service \u2014 that allows other businesses, like payment processors and banks, to provide incorporation services to their customers.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, Ogheneruemu explained how the API works. You can listen to it here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report has been released and below are some of the highlights of the report:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can download the report here.\n\nGoogle to shut down YouTube Go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 3, 2022, Google announced that YouTube Go would be shut down permanently in August 2022. It was introduced in 2016 to serve users in areas with limited connectivity, data prices, and low-end devices.\n\nAccording to Google, since its launch, \u201cYouTube has invested in improvements to the main YouTube app that make it perform better in these environments, while also delivering a better user experience that is inclusive of our entire community.\u201d\n\nI can sense some D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: Earlier this year, Google gave a similar reason when it announced the discontinuation of Chrome\u2019s data-saving Lite mode.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that Google revealed in 2020 that YouTube Go had over 500 million downloads, making it one of the platform\u2019s most popular apps. Also, in December 2021, Google redesigned the UI for Android 12 Go, among other things.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for YouTube Go users? Google advises YouTube Go users to download the main YouTube app or visit youtube.com in their browsers.\n\nWhat do YouTube Go users who want to switch to the YouTube app benefit? Compared to YouTube Go, the main YouTube app offers a better overall user experience and includes features that the former does not.\n\nYouTube Go users, for example, are unable to comment, post, use dark mode, or create content within the app. They can now use the main YouTube app to access all of YouTube Go\u2019s missing features.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Google stated that it is developing new user controls to help viewers with limited data usage reduce their mobile data usage.\n\nUntitled Design Conference (UDC 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDC 2022 is a full-day hybrid conference being curated for designers of all levels and specialisations, with a projection of over 500 designers to be in attendance. Our goal is to bring together bright minds to give talks that are idea-focused, and on a wide range of subjects, to foster learning and provoke conversations that matter.\n\nWe have amazing speakers such as Fungi Dube (Zimbawe), Ola Helland (Norway), Emmanuel Adigwe (Norway), Victor Fa (Nigeria), Leslie Williams (Nigeria) and much more. Get your tickets here.\n\nThe event is scheduled for May 7th 2022, from 8am \u2013 5pm WAT. Venue \u2013 Zone tech park, Gbagada, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nMasa Finance\u2019s $3.5 million pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasa Finance, a US-based hybrid credit protocol and decentralised credit bureau, has raised $3.5 million in pre-seed funding.\n\nThe round \u2014 which has no lead investor \u2014 is funded by traditional and web3-focused venture capital firms like Unshackled Ventures and Lateral Capital. Also, executives from GoldenTree Asset Management, Flori Ventures, and GSR \u2014 a global crypto market \u2014 participated. Other investors include Decentranet Intersect VC, Peer VC, Alves Ventures, and some angel investors in the fintech/blockchain space.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Brendan Playford (CEO), the company is built on three pillars: unlocking financial data, new sources of capital, and allowing individuals to own and share their credit history with any lender.\n\nMasa\u2019s web3 infrastructure integrates over 10,000 off-chain data sources from credit bureaus, bank data aggregators, and alternative data sources from 78 countries, allowing the startup to create on-chain credit scoring for its users.\n\nAlso, Playford says Masa is built on Celo and Ethereum, and the platform \u2014 which is currently in beta \u2014 has 36,000 people signed up. Most of its current users are from sub-Saharan Africa, specifically Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nBesides, the company claims that its on-chain data covers 26 integrations ranging from exchanges to wallets, opening up a 4.95 billion-person market in which 67 percent are credit invisible. Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Gemini, and Metamask are available.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Masa Finance intends to use blockchain technology to \u201cdisrupt traditional centralised credit infrastructure by providing individuals, businesses, and developers with the tools to access credit.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

With most African countries primarily running on 4G networks, some telcos began testing 5G networks.\n\nIn South Africa, MTN is doing the same and, on Tuesday, May 3, 2022, announced a $39.1 million investment in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. This news started our discussion on the Techpoint Africa Podcast.\n\nFor our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, although 5G can only work with 5G-powered devices, bringing 5G connectivity to rural areas could help organisations in these places. It could also encourage migration from remote workers, a phenomenon that Emmanuel is counting on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nY Combinator\u2019s impact on African startups was the next topic on the agenda. If you were not aware, Y Combinator is the Ivy League of accelerators and has backed some of the most successful companies globally, including Stripe and Airbnb.\n\nSome of the most valuable startups in Africa, including Wave, Paystack, and Flutterwave, are Y Combinator alumni.\n\nOur Intelligence arm just concluded a report in partnership with Y Combinator, which you can download here. The discussion on Y Combinator\u2019s impact led us to share our thoughts on funding as a metric for judging successful startups.\n\nOluwanifemi and Ogheneruemu said startups should be judged by factors other than how much they have raised, a position I agree with. After all, recent events (read Fast and Theranos) have proven that a startup\u2019s ability to raise money does not indicate how well the business is doing.\n\nLast but not least was Norebase\u2019s $1 million seed round and its launch of what I call Incorporation as a Service (IaaS).\n\nWith this new offering, B2B startups can now help businesses on their platform get incorporated or register a business name. We also discussed the possible use cases and the possible effects on both businesses and governments.\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Podcast is available on all Podcast platforms, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

We also welcome feedback at podcast@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

The facility is fully furnished, and equipped with modern ICT infrastructure, which include SMART Interactive Boards, 100 computers with licensed software, a customised e-Learning Portal for access to online courses and training among other state-of-the art fixtures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Centre will promote teaching and learning of ICT education and will provide a conducive learning environment to scholars and researchers alike. With its frontline technological facilities, the Centre will give students, lecturers, and researchers the resources and connectivity to keep them in step with global ICT practice and advancement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its ICT functionality, the Centre has been deliberately designed by the Project Sponsors (NNPC & SNEPCo) and the Contractor (The Offshore Lab) to promote good citizenship, value orientation and energy sustainability through the integration of features such as:\n\nDedicated cycling infrastructure with bicycles donated to the Centre; An outdoor collaboration garden with canopy trees, branded seats, wi-fi access and recycling bins; Trees and gardens including 28 king palm trees, 10 canopy trees, flower beds and grass around the building\u2019s perimeter Bold signage and access strategy including \u2013 disabled parking area and ramp access, pedestrian routes, speed limit signs, safety and directional signs etc.\n\nThe ICT Centre is also equipped with a 3D Printer, and associated academic materials, to introduce the University\u2019s students to advancements in the additive manufacturing space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Emeka Obiwulu, CEO of The Offshore Lab (Project Contractor):\n\n\u201cOur saturated labour market struggles to cope with the 600,000-plus graduates produced yearly by Nigeria\u2019s tertiary institutions. This is a large army of energetic youth that could either end up as national assets or national liabilities, depending on how well the energy and potential of this group is harnessed.\n\nTransformational projects as the FUPRE ICT Lab have therefore become very necessary to address some of these national issues, through the provision of infrastructure, equipment and learning required to incubate tomorrow\u2019s tech entrepreneurs, engineers, freelancers, and employers of labour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also the fact to consider, of the rapidly growing tech space (and correspondingly growing investment potential) in Nigeria, which requires deliberate strategies to adequately upskill the resource pool necessary to support and sustain the growth of this sector. The ICT Centre is a perfect material example of such a strategy.\n\nMy team and I are grateful to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and to Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), for the opportunity to serve and deliver a project of such strategic importance\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

Looking forward, Mushe hopes to work with video game providers to help metaverse gamers monetize their skills too.\n\nFacilitating transactions\n\nThe DeFi pioneer aims to become the only financial app users need. Mushe wants to help users swap back and forth between cryptocurrencies and fiat with ease, send money transfers and pay for goods and services.\n\nDeveloped by financial experts with years of experience, Mushe plans to cover all bases by offering prepaid cards connected to current accounts and allowing users to spend with merchant partners and send money in fiat or crypto to contacts, without fuss.\n\nKeeping it current\n\nThese current accounts will minimize the time needed to transfer between cryptos and fiat, and give users peace of mind knowing that their accounts are secure, easily accessible, and even able to receive their monthly salaries.\n\nBoth the user ID and the token\u2019s validity will need to be verified before transactions can be made, which will offer an added level of security.\n\nRewarding loyal users\n\nMushe aims to reward peer-to-peer interaction and trading, rewarding users for using its services and for their loyalty, as well as incentivizing ethical initiatives and behavior.\n\nNot only that, but Mushe will also allow business users to utilize Mushe token reward schemes to complement their marketing campaigns, incentivizing consumers to get involved.\n\nAiming to be a positive force for good, Mushe will let the community decide which charitable organizations will receive the one percent of Mushe tokens set aside to contribute to a healthier world.\n\nProviding financial education\n\nIn an exciting world developing at breakneck speed, financial education is necessary to ensure accessibility to the crypto world for all.\n\nMushe will offer tools and share knowledge to help users get up to speed on everything they need to know. It plans to provide market information, explain the jargon, and break down the trickier elements, educating users about the benefits and risks of new opportunities and helping them grow their investments.\n\nA whole new ecosystem\n\nThe MusheVerse is a simple ecosystem that does away with the complexities common in the crypto world. XMU is interoperable across fiat and crypto, the Mushe Wallet is seamlessly integrated, and users can trade and transfer with Mushe Swap.\n\nThe MusheVerse facilitates e-commerce, while Mushe Chat will allow users to connect socially.

We should be united and not be our own opponents. The way we go about this primary election is very important.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time since 1999 that a fundamental amendment has been made to the Electoral Act. After the primary election, we have nine months to prepare and campaign and the journey will not be easy or cheap. We should conserve our energy for this process. We should work in unity to win the forthcoming EDHA election in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have a primary election coming up and I am not asking anybody to step down but to sit with party leaders and see how to discuss and dialogue to reduce the number of aspirants to enable us to work better. If everyone decides to go into the primary, so be it as we all belong to one big family.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cPDP will select candidates to go and contest for the position against candidates from other parties. For contestation at this level, we can\u2019t be our own opponents. In any particular constituency, only one or two people will win, depending on the number of seats. We all will rally round to support those that emerge and together we will win the election.\u201d\n\nWarning against politics of bitterness, the governor stated, \u201cI want to warn all the aspirants, I don\u2019t want any of you to spend your future or sell your properties because of the election. There is a lot of bitterness in politics; we need to stop this as it can\u2019t lead us to the political evolution that we desire. Edo is a pacesetter.\n\n\u201cI want to stay neutral in the build up to this primary despite the several calls I have received. Every aspirant is my own; the PDP is one and my goal is that the PDP must win at the state level, National Assembly and Presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the first step towards winning. I want us to be strong and not go into the contest weak,\u201d Obaseki urged.\n\nOn his part, Edo PDP Chairman, Tony Aziegbemi disclosed that 164 aspirants bought the EDHA forms, while 162 persons returned their forms and were screened and cleared to contest the primary election.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Omoregie Ehigie Armstrong, stated that, they were in Government House, to inform the Deputy Governor of their up coming Founders Day celebration.\n\nHe added that the event would provide a platform to honour some deserving personalities, including Governor Godwin Obaseki, his wife, Mrs.Betsy Obaseki,as well as the wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Maryann Philip Shaibu, among others.\n\nHighlight of the courtesy visit was the official presentation of jerseys to the Deputy Governor and his wife for the NSE\u2019s novelty match,as part of activities to mark the Founders Day celebration.\n\nThe courtesy visit had in attendance the Permanent Secretary, Office of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Bose Joy Igbinobaro as well as her counterpart in Edo State Sports Commission, Mrs. Sabina Amiemenoghena Chikere.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Igbo Elders Consultative Forum (IECF) has alleged that there is a conspiracy within the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to thwart power rotation to the south despite the provision of zoning in their constitutions.\n\nThe forum, which asked the leadership of the parties to resist the move, warned Southeast politicians to desist from working against the zone\u2019s presidential bid or accepting to be running mates to any presidential candidate from another geopolitical zone.\n\nIt added that they would hesitate to sanction and place a curse on such politicians.\n\nThe forum led by former Anambra State governor, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezelfe, at a press conference in Abuja, called on the APC and PDP to zone their presidential tickets to the South East, adding that it would be unfair to deny the region the slot in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe hear of a conspiracy to negate the constitutional provisions of the party, especially the PDP as zoning and rotation in the constitution. We have been zoning and rotating. Now that it is the turn of the South East all kinds of things are being said,\u201d Ezeife said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave this country by choice. But one thing we reject totally is being slaves. We refuse being slaves. Those who are educated know that Igbo slaves drowned themselves in a river just so they won\u2019t continue to be slaves. If the 2023 presidency eludes us, we will take it that the rest of Nigeria has denied us citizenship rights in Nigeria. That leaves us no choice but to look for ways to survive outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of the forum, Prof Charles Nwekeaku, said they support the demand of the Southern Governors Forum, the Southern and Middle Belt Forum, the Afenifere, the Niger Delta Forum, Ohanaeze WorldWide among other credible stakeholders and organizations that all political parties in the country should zone the 2023 presidency to the South, and possibly micro-zone it to the South East for the sake of justice, equity and fairness.\n\n\u201cWe commend Chief Edwin K Clark, leader of the Southern/Middle Belt Forum and PANDEF, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Leader of Afeefere. Dr Butrus Porgu, leader of the Middle Belt Forum, and other prominent and patriotic Nigerians, who have spoken the truth and publicly demanded that all political parties in the country should zone the 2023 presidency to the South East not just for the sake of justice, equity and fairness, but also to permanently heal the wound of the civil war that has grossly marginalized the lebos in the country\u2019s scheme of affairs;\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that apart from Section 14 (3) of the 1999 Constitution, which provides for the principles of Federal Character and quota system in whatever the government and its agencies do in order to give every part of the country a sense of belonging, the constitutions of major political parties in the country, including the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, and All Progressives Congress, APC, provide for zoning system.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was in keeping with this zoning principle that Senator Abdulahi Adamu and Senator lyorchia Ayu emerged as the national chairman of the APC and the PDP, respectively.\n\nHe added that they are totally against the idea of another Northerner succeeding Buhari \u201cbecause it is a direct invitation for the aggravation of crises, conflicts, separatist demands by various sections of the country, among other unimaginable violence.\u201d\n\nAddressing Southeast politicians who they say are sabotaging the agitation for presidency to come to the region, the forum said, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the Igbo Elders Consultative Forum will not only pursue to a logical conclusion the sanctions of these shameless renegades and booth leakers, who accept to be running mates to any presidential candidate not from the South as well as those who are working hard to sabotage our efforts masquerading as coordinators and promoters of presidential aspirants outside the South East zone, but also curse them and their families publicly,\u201d he said",

However, the remaining N50 got missing.\n\nAccording to a report by SaharaReporters, a retired customs officer identified as Ajenifuja Kudirat has been accused of cutting off the finger of a 10-year-old girl, Hawau Ibrahim for allegedly stealing N50.\n\nAccording to a mandated reporter, Ajenifuja had sent Ibrahim on an errand and ordered the young girl to take the money from the top of the refrigerator. The victim reportedly took N200 from the N250 kept at the spot. However, the remaining N50 got missing.\n\nThe retired officer reportedly accused Ibrahim of theft which the little girl denied.

By the time the victim returned from where Kudirat sent her, she asked her for the missing N50, and the victim told her she didn\u2019t take the money.\n\n\u201cImmediately Ajenifuja Kudirat dragged the 10-year-old girl inside her room, brought out a machete and chopped off one of her fingers.\n\n\u201cThe victim\u2019s mother is crying bitterly for justice because the missing N50 was found and the perpetrator, Ajenifuja Kudirat still boasted to the victim\u2019s mother that no police could arrest her.

          "text": "The number of those aspiring to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform has risen to 21 from the initial 17 that had earlier declared their intention, Blueprint can authoritatively report.\n\nThis followed the entrance into the race of Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi, Jigawa state Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, a former national APC chairman and former Edo state Governor, Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole and Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Godswill Akpabio.\n\nThis is coming few days after the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, said the party had not yet decided on zoning its presidential ticket to any part of the country.\n\nBefore now, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, Ebonyi state Governor Dave Umahi, Pastor Tunde Bakare, Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of Transport Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige, and nine others had announced their bid to succeed the incumbent president whose tenure expires May 29, 2023.\n\nFayemi\n\nDeclaring his presidential bid Wednesday in Abuja, Governor Fayemi promised to decentralise governance if elected.\n\nFayemi, who is also the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), expressed confidence he would pick the APC presidential ticket either by direct or indirect primary election.\n\nGovernor Fayemi said his entry into the race to succeed President Buhari would offer APC members and Nigerians the opportunity to examine competing visions for national rebirth in the best interest of our country.\n\n\u201cCompatriots, it is in the spirit of this abiding faith in our country and the promise of its unfinished greatness that I stand before you today, in total humility and with all sense of responsibility, to solemnly declare to all our party cadres and Nigerians at large, my decision to accept for my name to be put forward for consideration by the APC leadership and membership as the party\u2019s standard bearer in the upcoming contest for a successor to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cThis is not a decision which I have taken lightly. Indeed, to arrive at this point, I carried out a long and deep self-introspection with the help of close family, friends, and colleagues, including my wife and devoted partner, Erelu Bisi Fayemi. I have also traversed the length and breadth of our country to consult and explore with our esteemed elder statesmen and women, traditional rulers, a cross section of party leaders and rank and file members, and various non-partisan leaders of thought and opinion.\n\n\u201cAnd it is on the foundation of a clear vision accompanied by a carefully thought out programme of action that I present my candidature. I do so fully convinced on the basis of what I have experienced, heard, and seen about the demands of the times and the aspirations of our people that the agenda that I am proposing for our country is one which will find favour with APC members and win resounding traction with the generality of Nigerians,\u201d Governor Fayemi said.\n\nSpeaking on his agenda for Nigeria, the former minister of mines and steel proposed Integrated Security System to solve challenges of insecurity confronting the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo give full effect to this, concrete programmes of action will be launched in priority areas that will allow for a revamping of the credibility of the Nigerian state, the promotion of an enhanced social contract, and the revamping of the national identity.\n\n\u201cProgrammatically, as the standard bearer of the APC, I will be leading the implementation of a wholistic and integrated response to the multifaceted security crises confronting us. To this end, the retooling of our armed forces, intelligence agencies, and border guards will be pursued in tandem with an overhaul of our policing system and the phasing in of bold universal social policies that will enable us decisively to tackle poverty and upgrade human capital and security.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how to tackle impunity, Fayemi said: \u201cWhat is also lacking in Nigeria is the leadership, the courage to do that what is right. Some people consider themselves as principalities and people who believe that they are the owners of this country, and then do whatever they like. They also believe that the law cannot catch up with them.\n\n\u201cWe will not be arbitrary but we would be very very sneaky about upholding the rule of law, and access to justice to all Nigerians. There are different levels of impunity.\n\n\u201cImpunity reigns because our justice system has been crippling and because the entire justice sector system in our country is problematic. If we look at the journey from the investigation of the crime, to conviction of the crime you would have forgotten that the person actually committed the crime.\n\n\u201cI think swift delivery of justice, access to justice, accountability in society are areas we need to pay attention to. We need to also support our judicial officers, so that we will not again tempt them to resort to other misbehaviour because the state has not taken on its own responsibility in terms of remuneration, in terms of support to the judicial officers.\u201d\n\nOn his choice of mode of primary, the governor said: \u201cPresident Buhari is known for its passion for every member of the party having a say in the decision that affects the party. So in that sense, I have no problem stalking a claim to a primary process, whether it\u2019s indirect or direct. I don\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d\n\n\u2026Oshiomhole too\n\nIn a similar declaration Wednesday in Abuja, a former APC national chairman, Comrade Oshiomhole, promised to reposition Nigeria and return her to the path of sustainable growth and development.\n\nPromising to create the enabling environment for an egalitarian society in the country, Oshiomhole listed as top priorities the creation of a job creation, healthcare facilities, security and qualitative education for the citizenry if voted into power.\n\nThe former Edo state governor promised to review the tax system which would compel the rich to pay higher monies required to address the basic needs of the downtrodden in the country.\n\nThe Edo-born politician promised to enforce use of textiles and fabrics, tyres and automobiles assembled and manufactured in Nigeria as part of measures aimed at creating employment opportunities for Nigerians.\n\nApplauding the measures put in place by the Buhari-led administration to address the multifaceted challenges besetting the country, he promised to address the issues relating to poor emoluments of the teachers as well as workers in the public sector.\n\n\u201cLet us forget our religious and tribal differences. My presidency would focus on policy issues that would deliver jobs, prosperity for Nigerians. We will deal with the issues of insecurity. I will assemble a cream of left of the centre economist to fix the economy. Together we will create a prosperous and secure Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nBadaru\n\nIn yet another declaration Wednesday also in Abuja, Jigawa state Governor Badaru Abubakar said he was eminently qualified for the job.\n\nThe governor, who already picked the N100million Expression of Interest and Nomination forms, was quoted as saying during the party\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 meeting at Government House Dutse Tuesday evening that \u201cI will join the presidential race since everyone knows I\u2019m a highly qualified person to do the job.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe governor was also said to have told the gathering during the meeting that he was pressurised to contest for the presidential seat by his colleagues.\n\n\n\nHis media aide, Auwalu Sankara, said his principal sought President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s blessings before buying the form.\n\nOsinbajo in Adamawa, Taraba\n\nAlso in continuation of his nationwide consultation, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said there is no greater privilege than to have the opportunity to give one\u2019s best in the service of the country, contributing to society and making life better for the people.\n\nA statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity Office of the Vice President Laolu Akande quoted Osinbajo as saying this Wednesday during his visits to Taraba and Adamawa states.\n\nThe visits were in continuation of his engagements with stakeholders and delegates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) across the country.\n\nThe VP was received in both States by their governors, Darius Ishaku and Umaru Fintiri of Taraba and Adamawa states respectively, as well other senior state government officials.\n\nSpeaking at the Lamido Adamawa\u2019s palace, Osinbajo said: \u201cMy reason for aspiring for the office of the President of Nigeria is to serve the Nigerian people. I have no other reason or objective except to serve.\n\n\u201cAfter one has been in office as Vice President for 7 years, I know that God did not give me that opportunity so that I would seat down somewhere and write the history of my service as Vice President.\n\n\u201cIt is for the purpose of serving the people, and that is why I am so determined that if God gives me the opportunity to serve, the Nigerian people would realise indeed they have done the right thing by putting me in office because I would serve the country with everything, with all my heart and commitment.\u201d\n\nThe VP was received at the Palace of the Lamido of Adamawa, by His Royal Highness, Muhammadu Mustapha, who recalled the VP\u2019s chieftaincy title as the Jagaba of Adamawa. The monarch then prayed for the realisation of the VP\u2019s presidential aspiration.\n\n\u201cI hope your coming will add more light to Adamawa because you are the Jagaba of Adamawa. I hope you succeed in your efforts to become the President of this country. As long as when you\u2019re coming to Adamawa, and with your visit to my palace, this will encourage people to see that you are really the Jagaba of Adamawa,\u201d the Lamido said.\n\nAlso at the palace, Governor Fintiri welcomed the VP to the state, adding that \u201cwe pray that God will answer your heart\u2019s desires. I also hope that the APC delegates will see the reason to put a square peg in a square hole. I welcome you to Adamawa and I wish you the best of luck.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President thanked the monarch for his warm reception and prayed for his good health.\n\nHe also noted the continuing efforts of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari in addressing the diverse challenges facing the country.\n\nAddressing the delegates in both states, Osinbajo \u201cacknowledged all the support that has been offered towards his presidential bid, while again emphasising that his sole purpose for seeking the highest office of the land, was purely to serve Nigeria and give his best for the country.\u201d\n\nEmphasizing the importance of service to the people, Prof. Osinbajo stated that \u201cone of the very important things I want to share with delegates anywhere I go is that the role of the politician is an important one.\u201d\n\nAddressing the delegates during an interactive session, the VP expressed delight at the commendable support he\u2019s been receiving from the delegates across the states.\n\nIn Taraba, he told the reporters, \u201cwe have had fruitful discussions and robust engagements, and all of it is directed at various ways we can do good things for our country and how we can make progress. I think that the future looks very bright indeed.\u201d\n\nWomen in rally for Bello\n\nAnd in Akure, the Ondo state capital, women in their numbers converged to demonstrate their support for the candidacy of Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe women, who defied heavy rain Wednesday morning, took to the streets, chanting solidarity songs and carrying various placards with inscriptions such as \u201cYahaya Bello, the best man for the job\u201d, \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in zoning, this is one Nigeria\u201d, and \u201cYahaya Bello, hero of women inclusion\u201d, among others.\n\nThe women, members of over 700 groups across Nigeria, in the massive rally, tagged, \u201cSouth West Mega Women Rally for Yahaya Bello\u201d, said anyone who had the interest of Nigeria at heart would not be drumming the beats of zoning, but pray to God to give the country the best leader at this crucial point in history.\n\n\u201cRegardless of what political oppressors might have fed the public, it is an incontrovertible fact that Governor Bello has the capacity to build on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successes and tackle all challenges confronting Nigeria, headlong.\n\nThe women cut across different key sectors and professions such as banking, media, Nollywood, medical practice, including frontline entrepreneurs, market leaders, engineers and religious groups, among others.\n\nIn her remarks, leader of the South-West market movement for Yahaya Bello and National Vice President, Iyaloja of Nigeria, Princess Nike Aroloye, said the women of Nigeria were already looking beyond the primaries of the two parties.\n\n\u201cWe already see the ticket with Yahaya Bello. Once he gets it, we are marching straight to Aso Rock. All my market women are ready to support him. We will go everywhere for this cause. He has said we are important. We will give him the reward,\u201d she told journalists at the rally.\n\nNollywood actress, Rose Odika, who led other South-west female stars to the rally said, \u201cI have said it before, and I will repeat it here. Yahaya Bello is the one we will support. From all he has done for women and for his state in general, he is the one to beat. We will only support those who support us.\n\n\u201cIt has never happened before in the history of Nigeria for a leading presidential candidate to appoint a woman as the Director-General of his campaign.\u201d\n\nResponding, Director General Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation Hafsat Abiola-Costello said the dreams of her mother for a better Nigeria for Nigerian women would be actualised with a Yahaya Bello presidency.\n\n\u201cI am so happy that Nigerian women have decided, for once, to take their destinies in their hands by supporting that one Governor that has given them so much voice and has made the world to see how women can turn stone into bread in a troubled economy. He will do the same for Nigeria,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2026Party extends sale of nomination forms\n\nMeanwhile, the APC National Working Committee (NWC) Monday extended the party\u2019s sale of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the 2023 general elections to Tuesday, May 10, 2022.\n\nIn a revised timetable by APC National Organising Secretary Sulaiman Muhammad Argungu, the last day for submission of completed forms and accompanying documents is now slated for Wednesday, 11th May, 2022.\n\nAlso, Congresses to elect Local Government Area (LGA), State and National Delegates will now be held from Thursday, 12th May to Saturday, 14th May, 2022.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

We discussed the importance of laying the ground work to ensure peaceful and democratic elections next year and the full participation of Nigerian women and young people in all areas.\n\n\u201cWe also discussed the government\u2019s measures to address security challenges across the country.

It is a tragic reminder of terrorism scourge across West Africa and the Sahel,\u201d he said.\n\nHe emphasised the commitment of the UN to combat terrorism, violent extremism, organised crime, poverty, food insecurity.\n\nHe also commended Nigeria for its role in sustaining peace in Africa and beyond as well as playing the leading role in sustaining democracy on the African continent.\n\n\u201cI thank President Buhari for his unwavering support for the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission. We also discuss the other challenges that Nigeria is facing today. Nigeria is a pillar of continental and global cooperation and a steadfast part of the United Nations.\n\n\u201cFrom its vital support for peace keeping to its leadership in fighting for fairness in developing countries, to being home of my Deputy Secretary, Amina Mohammed, above all Nigeria is a country where Africa\u2019s promise and potential can come to vivid life,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if the pressure from Ukraine for humanitarian assistance affects UN supply to other nations in need like Niger Republic, he said: \u201cFrom the point of view of the United Nations, it does not affect. We have increased our actions in Ukraine, but we have not decreased our actions in all other parts of the world. And my appeal for those that support financially, United nations not to divert funds from other humanitarian and development funds of cooperation to the Ukraine crisis but to put additional contribution for that crisis not undermining the efforts in humanitarian and development cooperation that are taking place all around the world.\u201d\n\nThe UN Scribe, who had been in Borno state Tuesday, said what he saw was a departure from the pictures of hopelessness and despair painted, adding that \u201cpeople exuded hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday, I visited Maiduguri where the United Nations is supporting the internally displaced. I was deeply moved by their stories and struggles.\n\n\u201cThese include the struggles with hunger, with the World Food Programme projecting 4.1 million people in the North East of Nigeria to be food insecure in the upcoming lean season,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut despite all they have seen and endured, the people I met remained hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives. To that end, I welcome the establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Returns and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North East,\u201d the UN scribe said.\n\nHe said the war in Ukraine will make things worse on global food, energy and financial systems, adding:\u201cThat\u2019s why, in the earliest days of this war, I established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, involving all UN Agencies and international financial institutions. The Steering Committee is chaired by Deputy Secretary General, Amina Mohammed.\u201d\n\nBuhari\n\nReceiving the UN scribe, President Buhari said Nigeria was grateful to the United Nations and some world leaders on their steadfast partnership in fighting terrorism.\n\nHe said the spotlight on Russia and Ukraine could easily distract from other pertinent global challenges.\n\nPresident Buhari said the country and the African continent were already concerned that the attention on Russia and Ukraine would crowd out other issues, but the ongoing visit of the UN scribe clearly showed that \u201cthe world has not forgotten us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we assumed office, the North-East was the major security problem we inherited in 2015, but we have been able to make people understand that you cannot kill people and shout \u2018Allahu Akbar,\u2019 (God is great!).\n\n\u201cIt is either you don\u2019t know what you are saying or you are simply stupid. God is a God of justice, so you cannot kill people and say God is great. Luckily the people understood our message and it has made great impact,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President told the UN scribe that the government had started a gradual, but steady process of resettlement and reintegration where citizens get encouraged to return to their farms, businesses and other pursuits in life.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",
          "summary": "Secretary General United Nations (UN) Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the agency was mobilising $321 million to support Nigeria\u2019s fight against insurgency in the North-eastern part of the country and address the humanitarian crisis.\nHe emphasised the commitment of the UN to combat terrorism, violent extremism, organised crime, poverty, food insecurity.\n\u201cI thank President Buhari for his unwavering support for the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission.\nNigeria is a pillar of continental and global cooperation and a steadfast part of the United Nations.\nThe Steering Committee is chaired by Deputy Secretary General, Amina Mohammed.\u201dBuhariReceiving the UN scribe, President Buhari said Nigeria was grateful to the United Nations and some world leaders on their steadfast partnership in fighting terrorism.",

So, some investors that could not buy Guinness Nigeria are moving to Nigerian Breweries, among other stocks on the NGX.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cForeign and local investors are taking advantage of undervalued stocks and the first quarter corporate earnings are fundamentals driving investors buy interest on the NGX.\u201d\n\nHowever, the market sentiment, as measured by market breadth closed positive as 31 stocks gained, relative to 27 losers.

          "text": "The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Wednesday said with all current market dynamics at play, the global oil supply market could have as much as 240 million barrels of emergency crude oil in the next six months.\n\nIt came against the backdrop of pressure from the United States and its allies on the organisation to ramp up global supply and indications that the cartel would supply plan unchanged during its meeting today.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the 62nd meeting of the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), meant to review oil market developments ahead of the conference, OPEC Secretary General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, maintained that the current non-fundamentals driving oil prices were beyond the body\u2019s control.\n\nSanusi noted that the Covid-19 pandemic clearly remained with the world as had been evident most recently with lockdowns across China, with its impact on transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstock.\n\nHe further highlighted the implications and the possible far-reaching consequences of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine which he said had compounded the uncertainties, leading to further economic volatility and elevated risk premiums for oil.\n\n\u201cThe crises we face are causing huge volatility, with daily price swings of more than $5/b occurring on 13 occasions across March and April.\n\n\u201cI must point out, however, that the non-fundamental factors are elements that we as producers have no control over. What we can do is what we have always done \u2013 and that is to continue collaborating through DoC actions to help support market stability and economic growth,\u201d he stated.\n\nRecalling the month of April 2020, Barkindo described it as perhaps the darkest and most sudden downturn in the history of the oil industry when global oil demand dropped by more than 20 million barrels a day (mb/d), and industries and populations locked down.\n\nThe Nigerian-born Barkindo reiterated that from the oil market perspective, what was clear was that Russia\u2019s oil and other liquids exports of more than 7 mb/d cannot be made up from elsewhere. \u201cThe spare capacity just does not exist,\u201d he stated. The statement was not unconnected to the demand from the West that Russia oil and gas should be cut off.\n\nHe urged global leaders to continue to support the type of multilateralism exhibited in the deal that returned some semblance of stability to the market in 2020 to ensure an unhindered, stable and secure flow of energy to the whole world.\n\nAccording to him, the events and challenges the world currently face were fluid and constantly evolving, promising that OPEC will continue to monitor events.\n\nBarkindo added that the assessment for 2022 had dropped from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent taking into account the implications of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as the ongoing effects of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cGlobal oil demand growth for 2021 remains similar to last month, at 5.7 mb/d, but 2022 growth has been revised down by 0.5 mb/d to stand at 3.7 mb/d. This mostly reflects the downward revision in world economic growth,\u201d he stressed.\n\nHe confirmed that the latest data showed that OPEC production conformity levels reached 157 per cent in March, and stand at 113 per cent overall since May 2020.\n\n\u201cAs of March 2022, participating countries were producing 2.37 mb more on a daily basis than in August of 2021. Some countries continue to produce under their agreed levels, with the shortfall at 1.45 mb/d in March,\u201d Barkindo said.\n\nHe urged members to be cognisant that commitments for the emergency release of oil stocks from International Energy Agency (IEA) members, amount to 120 million barrels to be released over a six-month period.\n\n\u201cThe US has agreed to contribute about 60 million barrels to this, part of a larger drawdown from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) announced on 31 March.\n\n\u201cTaken together, over the next six months, there could potentially be around 240 million barrels of emergency oil stocks, the equivalent of over 1 mb/d for a period of eight months, made available to the global market,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn the energy transition debate, Barkindo noted that what had been learnt in the last few months was that it was not about moving from one energy to another, but about utilising all available energies and understanding the energy security dimension of the future to enable the necessary investments.\n\n\u201cThis was clearly highlighted last month by US investment bank, JP Morgan in its first annual energy outlook. It said the world needs to find $1.3 trillion of incremental investment by 2030 to boost all types of energy output and infrastructure from renewables to oil and gas to avoid an energy crunch.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is a wake-up call to all stakeholders. We need to ensure there is a clear pathway for all energy investments. Sustained investment in oil is required if we are to expand production and ensure adequate spare capacity, a vital cog in the oil market landscape,\u201d Barkindo argued.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
