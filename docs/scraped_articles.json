This was after the bandits had threw their explosives on the roof top of the Orsu Police station.\n\nThe Police said: \u201cOn 5/8/2021 at about 2135 hours, armed bandits, in their numbers attacked and threw explosives and petrol bombs on top of the roof of Orsu Police station damaging the roof and causing fire outbreak in the station which spread and affected some of the vehicles parked at the parking lot.\n\n\u201cThe command\u2019s tactical teams on ground engaged the bandits in a gun duel. And due to the superior fire power of the police the bandits were subdued. Three of the bandits were neutralized and their guns, one pump action gun and two locally made double barrel pistols were recovered while others escaped into the bush with bullet wounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a police inspector lost his life in the attack. Meanwhile, the command is using this medium to call on the good people of Imo State especially, the Orsu community to assist the police with credible information that will lead to the arrest of the escaped bandits and to report to the nearest police station any person seen with or treating bullet wounds. Also hospitals are advised to ensure that they report any person who come to them for treatment of bullet wounds,\u201d Police said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Tasks host communities on effective mgt of 3% equity\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nChief Sylva with the Ijaw elders after decorating him with a royal attire.\n\nThe Federal Government has disclosed of its resolve to again engage oil producing host communities in the Niger Delta on issues regarding the 3 per cent of operational costs allocated to them in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB.\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva disclosed this Thursday in Abuja when a group of Ijaw elders, leaders and critical stakeholders visited him to congratulate him on the passage of the PIB after 20 years.\n\nSylva who tasked host communities on effective management of the funds lamented the situation where communities in the Bonny Island cannot access funds paid to them by the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company NLNG following court cases instituted by some individuals.\n\nHe also said he has extracted the commitment of multinational oil firms to relocate their operational headquarters to the Niger Delta and urged the elders to continue to sensitize communities on the need to secure public assets in their areas.\n\nThe minister said; \u201cWe are planning, alongside the Minister of Information to hold town hall meetings in the host communities after the presidential assent to the PIB. We need to have more stakeholders engagement on the three per cent allocated to the communities. People need to know that it is from production costs and not from profit. The production cost is always higher than the profits.\n\n\u201cToday, I can tell you authoritatively that we are on the last mile of the oil economy. Economies around the world are now discussing renewable fuel.\n\n\u201cWe must understand that very soon we might wake up and find out that oil is not as valuable a commodity as we thought before.\n\n\u201cCoal did not finish before the world moved away from coal. There is still a lot of coal deposit in Enugu today but if you give some of it to someone, he might not appreciate it because the world has moved away from coal.\n\n\u201cWe must support every effort to ensure that the oil we have today is produced and sold so that we can get the benefits.\n\n\u201cFor the past 20 years we have been struggling to pass the PIB and that introduces a lot of uncertainties in the horizon because when you are in the process of amending your laws, investors would hold on to see what the amendment will be.\n\n\u201cThat was why since the last 20 years, investments in the sector was on hold.

          "text": "Says misinformation on bill political\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nThe Federal Government said, Thursday, that the misinformation on the controversial Water Resources Bill was deliberate and political.\n\nIt also listed seven states to benefit from the first tranche of the World Bank\u2019s $700 million for specific water projects in the country. The states include Imo, Delta, Bauchi, Ekiti, Katsina, Kaduna and Plateau.\n\nIt would be recalled that opposition had trailed the Water Resources Bill, which many stakeholders described as a ploy by the Federal Government to take over control of waterways from state governments to provide water for grazing purposes.\n\nBut addressing State House correspondents on the scorecard of his ministry at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, yesterday, the Minister of Water Resources, Sulaiman Adamu, insisted that government had taken a firm decision to regulate the water delivery system, saying no data existed to effectively reform the sector.\n\nHe also said he had lobbied the Nigeria Governors Forum on the matter.\n\nAdamu said: \u201cWe\u2019re still working with the National Assembly on this bill. I think probably they were so engrossed with the PIB (Petroleum Industry Bill) and the Electoral Act Bill, which are, of course, serious national priorities, and they were not able to come to talk about it.\n\n\u201cBut already, we have done all the things that needed to be done. The issue that was raised, the technical issue about gazetting, had been addressed. So the bill is still before the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cObviously, I have said so much about this bill, people have been deliberately misinformed. The bill was deliberately politicised unnecessarily, something that is good for the development of the country.\n\n\u201cIn any case, 96, 97 per cent of the provisions in that bill are already existing in four different laws. Water Resources Act 2004; Nigeria Hydrological Services Act; River Basin Development Authorities Act; and the National Water Resources Institute Act.\n\n\u201cThe first purpose of bringing this bill was to put all these bills under one booklet, instead of having four separate laws, just consolidate them into one statute. That is number one.\n\n\u201cNumber two is that Nigeria, like all other countries in the world, has adopted the concept of Integrated Water Resources Management. And that is why today, we\u2019re enjoying the category two UNESCO centre of Integrated River Basin Management that is based in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cIt is a centre of excellence, funded by UNESCO to promote integrated River Basin Management and we are getting people from all parts of West Africa to come and learn about River Basin management there.\n\n\u201cSo on the basis of that, powers that were hitherto vested in the Minister of Water Resources, are being devolved to the communities, to stakeholders within the basins.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that whereas on the basis of the Water Resources Act that is existing, I as minister can\u2019t determine where any project can be put without any recourse to anybody. Under this new Integrated Water Resources Management concept, we\u2019ll have to go down and talk to the communities involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to have their buy in, we have to agree so we\u2019ll have to hold town hall meetings, we have to set up catchment management committees. The Integrated Water System Management Commission that is saddled with that responsibility was set up in 2007.\n\n\u201cThis is the organisation that provides licensing, you cannot get a licence to have a power plant without a water licence. Right? That\u2019s what is happening now through the Integrated Water Management Commission. So, there is also a provision within the bill to strengthen this agency.\n\n\u201cAll the people that are mining water have to go there to get a water licence and pay a tariff, it is gazetted by law. But right now, they are operating on the basis of delegated powers of the minister. And what we want is for them to stand alone, that means I can withdraw this delegated powers anytime and apply them myself.\n\n\u201cBut if we have what we have provided in the bill, there will be independence, like the National Electricity Regulatory Commission. They will not be answerable to the Minister, they will be answerable to the people.\n\n\u2018\u2019The bill provides that the commission will have members nominated by the president, cleared by the National Assembly, they have to be confirmed by the National Assembly and they will be representative of all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\n\u201cSo, we are democratising the process of Water Resources development in this country. And some people went to town and say we want to cheat people. The exact thing of what this bill is trying to do is what is being fed into the minds of people. And I don\u2019t understand why.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked, we\u2019ve talked and we\u2019ll keep talking. Well, we\u2019re committed to this. This bill, by the way, was drafted in 2006. The Buhari administration came in 2015. So it\u2019s something we met, just like our ongoing project, is exactly what we met.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to continue where others failed. And the bill went to the Federal Executive Council and it was approved in September 2016.\u201d\n\nThe minister also listed seven states that would benefit from the first tranche of World bank\u2019s $700 million facility for specific water projects.\n\nHe said the states would access between $50 and $60 million, having met the criteria set up by the World Bank to do so.\n\n\u201cSome certain criteria were set up by the World Bank and us. And the states had to meet this eligible criteria. And the projects are submitted into tier one and tier two. Tier one is for those that will get a substantial amount, maybe $50, $60 million for the urban schemes,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "My name is RTD Major/Gen.A.O.Aladenola. The journey of my diabetes started on a terrific Tuesday morning. I received an emergency call from my superior officer to attend a security briefing in Abuja the next morning which is Tuesday. I woke up early to catch up with the early morning flight; that 45 minutes journey was the beginning of my predicament.\n\nI visited the rest room 5 times which became very embarrassing. Ultimately I knew something was wrong and as I put a call through to my doctor, I was advised to immediately go to hospital.\n\nImmediately I managed to finish my meeting which was another embarrassing moment, I checked into our base hospital where a comprehensive checkup was conducted on me and it was discovered that I had diabetes and my sugar level was 385mg. I was admitted and placed on insulin. That was how the journey started and it has been a terrific one \u2013 injecting myself everyday with dosage of insulin.\n\nThe situation got worsened when I had a wound on my leg which later became sore. At a point, my leg was considered to be amputated but I refused blatantly and I travelled to India, Saudi Arabia and UK, but all to no avail. The predicament led to my early retirement from the Military.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMY ENCOUNTER WITH NKHAMBI\n\nMy Childhood friend Charles was in the know of my ordeal with diabetes. He called me one fateful day and informed me about what he saw on the page of a Newspaper concerning diabetes and sent a number to call but I didn\u2019t bother till about a week later when my nurse came to the house for the routine treatment of my leg.\n\nReluctantly I put a call through and explained my predicament to the fellow who assured me that I will be well and the sore will heal up.\n\nI was told that I will use the medication for 6 months for total cure, but within 2 months the sore will heal up. He sounded very convincing. So I ordered for 2 months\u2019 treatment. The first thing I noticed when I commenced the medication was that it helped to free my bowel and anytime I visited to toilet, what comes out of me was unexplainable.\n\nAfter 3 weeks on the medication, the sore was drying up and my nurse was also shocked \u2013 all other symptoms like my blurry vision and tingling sensations on my feet were subsiding. But what shocked me to the marrow was that within 7 weeks of administering NKHAMBI the SORE totally healed up and my sugar came down to 115 \u2013 120mg.\n\nI ordered for the complete dosage as advised, and after 4 months I started eating what I desired without restriction and all symptoms of diabetes had vanished; no more fluctuation of blood sugar.\n\nNow I am well and healthy after 18 years of battling diabetes which almost claim my leg. Thanks to NKHAMBI and I recommend it for anybody having any type of DIABETES.\n\nABOUT NKHAMBI\n\nNKHAMBI is a composition of carefully selected herbs across three (3) continents and is formulated into capsules under highly hygienic condition. This medication helps to rejuvenate the cells in the Pancreas that produces insulin in the body. Human bodies uses insulin to take the sugar from carbohydrates we eat and convert to energy that the body requires.\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS\n\n\u2022TRIGONELLA FEONUM-GRAECUM\n\n\u2022GYMNEMA SYLVESTRE\n\n\u2022PANAX SPP\n\n\u2022CINNAMOMUM CASSIA VERUM\n\nDIABETES INDICATION\n\n\n\n\u2022Frequent Urination\n\n\u2022Blurry Vision\n\n\u2022Weight loss\n\n\u2022Numb and Tingly of Feet or Hands\n\n\u2022Thirstiness and Hunger\n\nThou there are cases when a chronic increases in blood sugar for a while may not have such typical for diabetes manifestation but early detection and treatment is always advised.\n\n\u2022FOR ORDER PLACEMENT OF THIS DRUG: Call 09053333458 OR 07037318531\n\nWhatsApp: +2347037318531\n\nMake payment to account details\n\n1020932254\n\nA&B HERBAL ENTERPRISES.\n\nUBA",

          "text": "By Tunde Rahman\n\nWhy do many political opponents dread the All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, so much so that in their wishful thinking they hope he gives way or simply quit the stage? Why should political contestation get to the point where our so-called political leaders would be wishing their competitors dead if they are actually in politics for the public good? These are some of the questions that have agitated my mind following the repeated unfounded rumours about Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s health status. In the last few months, the former Lagos governor has died many times over in the reckoning of these nefarious persons.\n\nEach time Asiwaju travels, the next thing these detractors, who abound in PDP as in APC, do is to shamelessly claim he is seriously ill undergoing surgery or that he has died. Yet, each time they have made such blatant claims, the lie has always blown up on their very faces, as they have always been proven wrong.\n\nSurprisingly, some of these evil persons would also claim the APC national leader is no longer relevant in the scheme of things in the party he helped form. And you wonder: if he is no longer important within the APC, why dissipating energies about him? Why hoping he dies each time he steps out of the country?\n\nThese people have been in this despicable game for quite a while. They have perpetrated so much hatred and told too many lies such that to track them can be a herculean task. Let me attempt a recall of a few of these. In April this year, when we went for Umrah (lesser Hajj) in Saudi Arabia, they brought out a photo-shopped photograph that portrayed Asiwaju in very bad light. The picture was so bad that you would wonder whether it had any feature of him. All that these malicious people wanted to demonstrate is Asiwaju is so badly ill or incapacitated that he cannot even aspire to lead this country, talk less mount the exalted office. Ironically, at the same lesser Hajj, Asiwaju, who the malevolent imagined dead, effortlessly performed tawaf (going round the holy Kabbah) several times and underwent all the rites of Umrah. I was in that entourage to Umrah along with some of his friends and associates including Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, former EFCC Chairman Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, and former National Welfare Officer of APC, Alhaji Ibrahim Masari, among others.\n\nElucidating on how we arrived in Medina around 4 am, how tired, weary and needing sleep we all proceeded to Mecca, a distance of 4-and-a-half hours, that same morning we landed in the kingdom, and how on eventual arrival in Mecca we immediately headed for the Kabbah, would help put a lie to the claim about Asiwaju\u2019s ill-health.\n\nThe journey from Medina to Mecca by road was very strenuous. Virtually all of us slept. Not Asiwaju. He was awake throughout, conversing with the driver, Mustapha, and ensuring he was awake and alert for the duration of the drive. We arrived in Mecca without any hassle, quickly checked into a hotel, and then headed for the Kabbah for tawaf and other rites of Umrah. Leading the charge, Asiwaju Tinubu painlessly performed the seven-round tawaf and shortly after, being a Friday, it was time for Jummah. We left Medina immediately we arrived because way back in that holy city, Asiwaju had insisted he would like to observe Jummah in Mecca.\n\nFor the duration of the trip, Asiwaju\u2019s hotel suite in Mecca was turned into a Mecca of sort with governors, ministers, other top dignitaries and Islamic clerics coming to visit him. Overlooking the Kabbah, it was in his living room that we were observing some of the prayers and making supplications to Allah.\n\nMany took selfies with him with their cameras and phones unencumbered. He allowed as many as wanted to take photographs with him to do so, an opportunity some abused. An example was someone who either unknowingly deployed a phone with a bad camera or deliberately doctored the photograph, which was now used to achieve nefarious ends, as depicted by that damaging picture of Asiwaju in Saudi.\n\nAgain, not long after we returned from Umrah and the former Lagos governor undertook a trip abroad, I think to France and UK, there were also unfounded reports that he had been hospitalised in Paris for alleged coronavirus attack and had even purportedly undergone an operation. Some proceeded from there to claim he had died. Now, Asiwaju has never tested positive for COVID-19. Not at that alleged time, not at present. For the life of me, how could someone who had never been positive for coronavirus be hospitalised for it or undergone a surgery for complications arising from the virus he never contracted? I volunteered this much not to disparage many who had contracted the virus or those presently battling the dreaded menace.\n\nEach time we felt we had over-exposed ourselves or someone had contracted the virus in the team, we would call for coronavirus tests and no one is exempted. Asiwaju and some of us must have undergone close to 15 COVID-19 tests each. Some of us, including this writer, had even tested positive for the virus at one point or another. Asiwaju has never experienced it once.\n\nThe fake news about Asiwaju\u2019s alleged ill health or death is something we have become accustomed to each time he travels out of the country such that it has become a joke of sorts. Indeed, we had a hilarious encounter when he embarked on the extant travel some two weeks ago. As I made to leave him at the Lagos airport, I said: \u201cSir, now that you are traveling again, when these mischievous guys begin to say you are either dying or dead, what do I say to them?\u201d We had a good laugh. He then said: \u201cJust say I have travelled and don\u2019t mind whatever they say.\u201d\n\nSo the speculation trailing the extant trip is what it is: fake, unfounded news. It bears repeating, however, to state that Asiwaju is hale and hearty. He is not in any hospital. He does not have any medical situation that would require hospitalisation either in Nigeria or abroad.\n\nIt is sad that perpetrators of this mischief are not deterred by the fact that each time this fake news has been propagated they have been proven wrong.\n\nHowever, there are a few points to make at this juncture. Firstly, some speak magisterially on the state of health of Asiwaju Tinubu. They say he doesn\u2019t enjoy good health. Are they his doctors? Are they saying they are privy to his medical records? Pray, how could an unhealthy man muster the strength and energy to go through the rigors of tawaf and all rites associated with Umrah immediately after a six-hour flight and over four-hour road trip?\n\nThose perpetrating this evil think they are unknown. They hide their identities behind the anonymity of the social media. But we have a fair idea who they are. Their luck will run out soon as they would be exposed sooner than later!\n\nAgain, these people who try to rubbish Asiwaju\u2019s health, peddling rumours that he is dead forget that the matter of life and death is within the realm of God. Not of any individual. They should not attempt to play God. They conveniently forgot what many dubbed the Zik\u2019s curse. Recall that Nigeria\u2019s first president and one of our foremost leaders, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, was rumoured dead I think around November 1989. Some prominent print media organisations and television stations published the story without conducting due diligence and checks. With banner headlines cast in impressive adjectives befitting the Great Zik, they proudly proclaimed the nationalist dead. Some of Zik\u2019s associates, some of whom had not seen him in years, particularly the late Chief RBK Okafor, also fell for it, ranting about their close relationship with the late nationalist and how they were with him in his last moments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReminiscing on this episode in an article titled \u201cThe Day Zik Didn\u2019t Die\u201d published by THE NATION newspaper on November 8, 2016, celebrated columnist, Professor Olatunji Dare, had this to say: \u201cOut-of-work politicians\n\nsaw an opening and moved in swiftly. A First Republic legislator and former stalwart of the Zikist Movement, Chief RBK Okafor, panting as if he had sprinted all the way from Nsukka to Rutam House in Lagos, narrated breathlessly how he had cradled his \u201cbeloved Zik\u201d in his arms and how, even as his life ebbed, the great nationalist had said to him: \u201cChief RBK Okafor, my political son, remember that I am a Pan-Africanist and should be given a Pan-African burial.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, Zik\u2019s rumoured death was false. It was fake news. Zik did not die. At least he did not die at that time. He read that obituary in the newspapers. He also reportedly cursed those people grandstanding over his purported death. And one by one, they died before him. Zik went on to live for another seven years. The long and short of all of this is those wishing Asiwaju dead, hoping to profit from it should be very careful. They should be wary of the wrath of God.\n\nHaving stated all of that, my final point is media stakeholders must meet minds together and devise a way to halt the excesses of the social media. We must help to stem this menace of fake news, hate speech and abusive language. There must be a form of regulation for this nonsense going on, on social media. I\u2019m totally in support of peer regulation, regulation within the media industry itself, but we must scale up enforcement of this regulation. Why don\u2019t we draft the regulations ourselves and approach the National Assembly for legislation to back them up to make these regulations institutional as some professionals have also suggested?",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) Board of Trustees (BoT), yesterday, set up a panel to resolve the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe committee comprising governors, members of the BoT, National Assembly caucus of PDP, the National Working Committee, former governors and ministers is expected to report back within 72 hours.\n\nFormer Senate president, David Mark, told newsmen the committee was needed not just to resolve issues related to recent resignation of seven deputy national officers but to make PDP more united.\n\nHe also denied rumour that Governor Nyesom Wike of River was summoned to the meeting, saying he attended in his capacity as a member of the board.\n\nAsked if the current NWC would be allowed to complete its tenure, former Senate president, Dr. Bukola Saraki, said the committee members would meet between 48 to 72 hours for way forward.\n\nHe advised against making point out of who attended the meeting for the first time, saying as a member, he was attending for the first time for long time.\n\n\u201cWe all came together to addresses some issues and because of the urgency of the matter, we agreed to set up this committee urgently.\n\n\u201cWithin the next 48 hours to 72 hours the committee will meet and at the end of the meeting, the country will see the direction the party is going.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of everybody to attend this meeting and subject themselves to the decision of the meeting shows the interest of everybody.\n\n\u201cThe presence of all of us here is because this meeting of today is important in addressing some of those issues.\n\n\u201cMy message to Nigerians is that we know the importance of this party to this nation in addressing the challenges ahead of us. So, let us come together as a party and salvage this country,\u201d Saraki said.\n\nThe BoT Chairman, Sen. Walid Jibrin, in his remark said now was the right time for PDP to put its house in order, to enable it prepare for its upcoming elective convention for the election of its national leaders, as well as prepare for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve complete success, we must do away with any personal interest and unnecessary in-house fighting, capable of killing the objectives set by the party.\u201d\n\nHe said the board must look critically at the party approved organs, advising all to wake up by functioning very well, in order to fulfil the dreams of PDP\u2019s forefathers.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, it is very important therefore, that the BoT being the conscience of the party, must today come up with necessary strategy for election of our national leadership, based on free and fair election that will produce credible and competent officers of our party,\u201d he said.\n\nJibrin noted that the BoT was always ready to listen to any group, committee, or individual with good intentions for the party, aimed at promoting peace and unity in PDP and Nigeria.\n\nHe urged members to put their collective interest ahead any personal interests in making sure that PDP new leaders emerged only through free and fair election at the national convention.\n\n\u201cThere is also need to take a firm stand to drastically reduce suits by aggrieved members, by following procedures enshrined in the PDP constitution, before referring any matter to court.\n\n\u201cAnyone that takes the party to court should be seriously disciplined,\u201d he said.\n\nJibrin stressed the need to look at why many past PDP national chairmen, Chief Audu Ogbeh, Chief Okwesilieze Nwodo, Alhaji Bamanga Tukur, Alhaji Ahmed Mua\u2019zu and Alhaji Alimodu Sheriff, did not complete their tenures successfully.\n\n\u201cWe must sit with the national chairman and the NWC to come out with decisions that will make our party strongest. While truth is bitter, we must cope with the bitterness by taking serious actions to handle this situation.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that he had completed all arrangements with the PDP Governor\u2019s Forum, the National Assembly Caucus and Forum of State Chairmen, for effective consultation on the way forward for the party.\n\nPDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, said the meeting was critical not only for members of the NWC but the entire PDP. He added that it was time for the party to brace up and come out strong and even stronger.\n\n\u201cI believe that in every human endeavour where there are issues, the issues must be tabled, discussed and come out with solutions. That solution will make our party very strong,\u201d Secondus said.\n\nBriefing on the state of the party, including the pending congress in nine states, Secondus said the reconciliation committee had done great work in Plateau and Niger. He said for the remaining states, forms were being sold to those who wanted to contest.\n\nSecondus said that after the state congresses, PDP was looking forward to a smooth and peaceful convention coming up in December, adding that the office of the national organising secretary was already preparing.\n\n\u201cSoon, the schedule of events, timetable and others shall be presented before the caucus, BoT, NEC and all organs of our party for action, leading to the convention,\u201d Secondus said.\n\nOn the seven deputy members of principal working committee of the party that resigned, he said the NWC met them on the day they tendered their letters.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP deputy national publicity secretary, Diran Odeyemi, has withdrawn his resignation letter.\n\nOdeyemi, who was one of the seven deputy national officers, who tendered their resignation letters, on Tuesday, said his decision was because of the activation of internal conflict resolution mechanism by the PDP leader.\n\nIn a letter dated August 4, 2021 and addressed to the PDP National Secretary,Odeyemi said:\n\n\u201cI write to withdraw my letter of Resignation as the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of our great party.\n\n\u201cThis decision is taken in view of the activation of the internal method of resolving issues by our leaders across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI also wish to state expressly that whatever embarrassment the resignation has caused the party, its leaders, members and supporters is highly regretted.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, in view of the fact that the tenure of myself and other members of the present National Working Committee (NWC) will expire in another three months, it is my view that the boat should not be rocked under any guise.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I pledge my loyalty and commitment to the party and the Prince Uche Secondus led NWC, and will continue to play my roles to ensure a successful National Convention, which will usher in new national officers.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nFederal Government has threatened to sack resident doctors who withdrew their services nationwide since August 2 over alleged poor conditions of service.\n\nGovernment said it was considering the option of outright termination of employment if they failed to return to their duty posts.\n\nThe threat was contained in a letter by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Health, Abdullaziz Abdullahi, and addressed to the doctors through their umbrella body, the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD).\n\nGovernment said it would, probably, leverage on court judgment delivered by Justice Oluwakayode Olosegbe of Enugu branch of the National Industrial Court (NIC) to take its administrative actions if the doctors failed to return to work.\n\nIt, thus, reminded the striking doctors that the industrial court judgment indicated that they have no right to embark on strike for certain reasons.\n\nIt asked the aggrieved doctors to abide by the court judgment and return to their duty posts, while other means were being used to resolve the issue.\n\nNARD President, Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, confirmed to Daily Sun that the letter from Federal Ministry of Health was received, yesterday, and their lawyers were working on the matter.\n\nHe said: \u201cUnfortunately, instead of government to find a means of resolving the issues and finding permanent solution to the problem, they are busy looking for court judgment to bar us from legitimately seeking our rights. We are not deterred by their threats.\n\n\u201cWe are well organised union, and we are committed to providing medical services to Nigerians. But we can only do that if we are taken care of. However, our lawyers are working on the matter. So, the nationwide strike continues, and we are impressed with the compliance level by all the chapters.\u201d\n\nMedical doctors under the umbrella of NARD began the nationwide strike on August 2 to press for some demands regarding their welfare and conditions of service.\n\nIn a related development, government accused the striking medical doctors of allowing themselves and their association to be used by enemies to cause instability in the health sector.\n\nMinister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, said the industrial action was needless as the government was fully committed to issues that concern them, particularly their welfare and conditions of service.\n\nEhanire explained that the doctors are fully aware of the efforts of the government to meet their needs, but choosing to embark on strike was unacceptable and a deliberate effort to cause unnecessary disruption in the health care system.\n\nHe said some of the requests of the doctors are not within the powers of the Federal Government to solve because health is in concurrent list, meaning that federal and states governments have equal powers to make decisions on health related matters.\n\nHe said: \u201cHealth is an item on the residual legislative list of the constitution. It means federal and state governments, each has separate powers, over which National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) has been advised to meet with the respective state governments, who are independent employers of some NARD members at state hospitals, in their own right, to resolve matters of specific concern between them.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has always, proactively, engaged NARD to seek solutions to their complaints, and I can, in this regard, comfortably state that, of the 12 resolutions of NARD\u2019s National Executive meeting of June 25, that were submitted to us, only five issues are related to the Federal Government.\n\nResolutions 6-12 are actually strictly employers/employee issues that ought to be resolved at individual state government level, at which the Federal Ministry of Health has no jurisdiction, and, as such, do not merit nationwide industrial action.\n\n\u201cThese are: (1) Salary arrears owed resident doctors in state hospitals, (2) Domestication of medical Residency Training Act (MRTA by state governments (3) Speedy release of MRTA approved funds by states, (4) Minimum Wage- Adjusted CONMESS 2019, (5) Payment of COVID-19 inducement allowance by states, (6) Accreditation of unaccredited departments in States Training Institutions, (7) Central Posting of House Officers in States institutions.\u201d\n\nThe minister insisted that dialogue is always the best approach to conflict resolution and the Federal Government has always been prompt in attending to labour issues in the health sector whenever it occurs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on record that the reason(s) for industrial actions declared by NARD has been discussed extensively with NARD and implementation of the resolutions adopted by both the NARD and government agencies, led by the Federal Ministry of Health and Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, appeal to NARD not allow its association or themselves to be used by enemies of the country to cause instability in the health sector,\u201d the minister said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",
          "summary": "From Fred Ezeh, AbujaFederal Government has threatened to sack resident doctors who withdrew their services nationwide since August 2 over alleged poor conditions of service.\nThe threat was contained in a letter by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Health, Abdullaziz Abdullahi, and addressed to the doctors through their umbrella body, the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD).\nGovernment said it would, probably, leverage on court judgment delivered by Justice Oluwakayode Olosegbe of Enugu branch of the National Industrial Court (NIC) to take its administrative actions if the doctors failed to return to work.\nIt, thus, reminded the striking doctors that the industrial court judgment indicated that they have no right to embark on strike for certain reasons.\nNARD President, Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, confirmed to Daily Sun that the letter from Federal Ministry of Health was received, yesterday, and their lawyers were working on the matter.",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has lamented that at least 10 out of the 34 local government areas of the state are under siege of bandits and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201c\u2026With this situation in mind, there is no way we can sleep,\u201d Masari told the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt-Gen. Farouk Yahaya at the Government House, yesterday.\n\n\u201cIf we say we are happy here in Katsina, then we are not being honest. We are disturbed by this issue of banditry, with kidnappings, rape, armed robbery as everyday, we record at least one or two incidents.\n\n\u201cBut we thank God because if you compare the current situation with what was obtainable about six months ago, there is progress in restoring the situation to normalcy.\n\n\u201cAs I have often said, this issue is everybody\u2019s business. It is not only the business of security agencies. It is our collective responsibility to secure our communities.\n\n\u201cThese bandits are people who have been living peacefully with their neighbours for centuries but somewhere along the line, something went wrong and that is how we found ourselves in this situation.\n\n\u201cWe can overcome the situation and restore normalcy to our communities but this can only be possible with the cooperation of everybody including media operators.\n\n\u201cIf we want to depend solely on the security agencies, how many are they, compared to the population and the sheer size of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have amended our local government laws by creating a three-tier security system starting from the ward level in order to include local leaders and restore the roles of the village and district heads, the imams and other community leaders and bring everybody on board, to help the security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe have passed the era of the blame game as we must do whatever it takes to return things to normalcy in our communities and give government the opportunity to do what it is supposed to do.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of governance is being seriously challenged. The purpose of government is to protect lives and property and honour and dignity of citizens.\n\n\u201cBut when this purpose is under attack then the entire system is under attack.\n\n\u201cWith technology you can fight wars with minimum number of personnel. So, I hope, the Army authorities will deploy technology so that that we can bring these banditry activists under control.\u201d\n\nThe COAS told the governor that he was on operational visit to the state to interact with the troops in order to know their challenges. The visit was also to seek the continued support of the state government. He commended him for his logistic and equipment support.\n\nYahaya assured that the military would continue to work with other security agencies in the state to ensure relative peace.\n\nHe called on the public to support the army in the discharge of their duties, especially by providing them with necessary information on criminals.\n\nThe COAS had earlier paid a similar visit to the Emir of Katsina, Alhaji Abdulmuminu Kabir-Usman, who also expressed concern over the issue of insecurity in the state.\n\nThe Emir, therefore, appealed to the COAS to take all the necessary measures for Katsina communities to regain their peace and assured him of all the necessary support from the emirate.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Government has again reiterated its commitment to equip the Nigerian Armed Forces to enable it carry out its responsibilities of securing the country from activities of terrorists, bandits, kidnappers and other criminal groups terrorizing the peace of the nation.\n\nThe Federal Government has also promised to ensure the armed forces is well trained and personnel adequately motivated to achieve its statutory mandate.\n\nMinister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi, made this known while commissioning the directing staff quarters of the National Defence College (NDC), at its permanent site Piwowi, Abuja.\n\nMagashi, while commending the armed forces for their resilience, commitment and bravery in keeping the country one.\n\n\u201cAs Minister of Defence, | shall continue to encourage and galvanize efforts towards ensuring that the Armed Forces is sufficiently equipped, well trained and adequately motivated to achieve their statutory mandate.\u201d\n\nHe equally commended the National Defence College for sustaining its achievement as a centre of excellence and promised to ensure the college moves to its permanent site in the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence, under my leadership will continue to support the National Defence College at all times in sustaining its achievements as a Centre of Excellence and attain further enviable heights among other Defence Colleges globally. I also reiterate my full support in fast-tracking the completion of other ongoing projects in the College to ensure its relocation to the permanent site here in Piwoyi within the shortest possible time\u201d.\n\nThe NDC Commandant, Rear Admiral Oladele Daji, said the new edifice would ameliorate the challenge of accommodation faced by the college over the years.\n\nHe said concerted efforts had being made towards the relocation of the college from its current temporary sites in the Central Business District to the permanent site since 2007.\n\nHe said contract for infrastructural development and building construction was awarded in 2007, adding that the projects suffered some delays due to budgetary constraints and inflation.\n\n\u201cThe relocation of the college to the permanent site will ensure that both the faculty and administrative staff operate from a common place thereby ensuring that college activities are well harmonised.\n\n\u201cCurrently, most of the college stuff reside in different locations like Gwarimpa, Apo, Maitama and Ushafa.\n\n\u201cRecently, there has been pressure from the FCT administration for the college to relocate its staff residing at Apo following the sales of the Apo quarters.\n\n\u201cWith the completion of the directing staff quarter1, a sizable number of staff will be relocated from Apo while the remaining will be relocated on completion of the directing staff quarters2 sometime in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commandant disclosed that the college had completed four blocks of building housing its participants and some members of staff while the work on the administrative building was ongoing.\n\nHe thanked President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Defence, for giving the college the needed support to make it a centre of excellence.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties.\u201d\n\nBut when asked if the person could emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential election, he said, \u201cI believe so if we can get him.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on whether or not he still believed in the future of Nigeria, the former military president, said:\n\n\u201cI do believe in the future of Nigeria, but Nigerians don\u2019t believe in the future of their country.

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source TechCrunch\n\nNigerian digital freight company, MVX, has raised a $1.3 million seed round to scale its operations, hire staff, and improve its technology.\n\nWho participated in the round? Kepple Africa Ventures, The Continent Venture Partners, Founders Factory, Launch Africa Ventures, and Oak Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy MVX? Per Techcrunch, Tonye Membere-Otaji, CEO and Founder of MVX, was fascinated by the lack of an online marketplace for vessels while working in the maritime industry in 2016.\n\nHowever, he couldn\u2019t launch because it was challenging to find the right partner and team. But, in 2019, he established MVX with Tobi Amusan (CTO) after raising a $100,000 pre-seed round.\n\nBecause its business model centred around offering a support vessel booking platform that linked vessel chartering requests, MVX was previously referred to as MVXchange.\n\nHowever, this changed in 2020 because of the uncertainty of oil prices and the economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe freight company launched MVXtransit, a digital freight booking platform that helped cargo owners find deals on moving containers. And in April 2021, it launched MVXpay, a finance and payment solution to provide trade finance for freight operators.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? The two products are now rolled into MVX. Also, the startup plans to make freight shipping and trade finance easier for African businesses by bringing booking and deployment processes online.\n\nThe startup claims it has expanded beyond Nigeria and that merchants from the West African country and Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, and Rwanda can use its platform to move freight in and out of their countries.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Ghana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Dignited\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has launched Tingg in Ghana. Tingg is a digital payments network that allows businesses and their customers to accept and make payments easily.\n\nThis announcement is coming after Cellulant was granted a Payment Services Provider (PSP) licence by the Central Bank of Ghana (CBG).\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that Cellulant is now one of the PSPs supported by the Bank of Ghana to provide digital payment solutions throughout the country.\n\nAlso, the PSP licence allows Cellulant to aggregate merchant services and payments for banks, institutions, and the general public, process financial services, acquire merchants, and build PoS systems.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. The licence permits establishing a third-party payment gateway, and a marketplace for fully regulated financial service providers. It also allows merchant acquisition and aggregation, the printing and display of EMV cards, and the limited usage of closed-loop virtual cards.\n\nWhy the licence? The licence is required under the Payment Services Act 2019, which requires any fintech or digital payments company to be licenced by the Bank of Ghana before operating in the nation.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the requirements.\n\nAccording to Cellulant, Tingg helps businesses to digitise their payments using different options.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will enable consumers\u2019 merchants to pay for products and services using regionally appropriate payment options.\n\nRevio raises over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African billing startup, Revio, has raised more than $1 million in a seed round. International venture development firm, The Delta, led the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Brent Maropis (CEO) and Louis Buys (Co-founder), Revio is dedicated to assisting startups, particularly those in the Software as a Service (SaaS) space, get the most out of their billing subscriptions.\n\nAccording to Buys, the company improves client loyalty and makes it easy to avoid unsuccessful payments and customer loss. Essentially, it enables organisations to communicate with customers in real-time through the intelligent use of machine learning and analytics.\n\nRevio claims it supports all currencies and integrates with the African payments startup, Flutterwave, to allow its SaaS clients to sell their products to all African customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Though it\u2019s currently focused on the South African market, Revio plans to expand to East Africa in 2022.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFlutterwave to drive US expansion as it appoints Silicon Valley veteran as head of US growth.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 5, 2021, Nigeria-based digital freight startup, MVX, announced a $1.3 million seed round to tackle the challenge of financing and booking freight operations in Africa. Investors in this round include Kepple Africa Ventures, Launch Africa Ventures, Founders Factory and some angel investors\n\nThis comes after the startup secured a $100,000 pre-seed investment from Oui Capital in 2019.\n\nPer TechCrunch, MVX wants to ease trade finance and freight shipping in Africa by making the process available online.\n\nAccording to Tonye Membere-Otaji, CEO, \u201cWe make it easy and convenient for businesses. We handle everything because we have all these service providers in one platform. So as shippers work with us, MVX works with like seven to ten other service providers.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Membere-Otaji, working at a maritime logistics company, came up with the idea for MVX when he found that there was no online marketplace for vessels. He launched the company with Tobi Amusan, CTO, in 2019 as MVXchange.\n\nAt that point, the company was only a support vehicle booking platform. It connected vessel requests with available Offshore Support Vessels (OSVs).\n\nHowever, the company needed to change its model in 2020 after the oil demand dwindled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Membere-Otaji told TechCrunch that the demand for fossil fuels would reduce over the next few decades.\n\nNow, the company helps businesses to move freight, provides finance and payment solutions for freight operators. This means merchants without adequate capital can request loans to help facilitate freight services. These services are now available on one platform \u2014 MVX.\n\nIn 2021, the company says it has recorded over 300 shipments and plans to reach 1500 before year-end.\n\nTrade Africa still has a long way to go. According to The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD), Africa accounts for only 2.5% and 3% of exports and imports of world merchandise trade value, respectively. MVX hopes to empower trade on the continent offline and online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) raced to the top of the world as the region with the largest volume of peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin transactions, thanks to a major contribution by Nigerians in July.\n\nNigeria is the second-largest P2P market for bitcoin behind the United States \u2013 in July 2021, according to a report by Luno and Arcane Research. This is despite a directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that prohibits financial services to support cryptocurrency businesses and also freeze accounts maintained by exchanges and individuals in the market.\n\nThis is not the first time Nigeria is being put behind the US in the P2P market. Paxful earlier in the year noted that Nigeria was the second-largest market for P2P transactions on its platform.\n\nThe researchers at Luno and Arcane Research explain that Nigerian authorities are unable to censor cryptocurrencies due to the nature of coins like bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult for the government to intervene in these transactions, so they tried making bitcoin less appealing by making the markets less accessible. This caused centralised exchanges to lose ground. Meanwhile, the P2P markets thrived as the remaining option,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThroughout the month of July, the global weekly P2P volumes trailed at around $60 million from $93 million recorded on the week of February 15.\n\nHowever, while the global P2P volumes trend downwards, the SSA P2P volumes have remained stable. Last week saw the P2P trading volumes of SSA become the largest region measured by trading volumes in the P2P markets for the first time, as SSA\u2019s trading volumes surpassed those of Northern America.\n\nRead also: How to buy bitcoin in Nigerian naira safely\n\nNorthern America had seen 181 consecutive weeks as the largest region in terms of P2P trading volumes up until last week when the trading volumes in the region were surpassed by SSA. The last time Northern America was not the dominating region in the market was back in early 2018 when the speculative interest in bitcoin was thriving. Then, Western Europe, Asia, and Eastern Europe saw periods with trading volumes surpassing those of Northern America.\n\n\u201cBack then, speculative mania was leading the volumes to explode. This time around, one could argue that the sustained purchasing demand from the SSA\u2019s is caused by the utility caused by bitcoin\u2019s censorship-resistant nature,\u201d the report notes.\n\nNigeria may be behind the US in terms of volume of P2P bitcoin transactions, but the country is farther down behind the Northern American economic power in putting controls that guarantee protection for investors in the country. While the US has some levels of controls in place and which have encouraged financial service operators to play in the market, the Nigerian central bank chooses to build its own Central Bank Digital Currency and to keep the crypto market far away from financial services.\n\nComments by Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission in which he asked the US Congress to give it more powers to tame the market, rattled the market.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m neutral on the technology, even intrigued\u2014I spent three years teaching it, leaning into it\u2014I\u2019m not neutral about investor protection,\u201d said Gensler, who on Tuesday gave a speech about crypto at the Aspen Security Forum. \u201cIf somebody wants to speculate, that\u2019s their choice, but we have a role as a nation to protect those investors against fraud.\u201d\n\nGensler is hoping that Congress would grant the SEC power to oversee crypto exchanges in the US. The goals, he said, are to protect the investor, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring fair markets.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, disclosed that his government has allocated over 57,000 hectares of land to smallholders and large oil palm plantation investors in four Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state, under the Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP).\n\nObaseki said this while delivering a keynote address at the National Initiative for Sustainable and Climate-Smart Oil Palm Smallholders (NI-SCOPS) Roundtable, held in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor noted: \u201cEdo State Government has allocated over 57,000 hectares of land under the ESOPP programme in four local government areas, which include Orhionmwon, Ovia-North East, Owan-West and Uhunmwonde LGAs. This is the first phase, as we are still looking for more land in the Ovia axis and as soon as this is completed, we will commence the second phase of allocation.\n\n\u201cIn the first phase, we allocated 25 per cent to smallholders while large estate holders were allocated the balance 75 per cent of the total allocation.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cSome of the allottees have taken possession of their land and concluding their community action programme. We believe that by the time all the necessary things have been done, cultivation will commence before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe contributions of smallholder farmers in the oil palm sector cannot be over emphasized, as smallholder farmers account for over 60 percent of crude oil palm produced globally.\u201d\n\nNoting the importance of the oil palm sector to the nation\u2019s economy, the governor further stated: \u201cNigeria is currently Africa\u2019s largest oil palm producers and the 5th in the World, with almost 2.5 million hectares of land under cultivation in Nigeria. However, we still import over N90 billion worth of oil palm produce annually into this country.\n\n\u201cThe low prices of crude oil, which we witnessed this year and the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted our economy significantly and has highlighted the importance and urgency for us to diversify our country\u2019s economy, creating alternative sources of revenue.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian oil palm economy has the capability of earning over $20 billion for our country annually just for cultivation and production. This is why in Edo State, we have taken the bold step of increasing the production of oil palm by supporting investors through the provision of land and a peaceful, secured and business-friendly environment to boost their investment.\n\n\u201cTo effectively and efficiently encourage investors, the state launched the Edo State Oil Palm Programme, in partnership with other private sector stakeholders, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\u201d\n\nHe said under the programme, the CBN committed about N69 billion to support investors who invested in oil palm in Edo State, in line with the federal government\u2019s determination to diversify the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nObaseki added: \u201cEdo State is a member of Tropical Forest Alliance and also African Palm Oil Initiative. The bodies bring together partners from ten oil-producing countries. It is significant to note that Edo State Government is the only sub-national government that is a member of these bodies.\n\n\u201cI encourage all stakeholders to collaborate in achieving a robust oil palm sector in Edo State despite the challenges of the smallholder oil palm farmers, which is also a global issue.\u201d\n\nChris Okafor, representative of IDH noted that \u201cthe IDH-Nigeria value proposition for NI-SCOPS is that by simultaneously addressing multiple factors that impede oil palm landscape development and growth, through a multi-partner and stakeholder processes, a lasting transformation can be achieved in livelihood of smallholders in an environmentally-friendly and socially responsible manner.\u201d\n\n...",

That\u2019s all I can confirm.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen, thank God for the Maradonic way we handled you guys in the society.\u201d\n\nBabangida added that the election \u201ccould have given room for more instability in the country.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was pressured by the military or civilians to annul the election, IBB said: \u201cBoth.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth. The Military, they can do it because they have the weapons to do it. The other is the social agitation.\n\nOn 24 June 1993, Babangida government shocked the world by announcing the annulment of the June 12 election.\n\nAbiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) beat Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention (NRC) in the results declared in the 30 states and Abuja.\n\nAbiola was already known as the winner. What the electoral commission was doing in Abuja was a mere tabulation of the results declared in the states.\n\nThe commission was in the process of completing the ritual when an annulment was announced on radio.\n\nThe statement was not signed by anyone.\n\nWith public outcry, his government attempted to taint the election, by citing unproven allegations of vote-buying and other electoral irregularities.\n\nThe annulment led to protests and political unrest, including the resignation of IBB and the enthronement of a weak interim civilian government.\n\nIt later culminated in a coup by General Sani Abacha eight more years of military rule.",

Following the meeting, former Senate Presidents Bukola Saraki and David Mark were delegated to address the press and the public on the outcome of the meeting.\n\nAddressing the public, Mark explained that a committee made up of major stakeholders including governors, members of the BoT, members of the national assembly, members of the national working committee (NWC), former governors, and former ministers of the party will be constituted and meet within the next 72 hours to address pressing issues.\n\n\u201cWe resolved in the meeting to set up a committee to look at the situation,\u201d Mark said. \u201cThey (committee) will holistically look at the problems within PDP.

The last attack took place on April 27.\n\nOn August 14, 2019, a female suicide bomber killed six people after blowing herself up in western Chad.\n\nThe attack was attributed to Boko Haram jihadists.\n\n\u201cSix people died, including a soldier,\u201d in the attack in Kaiga-Kindjiria district, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nKaiga-Kindjiria lies in Lac province, which abuts the vast Lake Chad \u2014 a region shared by Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria.\n\nBoko Haram launched an insurgency in north-eastern Nigeria a decade ago that has since spilled over into neighbouring countries.\n\nIt has carried out at least 10 cross-border attacks in Chad since 2018, mainly targeting army positions.\n\nIn March, 23 troops were killed when their forward position on the north-eastern side of the lake came under attack.\n\nIn June, 11 soldiers were killed and six were wounded in clashes at Tchoukoutalia, according to the authorities, who said 26 jihadists were killed.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s campaign has left some 27,000 people dead and displaced around two million in Nigeria alone, according to some estimates.\n\nIn 2015, the four Lake Chad countries, together with Benin, set up a combined force to fight Boko Haram with the help of local groups of armed citizens.

          "text": "secession is not the solution to the challenges confronting the country. Kano state governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has urged secession agitators in the country to embrace dialogue as an option in the interest of national unity, adding that\n\nThe Kano State governor also warned that the continent of Africa will lose its respect in the committee of nations in the world if Nigeria ceases to exist as a Nation.\n\nGanduje spoke Thursday in Abuja at the second public lecture series organized by the APC Press Corps with the topic; \u201cSustaining a united and indivisible Nigeria: A myth or reality\u201d.\n\nThe Kano governor said the advocates of secession should have a change of heart and recommended dialogue as a crucial option for addressing their problems.\n\n\u201cThe world will not respect Africa anymore if Nigeria comes to harm and our \u2018Mandela The Great\u2019 won\u2019t sleep well if we blow up this opportunity to lead the black race. That is why we the leaders need to come together to appeal to our aggrieved people who are agitating for self-determination at this time.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Biafran\u2019 agitators and a small section of the Yoruba nation agitating for Oduduwa Republic should therefore always have this at the back of their minds in their political calculations and transformations. It is on record that the great Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first president of Nigeria, was an Igbo man and also a perfect negotiator and foremost champion of Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cThe same for the great Chief Obafemi Awolowo. He never agitated for secession. He was loud and clear on restructuring the federation. And that demand is even louder and the debate is on and no one is troubling agitators for agitating for restructuring of the federation. What is more, the governing party, the APC has a working document already on this (restructuring). This is the way we should all go. There should be no secession distraction at this time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ganduje, there is a National Assembly where some of the grievances can be addressed. Because dialogue is a far better alternative that costs less than the consequences of the wedge that has been erected to frustrate more flow of conversations between the government and citizens to arrive at a national consensus.\n\n\u201cIt is very important at this time that we should use the media for the promotion of peace and stability and change the viewpoints that could alter public views and sentiment toward a more peaceful resolution of our multi-faceted current crises.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Nigeria will remain united. Let\u2019s not entertain any fear. We have become too fused to be divided. Where do you want Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man whose net worth is more than $15.9 billion with his business headquarters in Lagos to go? He is more of a Lagos person than Kano. What of his brother of the BUA Group, Abdussamad Isyaka Rabiu who owns a Nigerian conglomerate active in cement production too? He too is entrenched in the South. Do we see them in Kano as much as we see them in Lagos and the South?\n\n\u201cSimilarly, what do we do with the likes of Rochas Okorocha, former Imo state governor and now Senator representing Imo West Senatorial District in the South East. His investments in northern Nigeria and other parts of the country, providing free education for many years now. So also the Sarki (Oba) Yoruba in Kano, Engr. Murtala Alimi Otisese, a business magnate, an entrepreneur, and a philanthropist. He is from Ibadan in the South West but with flourishing business in the North.\n\nIn his welcome address, chairman APC Press corps, Mr. Jide Orintunsin, said the lecture series was part of APC Press Corps\u2019 contributions towards deepening Nigeria\u2019s thriving democracy.\n\n\u201cThe series is aimed at providing workable template options for effective good governance and to serve as a medium for the deepening of democratic norms and institutions by engaging key players in politics, public administration, academia, and the economy.",

          "text": "As students sit for the Senior School Certificate Examination of the National Examination Council, NECO, nationwide, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Arc. Sonny Echono has expressed dissatisfaction over the poor examination facilities in most Nigerian Schools.\n\nDisclosing this during the monitoring of the conduct of the ongoing internal NECO exams in Abuja Thursday, Echono encouraged schools to not only keep exam halls clean but also make them comfortable places for students to write exams.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, who noted there was a marginal improvement in the lighting and ventilation in the two schools visited, Government Secondary School Garki, Abuja and Federal Government Boys College Apo, Abuja, also observed with dismay that, some examination desks and hall tiles were broken.\n\nAccording to him, molding the children is not only in academics but also in their character and environment.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about places they write exams. I saw marginal improvement in terms of lightening and ventilation of examination hall but still, bot satisfy with the facilities of the exam like a desk, some are broken down even the halls themselves, the broken tiles,\u201d he said.\n\nHe encouraged schools to make sure hygiene and cleanliness are part of the exam arrangements.\n\nStressing the need to embrace technical education, Echono revealed that NECO and NABTEB registration numbers dropped due to economic hardship in the country and the widespread acceptance of WAEC over the two aforementioned.\n\nNigerian Pilot gathered that 1.3million students registered for 2021 SSCE against 1.5 that registered last year.\n\nEchono blamed the state government for being responsible for the low registration, saying that most NECO candidates lack support as states are still owing them, therefore, called for full enforcement to ensure that they are supported.\n\n\u201cEconomic hardship is what parents complain about the number of exams they register for. Parents register for WAEC due to the general belief that WAEC is widely accepted both outside the country than NECO but both of them have the same recognition nationally. But when it comes to kids going abroad WAEC is higher than NECO which explains the decision parents take when they are unable to pay for the two examinations. The same with what NABTEB is suffering from,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the security situation of schools, Echono said the Nigerian government has put all the necessary security measures to ensure that schools are safe.\n\nHe said the report of the Sub Committee on the provision of security for schools will soon be submitted.\n\nEchono also revealed that the government is involving Police and vigilante groups to ensure schools are safe.",

          "text": "Barcelona\u2019s negotiations with Lionel Messi are over and the striker is considering other offers, the club\u2019s president Joan Laporta said on Friday.\n\nLaporta said in a press conference he was not prepared \u201cto put the club at risk\u201d by renewing Messi\u2019s contract, with Barca facing huge financial problems ahead of the start of La Liga.\n\n\u201cYesterday we realised it was over. I had the last conversation with Leo\u2019s father,\u201d said Laporta.\n\n\u201cI do not want to give false hope. The player has other offers and there is a time limit because La Liga starts soon and he needs time to assess his other options.\u201d\n\nMessi reached an agreement with Barcelona to sign a reported five-year contract but with the trade-off that he would earn 50 per cent less per year.\n\nBut La Liga\u2019s financial fair play rules, which are expected to reduce Barca\u2019s salary limit to less than 200 million euros this season, led Laporta to conclude they were unable to complete the deal.\n\n\u201cWe could not accommodate Messi\u2019s contract,\u201d said Laporta, who was re-elected as club president in March.\n\nREAD ALSO: End Of An Era: Barcelona Announce Lionel Messi\u2019s Departure\n\n\u201cThe situation we have inherited is abominable and the sports salary bill represents 110 per cent of the club\u2019s income. We have no margin for salaries.\n\n\u201cLa Liga\u2019s rules set limitations and we have no margin. We knew the situation since we arrived but the numbers we have seen are even worse than we thought.\u201d\n\nBarcelona have total debts of almost 1.2 billion euros, with more than half of that needing to be repaid in the short term.\n\nExpensive signings like Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho, costing around 300 million euros combined, have failed to deliver.\n\nLa Liga announced a deal with American private equity firm CVC earlier this week that agreed to sell 10 per cent of the business for 50 years, in exchange for an immediate injection of 2.7 billion euros. Clubs in Spain\u2019s top two divisions would receive 90 per cent of the funds.\n\nLaporta said Barca could have registered Messi by agreeing to the deal but insisted it was a risk he was not prepared to take.\n\n\u201cWe were not prepared to put the club at risk in this way,\u201d said Laporta. \u201cBar\u00e7a had to be in favour of a contract that would mortgage our television rights for half a century.\n\n\u201cI am not willing to mortgage the club for anyone. We have an institution that is above everyone, even the best player in the world.\u201d\n\nLaporta said he felt \u201csadness and disappointment\u201d but that he \u201cdid everything possible\u201d to keep Messi, who joined Barcelona aged 13 and went on to score 672 goals in 778 appearances for the club.\n\nThe 34-year-old won La Liga 10 times and the Champions League four times. He is also a six-time winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or and is widely considered to be the greatest player of all time.\n\n\u201cThere is a before and after Leo,\u201d Laporta said. \u201cLeo Messi has been an icon and has left some historic moments. We have eternal gratitude to him.\u201d\n\n-AFP",

An investigation is under way.\n\nThe case of Krystina Timanovskaya caught global attention after she refused her team\u2019s orders to fly home.\n\nShe is now in Poland, where she has been granted a humanitarian visa.\n\nThe case has again put the spotlight on Belarus, which has been ruled by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko since 1994. Last year, nationwide protests over his disputed re-election were violently repressed by the security forces.\n\nBelarus says Ms Timanovskaya was removed from the national team because of her emotional state. But the 24-year-old says this is not true, saying she was removed because she spoke on Instagram about the \u201cnegligence of [her] coaches\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, the IOC said it had removed the accreditations of the two coaches \u201cas a provisional measure\u2026 in the interest of the wellbeing of the athletes of the National Olympic Committee of Belarus who are still in Tokyo\u201d.\n\nThe body said a disciplinary commission had been established to investigate the incident and that both coaches would be \u201coffered an opportunity to be heard\u201d.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach said at a press conference on Friday the committee was \u201chappy\u201d Ms Timanovskaya was safely in Poland, and called what happened to her \u201cdeplorable\u201d, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nJapan\u2019s foreign ministry said it was \u201cunjust\u201d and \u201cnot acceptable\u201d that Belarusian authorities had pressured the sprinter to fly home, Reuters reported.\n\nMs Timanovskaya\u2019s removal came after the sprinter complained on social media about being entered into the 4x400m relay race at short notice, after some team-mates were found to be ineligible to compete.\n\nThe video led to criticism in state media, with one television channel saying she lacked team spirit.\n\nMs Timanovskaya said two coaches came into her room and told her to pack her bags immediately, ready to return home. She was told to say that she had been injured.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, she said she was on her way to the airport last week when her grandmother warned her it was not safe to return, after watching local news reports on the situation.\n\nAt the airport, Ms Timanovskaya showed officers a translated plea for help on her phone in an effort to avoid being put on a plane home.\n\nShe was then given police protection before being moved to the Polish embassy in Tokyo. She travelled to Poland on Wednesday.\n\nThe mass protests that gripped Belarus last year saw security forces often use violence to break up the demonstrations and thousands of people arrested.\n\nSome of the protesters were national-level athletes, who were then stripped of funding, cut from national teams and detained.\n\nBut Ms Timanovskaya insists that she is \u201cnot a political girl\u201d and just wants to focus on her sporting career.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about politics. I never was in politics,\u201d she said.\n\nThe sprinter told the BBC she wanted to return to Belarus, but that it was too dangerous at the moment.\n\nHer husband has also fled Belarus and has been given a visa for Poland, but her relatives remain in the country.",
