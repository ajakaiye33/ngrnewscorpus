          "title": "Lekki toll gate: Lagos clarifies legal status over collection of tolls",
          "text": "Lekki-Epe Tollgate\u2026 cause of disagreement\n\n.Describes viral statements as erroneous\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Government has described the statements circulating in the media that it does not have the legal right to collect tolls on the controversial Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge and that tolling on the Link Bridge is unlawful as \u201cerroneous.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo, made the remarks in a statement to debunk the viral statements.\n\nOnigbanjo noted that the misleading statements were based on the false premise that the Lagos State Government has no pending appeal against the judgment of the Federal High Court in Suit No FHC/L/CS/1405/02 between Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa Esq. Vs. Attorney General of The Federation & Ors.\n\nIn the light of the misrepresentation, the commissioner said it has become necessary to state as follows; \u201cOn the 27th day of March 2014, the Federal High Court delivered judgment in Suit No FHC/L/CS/1405/02.\n\n\u201cThereafter on 28th of March, 2014 the Lagos State Government (sued as 3rd and 4th Respondents) filed a Notice of Appeal against the judgment of the Federal High Court and an application for stay of execution and injunction pending appeal.\n\n\u201cThat on 11th of November, 2014 the Lagos State Government filed an application for extension of time within which to compile and transmit the Records of Appeal, at the Court of Appeal\n\n\u201cHowever, on the 9th of October, 2017 owing to lack of representation on the part of Lagos State Government, the application for extension of time to transmit the Records of Appeal, filed on the 11th of November, 2014 was struck out and the Court stated:\u201cSince Applicant is aware of today\u2019s date and is not in court, we take it that applicant is not diligent in prosecuting its application. It is hereby struck out. Number Deleted.\n\n\u201cFrom the foregoing quote what was struck out was the application (that came up before the Court of Appeal on 09/10/17) and not the appeal. There is a distinction between striking out an application and striking out an appeal.\n\n\u201cAs at date, there is no order striking out Lagos State Government\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the Federal High Court delivered on 27th of March, 2014 in Suit No FHC/L/CS/1405/02.\n\n\u201cIt is also notable that before the Federal High Court, the claimant sought ten (10) Declaratory reliefs and one (1) order of injunction[1], to restrain the Lagos State Government from collecting tolls on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge.\n\n\u201cHowever, in its judgment dated the 27th March 2014, the Federal High Court did not specifically or expressly grant either the Declarations or the injunction sought. It rather only held that:\n\n\u201cI agree and uphold that the construction of this bridge was authorized and the 3rd Respondent has the power to generate revenue thereon from the subject matter but the existing law did not cover this bridge and the 3rd Respondent can only make the law to that effect before it can collect toll on the bridge.\n\n\u201cDissatisfied with the lack of clarity and precision in the judgment amongst other grievances the Lagos State Government filed a Notice of Appeal against the judgment on 28th March, 2014.\n\n\u201cThe position of the law is that once a Notice of Appeal is filed along with an application for stay of execution/injunction pending appeal, the judgment being appealed against cannot be enforced until the application for stay of execution/injunction pending appeal has been determined. This position was upheld in VASWANI TRADING COMPANY V. SAVALAKI & CO (1972) N.S.C.C @ 697 \u2013 698, where the Supreme Court of Nigeria held that: \u201c\u2026whilst by virtue of the provision of the section, an appeal or the filing thereof could not eo ipso operate as a stay of execution, clearly, in practice, the position should be different where apart from filing an appeal, the prospective appellant also files an application in this Court, by which a stay of execution of the same judgment is sought. In such circumstances, a general appraisal of the whole situation is absolutely necessary and it is most desirable that the court should ensure that, at that stage of the proceedings, it is not possible for any party to present it with a fait accompli\u2026\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the above position of the law. The Lagos State Government affirms that it will continue to engage with all stakeholders and concerned members of the public in the Lekki axis and will abide by commitments and concessions made at the various stakeholders\u2019 meetings.\u201d\n\nOnigbanjo stressed that based on the foregoing, the statements that the collection of tolls on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge is unlawful and without legal basis or right are clearly incorrect, saying that \u201cthe Lagos State Government\u2019s appeal against the judgment of the Federal High Court subsists and the judgment of the Federal High Court cannot be enforced at this stage.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the following is the annexure 1- claimant\u2019s reliefs in suit \u2013 no FHC/L/1405/02, as made available by Onigbanjo: \u201cA DECLARATION that under the National Inland Waterways Authority Act, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\n\n1999, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and other prevailing statutes, Lagos State Government is entitled to build, erect, construct and maintain a bridge on any federal navigable waterway in Nigeria, in particular, over the Lagos and Lekki Lagoon and to impose, collector demand toll fee, tax or other fees from the Applicant and other citizens of Nigeria, for the use and enjoyment thereof.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that under National Inland Waterways Authority Act, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and other prevailing statutes, Lagos State Government is not conferred with jurisdiction, authority or power of management or control over any federal navigable waterway in Nigeria, in particular, the Lagos and Lekki Lagoon, so as to entitle it to demand, collect or impose any toll fee, road tax or any other fee, from the Applicant and other citizens of Nigeria, for the use and enjoyment of such federal navigable waterway or in respect of any facility built or erected thereon, such as the Lekki Admiralty-Ikoyi Suspension Bridge.\n\n\u201d A DECLARATION that under National Inland Waterways Authority Act, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and other prevailing statutes, the 1st and 2nd Defendants are the ones conferred with jurisdiction, authority or power of management or control over any federal navigable waterway in Nigeria, in particular the Lagos Lagoon, to the exclusion of the Lagos State Government.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the 1st and 2nd Defendants are not entitled to surrender, relinquish, delegate or in any other manner confer their jurisdiction, authority or power over federal navigable waterways, in particular the Lagos and Lekki Lagoon, to the Lagos State Government, for the purpose of demanding, imposing and collecting any toll fee, road tax or any other fee, from the Applicant and other citizens of Nigeria, for the use and enjoyment of such federal navigable waterway.\n\n\u201d A DECLARATION that under the National Inland Waterways Authority Act, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and other prevailing statutes, the Defendants are not entitled to collect toll, tax or fee from the applicant and other citizens of Nigeria when carrying out their statutory responsibility of providing road and other infrastructures for their citizens.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the collection of tolls, tax, fee, money, tariff or any other fee howsoever described, by the defendants, on any road, from the Applicant and other citizens of Nigeria constitutes a contravention of the Applicant\u2019s (and other citizen\u2019s) fundamental right to free movement.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the imposition and collection of road tax, levy, toll fee or tariff from the Applicant and other residents and indigenes of Lekki Scheme 1, Ikoyi, Ajah, Ibeju-Lekki and Epe communities to have access to and use of the Admiralty-Ikoyi Suspension Bridge amounts to discrimination and therefore a flagrant violation of the Applicant\u2019s (and those other residents and indigenes) fundamental rights as enshrined and guaranteed under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is therefore null and void.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the imposition of and collection of road tax, levy, toll fee or tariff from the Applicant, road users and other residents of the Lekki axis by the Defendants is an illegal form of taxation and is inconsistent with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, especially Chapter Four thereof.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the Defendants are duty-bound to provide an alternative route to the Applicant and other citizens of Nigeria before they can commence the imposition and collection of road tax, levy, toll fee or tariff from the Applicant, road users and other citizens of Nigeria in respect of the Lekki-Admiralty-Ikoyi Suspended Bridge.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the imposition of and collection of Five Hundred naira (N500.00) per trip per vehicle, by the Defendants, as road tax, levy, toll fee or tariff from the applicant, road users and other citizens of Nigeria, for an indeterminate period of time, for the use and enjoyment of the Lekki Admiralty-Ikoyi Suspended Bridge is arbitrary, exploitative, oppressive, inhuman and callous, in the circumstances of the economy of Nigeria and is therefore illegal, unconstitutional, null and void.\n\n\u201cINJUNCTION restraining the defendants, whether by themselves, their servants, officers, agents, banks, private or otherwise howsoever, from demanding, collecting, receiving any money, fee, toll, tariff, tax or any such levy from the applicant or any other citizen of Nigeria for the use and enjoyment of any part or portion of the Admiralty-Ikoyi Suspended Bridge.\u201d",

          "text": "Senator Orji Uzor kalu.\n\nHails Clark, Adebanjo, others for standing by S-East\n\nSenate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, on Tuesday, pulled out of the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, urging the South West and South South to support a South East candidate in 2023.\n\nSenator Kalu, in a statement titled \u20182023 Presidency: The Fairness I Know, warned that if power should come to the South and not the South East, the essence for which the six geopolitical zones were created is long dead.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIt is my desire and intention to run for the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I am committed to this pursuit, but I can\u2019t make an official declaration to this regard without the full support of other regions. Everywhere in the world, politics is situational and that of Nigeria is exceptionally situational.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Nigeria is that without the support of other regions, it would amount to a shadow chase for a South Easterner to be President. This is the reason I have been in the frontline of the call that the two major political parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should zone their presidential tickets to the South East as they did for the South West in 1999. In the absence of this zoning, I shall return to the Senate and stay away from the presidential contest. The reality is that the North is more advantageous to win elections in this democratic setting.\n\n\u201cI am even shocked with the number of aspirants coming from the South West and the South South . It is embarrassing that these aspirants (APC and PDP) have no single respect and concern for the South East. I had thought they would think about the South East; I thought they would support us. The amount of money being spent by these aspirants is alarming and they have forgotten that money alone cannot buy the presidency.\n\n\u201cIt has become a joke to an ordinary Nigerian who hears Southern commentators and aspirants rooting for a Southern President on the premise of fairness, equity and justice.\n\n\u201cHow can you talk about these morals when you are not even fair to your own brothers?\n\n\u201cIf there is anything like \u201cfairness\u201d, \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d, it should be the entire South pushing for a president of South East extraction. Anything less than that is \u201chypocritical\u201d, \u201cunjustifiable\u201dand \u201cinordinate\u201d. Some \u2018persons\u2019 are even claiming God\u2019s anointed choice in 2023 .\n\nUnfortunately, it is not all prayers that God answers; at least not inordinate ones.\n\nWhat moral justification does a Southerner who refused to be fair to his brothers have against a Northerner running for president? It will be very insensitive , unreasonable and disrespectful for any Southern man to criticize a presidential aspirant from the North on the ground that the North has done eight years and power should return to the South.\n\nThe South West and the South South have successfully completed their tenures as \u2018President and Vice President\u2019.They should have the courage to support their brothers from the South East. If the next president after President Muhammadu Buhari does not come from the South East , there would be nothing unfair and unjust if he/she comes from Daura\n\n.\n\n\u201cThis country belongs to all of us and the unity of the country should be paramount. If not for selfishness and greed, how can you say that where a president comes from does not matter simply because you don\u2019t want to support a president of Nigeria from the South East, but turn around to clamor for a power shift to the South? How do we explain this to the younger generation? Let the wise and courageous stay firm on their convictions and not swing on the two sides of the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cIf you are convinced that where a president comes from does not matter, let Nigerians not hear you clamour for power shift. Be brave to encourage everyone to run , including President Buhari\u2019s kinsmen. But if you have conscience and believe in equality, then you should support the South East region that is yet to produce a president. That is what I consider as fairness.\n\n\u201cThe two regions that are yet to produce a President are South East and North East. If this means anything to Nigerians, the APC and PDP should be fair enough to prioritize these regions. If power should come to the South and not the South East or North and not the North East, the essence for which the six geopolitical zones were created is long dead .\n\n\u201cTo Pa Ayo Adebanjo, Chief Edwin Clark, Deji Adeyanju and a host of others who have stood firm in their support for their brothers in the South East, posterity will be kind to you.\u201d",

To date, we have communicated through recommendations to the government but no response.\n\n\u201cThis is most disheartening because people in our generation benefited from free education from primary to tertiary level. This is not acceptable, instead of the politicians discussing these issues as a national emergency they are occupied with the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe would be looking at the upcoming political dispensation. A lot of broken promises. No worker should sit down and just watch, certainly that will not be our portion. We must engage politicians, making sure the downtrodden is accommodated in the next political dispensation.\u201d",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday warned Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and a Presidential aspirant to steer clear of the Southeast.\n\nIPOB said Wike denied having any links with the Southeast in the past, hence should keep off the region as he tries to canvas for votes.\n\nEmma Powerful, the spokesman of IPOB, issued the warning while condemning Wike\u2019s recent visit to the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe.\n\nRecalling the killings in Obigbo, Rivers State, IPOB vowed to go all out against anybody who hosts Wike in the Southeast.\n\nIn a statement, Powerful said the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential aspirant should be ashamed of himself for begging Igbos for votes.\n\nPowerful said Wike denied being an Igboman; hence visiting the Southeast may consume him.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe, the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU condemn the recent visit by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State to Obi of Onitsha Igwe Alfred Achebe in Anambra State. The visit is part of the reasons the youths are not happy with Igbo leaders.\n\n\u201cIPOB will not take it lightly on any person who intends to host Nyesom Wike in the hinterland after the genocide he committed in #Obigbo, and he declared that he is not an Igboman. Wike is a genocidist and should not be forgiven. His father took over Igbo property in the name of abandoned property and he trained Wike with the money he accumulated from abandoned property he collected from Igbo people in Igweocha after the war of genocide against the Igbo people in 1970, which moved Wike to hate anything associated with Igbo but he should not come for Igbo vote. We are warning him.\n\n\u201cGov, Nyesom Wike committed genocide against the people in his state claiming he is not Igbo man and today he became an Igbo man because of political interest and votes he needs from Igbo land, Wike refused to understand that a time like this will come in his life. Wike should be ashamed of himself because he could openly beg Igbo people for one vote in the election.\u201d\n\nThe separatist group stressed that Wike\u2019s visit to the Southeast is highly provocative.\n\nIPOB added: \u201cIs Wike coming to urinate on the graves of the Igbo youths he slaughtered in Obigbo during the #EndSARS protests? His visits to any Igbo state is highly provocative because some of the Igbo youths taken into several security cells in the Northern states are yet to return. Wike and his advisers should stop daring IPOB and Igbo youths. Wike\u2019s family, friends and associates should advise him to stay off any state in Igbo land because it may consume him, anybody who knows him should let him know that.\n\n\u201cWe are equally warning any traditional ruler, PG, Chief, elder, Governor or anybody who will invite Wike in any part of Igbo land to tread with caution because that amounts to challenging Igbo youths and IPOB members.\n\n\u201cThose hosting Wike now, where were they when Wike was ordering the killing of Igbo youths at Obigbo? They all maintained criminal silence then. Are they now rewarding him for killing Igbo youths? Love for money has enslaved elders and traditional rulers who should know better but we won\u2019t tolerate that anymore. Wike cannot be going about celebrating in Igbo states which he denied having any links with after ordering the execution of Igbo youths and suspected IPOB members. This is iniquity against the innocent victims of his wicked actions.\n\n\u201cWike said he was not Igbo and we have taken him by his words that he is not Igbo and can never become Igbo man because he hates Igbo with passion.\n\n\u201cWe respect Igwe Achebe because he is a respected traditional ruler in Igbo land but we want him and others to keep a distance from Wike because Wike hates Igbo if they don\u2019t know and if they don\u2019t retrace their steps let the public never blame us.\n\n\u201cThose Wike arrested and handed over to Fulani controlled federal government in Abuja are still there till today languishing in different security detentions. We managed to release more than a thousand (1000) innocent citizens both men and women most of whom were raped at these security detentions and dungeons.\n\n\u201cConsidering all his wickedness to the Igbo youths at Obigbo in Rivers State, we declare that Wike has no moral ground to even contemplate not of the temerity to want to visit any part of Igbo land. He is, therefore, not welcome to any Igbo State. Wike cannot be coming to Igbo land to spit and dance on the graves of those he unjustly slaughtered and we all know that he is a demented fellow.\u201d",

I cherish this award so much.\u201d\n\nThe governor hailed The Sun for its professionalism, nationalism and patriotism, always looking at people by their merit.\n\nGovernor Mohammed said: \u201cFar away from your office in Lagos, you came to Bauchi and picked me as Governor of the Year. I really appreciate this kind gesture. I would be there in Lagos myself to pick the award.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

I promise, we must not let you down.\u201d\n\nMohammed, a former journalist, charged media men to give their best whenever they are called upon to serve, saying: \u201cAs a journalist I always know that I am well prepared for any assignment in life.\n\n\u201cThat is the way to do it.

You have also restored the lost glory of critical sectors of the economy, such as education, health, agriculture and youth empowerment, among others.\n\n\u201cYou inherited the Third National Urban Water Sector Reform Project (NUWSRP3), a World Bank supported project which is expected to resolve the water supply challenges of Bauchi metropolis for the next one decade. The execution of the project had a turning point when you mustered the political will to fast track the pace at which the project was being executed, by approaching the World Bank to review the timeline for the project.\n\n\u201cAgain, to cater to the needs of Bauchi State\u2019s more than seven million people, your administration came up with an ambitious plan for the New Bauchi city.

I have decided that I will run for the office. I have sworn an oath to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is an oath to our people; our children and the future of Nigeria. I owe nobody else any allegiance outside the oath\n\nJames Sowole in Abeokuta and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, took his nationwide consultation tour, in promotion of his presidential ambition, to his home state of Ogun, with a declaration that he swore the oath of allegiance only to Nigeria, and not to any single citizen of the country. Osinbajo was addressing swirling allegations that his decision to run for president was a betrayal of his former principal and erstwhile political godfather, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who had also declared his presidential aspiration ahead of 2023.\n\nThe vice president, who addressed an ecstatic crowd of supporters, said he was not in the state to campaign yet, but to inform his people of his intention to be president. He added that he was one candidate, who would hit the ground running.\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun declared support for Osinbajo, saying the vice president is eminently qualified to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, after seven years of working with him as his deputy.\n\nThe Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, while praying for the vice president at his palace, also attested to the fact that Osinbajo was competent to run. He told Osinbajo, \u201cI want to pray that you will come back to this palace as a president and Nigeria will gain tremendously under your watch.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said he owed no one, aside Nigeria, any allegiance, an apparent reference to Tinubu. The statement draws the line at accusations of disloyalty and betrayal being sold by supporters of the former Lagos State governor.\n\nIn his speech, Osinbajo said he had consulted widely across different sections of the society and leaders, including Buhari, before throwing his hat into the ring.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfter all I have learnt, if called upon to serve the nation, should I say No? I have decided that I will run for the office. I have sworn an oath to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is an oath to our people; our children and the future of Nigeria. I owe nobody else any allegiance outside the oath.\u201d\n\nRecounting his contributions to the administration, Osinbajo said he was actively involved in the judiciary reforms and repositioning of the judicial sector for optimal operation. He noted that working with Buhari had exposed him to governance at the highest level and placed him in a position to tackle serious issues concerning the economy and security, among others.\n\nOsinbao stated, \u201cThe vice president position is an opportunity to serve and I have served with utmost loyalty. I put everything into my work. I am a candidate, who will hit the ground running when I am elected.\n\n\u201cI have the requisite knowledge to do the job and build on what others have put in place. My presidency will bring peace, unity and development to the country.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo commended the Abiodun administration for giant strides it had recorded in the last three years and expressed the hope that his quest to lead the country would be fruitful.\n\nAbiodun said Osinbajo had acquitted himself well, declaring that Ogun would support Osinbajo\u2019s presidential ambition to enable him continue with the laudable projects of the Buhari administration. He said the vice president also stood by him during his governorship battle in 2019. The governor spoke at different stakeholders\u2019 meetings with Osinbajo, held at the Akarigbo Palace, Sagamu, the Alake Palace in Abeokuta, the palace of the Olu of Ilaro, paramount ruler of Yewaland, and the Presidential Lodge, Ibara, Abeokuta.\n\nAbiodun said Osinbajo had in the last seven years contributed to the successes recorded by the federal government, noting, \u201cHe is eminently qualified to lead the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cThe vice president present here is home coming. We are pleased with his decision to run for the office of the president. He is competent and committed to lead the country in a higher capacity.\n\n\u201cYour steadfastness, integrity and character are all well-known. You are serving this country and the president meritoriously for the last seven years as the vice president.

The fourth image depicted another group of 16 men in a sitting position.\n\nRecall that the terrorists had released a video about a week after the attack, showing the moment they were about to release the Managing Director of Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Ali-Hassan to his family.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that the families of the kidnapped victims have also written the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj.-Gen. Mohammed Munguno (rtd), demanding a status report on the state of their loved ones.\n\nIn the letter dated 25 April and jointly signed by Aliyu Mahmood, Idayat Yusuf, Aminu Othman and Dr. Baaba Muhammed on behalf of the victims\u2019 families, they lamented that they had been left in the dark by the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe, the families of victims of the Nigerian Railway Corporation train attack Ak9 departing from Abuja on 28th of March 2022 to Rigasa Kaduna have come together on behalf of the victims that are in captivity.\n\n\u201cWe write to express our concern that there is no representation from government to communicate with us on the status of our loved ones . Even though we know the information may be of confidential nature, but nonetheless, families need to be reassured and be carried along in a safe manner to ensure their release from captivity safely.\n\n\u201cWe humbly request for your facilitation to ensure that the federal government is in touch with the victims families. Thanking you in anticipation,\u201d the letter read.\n\nHowever, the pregnant women among the kidnapped train passengers was quoted by a family source, according to Arise, as having given birth at the weekend.\n\nThe woman who was reportedly eight months pregnant at the time of the attack, gave birth safely after the terrorists were said to have invited the medical personnel to attend to her. The state of health of the baby is however unknown.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports by family sources, she gave birth with the aid of doctors brought in by the terrorists. We can also report that the terrorists are demanding the release of their top commanders in exchange for the abducted train passengers.\n\n\u201cAccording to sources, the terrorists are Kanuri speaking, suggesting that were from the North-east region and backed by the deadly Islamic state group- ISWAP,\u201d the Arise report noted.\n\nBut the report stated that the government was apprehensive that the detainees who have strong ties with Boko Haram, if released, could cause a bigger security threat to the nation.\n\nThe families of the kidnapped victims are expected to hold a press conference today in Abuja and Kaduna to further mount pressure on the government to rescue their loved ones in captivity.\n\nA security expert, Abubakar Ahmed, was quoted as saying that the subliminal message inherent in the release of the pictures, explained that, \u201cThey want to tell the world that the abducted passengers are alive and in good condition.\u201d\n\nA family source added: \u201cWhat kind of country are we living in? There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in the news. Is the government even doing anything about it or terrorism is now part of our norms and culture?\n\n\u201cSonny Okosun\u2019s which way Nigeria was 1984. Almost 40 years later, we are still asking the same question.\u201d\n\nAnother family member of one of the victims, claimed that they had been disturbed since the photos emerged, stressing that: \u201cWe have been praying for him and others day and night.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY further learnt that some of the elderly victims had complained about their deteriorating health conditions.\n\nThe Kaduna State government had recently approved the disbursement of N18 million to families of nine persons killed in the attack, saying it wasn\u2019t compensation but some kind of support.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (KADSEMA), Mr. Muhammed Mukaddas, had explained that the governor had equally approved the disbursement of N250, 000 each to 22 persons severely wounded during the train attack.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Over 40 million Nigerians on microblogging platform\n\nWorld\u2019s richest man, billionaire Elon Musk has reached an agreement to acquire Twitter for approximately $44 billion, the company said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press (AP), Musk, the outspoken Tesla CEO, the world\u2019s wealthiest person, had said he wants to buy Twitter because he thinks it\u2019s not living up to its potential as a platform for \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\nHe said it needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the \u201csocietal imperative\u201d of free speech.\n\nTwitter said it would become a privately held company after the sale is closed.\n\n\u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,\u201d its CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet. \u201cDeeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nMusk describes himself as a \u201cfree-speech absolutist,\u201d although he hasn\u2019t been exactly clear what he means by that. In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he\u2019d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he\u2019d be \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nThe shares of Twitter, which has over 40 million Nigerians on its platform, were up 4.5 per cent in pre-market trading in New York at $51.15.\n\nMusk, a prolific Twitter user, has said it needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech.\n\nThe 50-year-old entrepreneur, who is also CEO of rocket developer SpaceX, has said he wants to combat trolls on Twitter and proposed changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price and banning advertising.\n\nThe billionaire, a vocal advocate of cryptocurrencies, has also suggested adding dogecoin as a payment option on Twitter.\n\nHe had said Twitter\u2019s current leadership team was incapable of getting the company\u2019s stock to his offer price on its own, but stopped short of saying it needs to be replaced.\n\n\u201cThe company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\u201d Musk said in his offer letter last week.\n\nUp to the point Musk disclosed a stake in Twitter in April, the company\u2019s shares had fallen about 10 per cent since Parag Agrawal took over as CEO from founder Jack Dorsey in late November.\n\nThe deal came just four days after Musk unveiled a financing package to back the acquisition. This led Twitter\u2019s board to take his offer more seriously and many shareholders to ask the company not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away, Reuters reported on Sunday. Before Musk revealed the financing package, Twitter\u2019s board was expected to reject the bid, sources had said.\n\nThe sale represented an admission by Twitter that Agrawal was not making enough traction in making the company more profitable, despite being on track to meet ambitious financial goals the company set for 2023. Twitter\u2019s shares were trading higher than Musk\u2019s offer price as recently as November.\n\nMusk unveiled his intention to buy Twitter on April 14, and take it private via a financing package comprised of equity and debt.\n\nWall Street\u2019s biggest lenders, except those advising Twitter, have all committed to provide debt financing.\n\nMusk\u2019s negotiating tactics \u2013 making one offer and sticking with it \u2013 resembles how another billionaire, Warren Buffett, negotiates acquisitions. Musk did not provide any financing details when he first disclosed his offer for Twitter, making the market skeptical about its prospects.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Afenifere, Others Want Tinubu, Osinbajo, Southwest Aspirants to Withdraw from Presidential Race, Say It\u2019s Turn of S\u2019East",
          "text": "\n\n\n\n\u2022Declare Yoruba\u2019s presidential bid inelegant\n\n\u2022Say unfortunate Jonathan allowed himself to be disgraced\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and other major socio political groups in different parts of the country, including Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Middle Belt Forum (MBF), have called on Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu and other South West aspirants to withdraw from the 2023 presidential race, insisting it is the turn of the South East to produce President.\n\nThe call is coming as political parties set for their primaries ahead of the 2023 general election. The call by the prominent socio-political groups reflects the sentiment in the country which increasingly favours the emergence of a president of Igbo extraction.\n\nAfenifere, PANDEF and Middle Belt Forum insisted the South East should produce the president of Nigeria in 2023 for equity, justice and fairness. The groups maintained that if the political class and the retired military generals could concede the presidency to the Yoruba in 1999, the same approach could be adopted to micro-zone power to the Igbo.\n\nThey described the Yoruba presidential ambition as awkward.\n\nThe groups spoke in Abuja at the Greater Nigeria Conference, organised by leaders and friends of the South East Geo-political zone, with the theme, \u201cTogether We Can.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the different groups also condemned what they called a doomed 2023 presidential desire by former President Goodluck Jonathan, saying he would merely be presenting himself for shame.\n\nAfenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, while addressing the conference, said there was need for aspirants from the south, especially, the Igbo, to be united. Adebanjo said the decisions of presidential aspirants, like Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Ameachi, and the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, both from the South-south, to contest would only give the north undue advantage over the south.\n\nStating emphatically that the north did not want to leave power in 2023, Adebanjo explained, \u201cI only like to point to the fact that they are just deceiving you. All that you are hearing that they (the north) are supporting the South-west is an element of deceit to deprive you, to be able to rule you. They don\u2019t like anybody!\n\n\u201cI told Bola (Tinubu) himself, not in the papers, face-to-face, \u2018You believe this man (Buhari) will make you president?\u2019 He said yes. I said, \u2018he wanted to make you president, he asked (Yemi) Osinbajo to contest? He asked (Kayode) Fayemi to contest, he asked Amosun (Ibikunle) to contest? All in the South-west, why? He wanted to divide the Yoruba first.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is that President Goodluck Jonathan allowed himself to be disgraced by mentioning the fact that he was considering whether to be president, for what?\u201d\n\nAdebanjo wondered why political leaders from the north were now propounding a lot of theories, when they realised it was the turn of the Igbo to produce the president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow that it is the turn of the Igbo, they are propounding a new theory: it must be based on merit and all that. If it is the question of merit, if it has been based on merit till today, till Kingdom comes, the Igbo alone will produce the president.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader noted that all the talk about aspirants from the south going to lobby, campaign, and sell themselves was all rigmarole, stressing that the north knows the truth.\n\nAdebanjo advised, \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t like all the people that came out from the east. But for the fact that they are saying you have no people, I\u2019m happy you demonstrated that. But go and unite. A house divided against itself will not stand.\u201d\n\nPANDEF leader, Chief Edwin Clark, also appealed for concession of the presidency to the Igbo in 2023. Clark said Nigeria could not be described as a tripod anymore, because of the country\u2019s current \u201c36 legs\u201d. He said if any part of these \u201c36 legs\u201d got broken, the country would not be at ease, stressing that is what the country is experiencing today.\n\nClark stated, \u201cThe young ones who belong to the disadvantaged legs are fighting and people are pretending not to know why. The other part of this disturbing issue is the question of who has the right over Nigeria? Who is that child, from what part of Nigeria? Who will say no, you cannot destroy our country? You can no longer relegate us to the background.\n\n\u201cWhat right does the antagonist have that the protagonist does not have? What right do you have that the man you are accusing of disturbing you does not have? The reality is that the man, who wants to destroy and the one who is preventing the destruction have equal rights.\n\n\u201cWhy the Igbo should have the presidency is because the children from that geo-political zone are asking whether their own leg is k-legged, or deformed or broken, thus, resulting in the inability of their zone to present the president?\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman noted that if five or more legs out of the 36 legs of the pot were broken, definitely, the pot would be unable to stand. He said during the civil war, one out of the original three legs of the three-legged pot was broken due to the war, and the Igbo, which was the broken leg, had been marginalised in the political equation of Nigeria.\n\nInsisting that the people of the Igbo deserved to have a sense of belonging in Nigeria, Clark stressed, \u201cSo, the clamour for a president for the South-east geo-political zone is supported by me. Today, with no other tangible reason for still wanting to hold on to power, some people are talking about merit and competence. To these people, my response is simple: we must all woo and win each other, because every part of this country has a beautiful bride and every part has a handsome groom.\n\n\u201cIt will not cost money or anything to make Nigeria better. All that is required is for us to demonstrate reciprocal respect, love and understanding to one another. Let us do what is right; let us accommodate one another, and be fair to one another. Let all other Nigerians support a south-eastern candidate for president, come 2023.\n\n\u201cI repeat, very soon, I will be 95 years old. I have spent more than 70 years of this period in Nigerian affairs. I have seen it all. For the peace and sanity of the country, I appeal to all, in the name of the Almighty God, to make this concession to the Igbo, to present a president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDelivering his keynote address, leader of MBF, Dr. Poju Bitrus, said the north should have a rethink of its 2023 presidential ambition, stressing that Nigerians are not fools.\n\nBitrus said it was unfortunate there were people who felt without terrorising the country, they could not continue to rule.\n\nBitrus stated, \u201cIf we look at what is happening in this country now, someone could be surprised why the north, after the monumental failures within this period, will even be contemplating to again want to rule after Buhari. But the unfortunate thing is that everybody thinks if one of theirs is not there, they will be short-changed. How, is the question?\u201d\n\nHe said it would be disingenuous for anyone in 2022 to argue that where the president of Nigeria came from did not matter. If it did not matter, he stated, northern governors and sitting governors would not jeopardise the chances of their own party and give the presidency to the opposition in 2015.\n\nThe MBF leader said it was shocking that the same characters that were groaning in 2014 over zoning in PDP were now arguing that the zone that produced the president did not matter.\n\nBitrus stated that by 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari would have spent eight years as president, adding that it is only fair and equitable that a Nigerian from the southern part of the country occupies the position of president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn the collective wisdom of the departing military and the political class, it was agreed that zoning presidential power to the south-westerner was the most expedient thing to do. At the end of the day, two south-westerners in the persons of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, representing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Chief Olu Falae, representing an alliance of All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) emerged.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 scenario is something similar to what we are having now. The situation we are in now calls for a similar approach by Nigeria. We have to develop a nation; we cannot continue to afford to remain as so many nations within a state. To have a nation we can all call our home, we need justice, equity and fairness.\u201d\n\nThe MBF leader insisted that it would be inelegant for the Yoruba to contest for the position of the president in 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut we believe that it is clumsy and inelegant for the South-west to seek the presidency at this time. Not after Obasanjo\u2019s eight years as president and Osinbajo\u2019s eight years as vice president.\n\n\u201cFor us, the debate should be a straight one between the South-south and the South-east. But the South-south has occupied the seat of president for one term and the South-east has never occupied it at all. The north that presently is occupying the number one position in Nigeria and the South-west that has been served should not entertain any thought of throwing their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cAfter your own region has been served a consensus to stabilise the Nigerian polity and give its people a sense of belonging, it would amount to taking the food tray away in a banquet hall after dishing enough food to one\u2019s plate. Of course, others on the queue will be well within their right to chase and deal with such selfish people.\u201dEven out there in the north, there is a division. The insurgents, the killing, the abduction for ransom have opened people\u2019s eyes to know that all is not well. It is only proper that we take this thing to the south and it is the turn of the South-east to produce the president.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Practically everyone knows of Elon Musk \u2014 the tech entrepreneur who is the world\u2019s richest person. But did you know he likes to tweet while sitting on the toilet?\n\nA prolific user of Twitter, Musk\u2019s most recent passion project has been his $44 billion acquisition of the microblogging platform.\n\nBut he said he\u2019s not buying it to make money but to protect free speech.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d he wrote in a statement to announce the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans.\u201d\n\n50-year-old Musk, who serves as CEO of electric car maker Tesla and spaceflight firm SpaceX, had overtaken Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos to become the world\u2019s top billionaire in 2021.\n\nAccording to Forbes real-time billionaires list, Musk\u2019s net worth stood at $239.2 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe billionaire also has his fingers in just about every pie, with multiple businesses from OpenAI, The Boring Company to Neuralink, while focusing on his long-term goal: colonising Mars to save humanity.\n\nSo, who is Elon Musk \u2014 and how did he get so rich?\n\nTheCable looks into the life of the world\u2019s richest man, who now owns Twitter Inc.\n\nBORN RICH BUT BULLIED AT SCHOOL\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, one of South Africa\u2019s three capital cities. His father was an engineer who was once a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine and his mother a model and dietitian.\n\nHis parents separated in 1980, and around this time, he developed an interest in computer programming. At age 12, he sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he called Blastar to a magazine for $500.\n\nDespite his intellectual prowess and wealthy background, he was bullied throughout his childhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe attended the private, English-speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School \u2014 he started a year early \u2014 and later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School.\n\n\u201cThey got my best friend to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up. And that hurt,\u201d Musk recounted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor some reason, they decided that I was it, and they were going to go after me nonstop. That\u2019s what made growing up difficult. For a number of years, there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the (expletive) out of me, and then I\u2019d come home, and it would just be awful there as well.\u201d\n\nLEFT SOUTH AFRICA TO AVOID MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 17, Musk obtained a Canadian passport (his mother was a citizen) and left South Africa to avoid supporting apartheid through compulsory military service.\n\n\u201cSuppressing Black people just didn\u2019t seem like a really good way to spend time,\u201d Musk said in an interview.\n\nHe attended Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics and economics in 1995.\n\nDROPPED OUT OF PHD PROGRAM AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY\n\nMusk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a PhD in applied physics and materials science at Stanford University. But he dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the internet boom and launch a startup.\n\nSERIAL ENTREPRENEUR\n\nBefore SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla in 2003, Musk founded Zip2 in 1995, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by computer maker Compaq for $307 million.\n\nThe billionaire then co-founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal after a merger with software company Confinity Inc. in 2000.\n\nAIMS TO MAKE HUMANS A MULTI-PLANETARY SPECIES\n\nWith recyclable rockets created by his company SpaceX, Musk hopes to propel humans into space to build settlements on Mars, the Red Planet.\n\nMusk said that he does not want human beings to be limited to just Earth and that humans should be a \u201cmulti-planet species\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s something terrible that happens on Earth, either made by humans or natural, we want to have, like, life insurance for life as a whole,\u201d Musk said during a virtual Mars conference in 2020.\n\nHAS ASPERGER\u2019S SYNDROME\n\nMusk identified himself as having Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\n\nAsperger\u2019s syndrome is a mild form of autism spectrum disorder. People with Asperger\u2019s are often known to have difficulty with social interaction but have normal or above normal intelligence.\n\nIt is estimated that nearly 40 million people are affected by the syndrome.\n\nDIVORCED THRICE, HAS SEVEN KIDS\n\nThe billionaire is thrice-divorced (twice to the same woman). He has seven children.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Twitter has accepted Elon Musk\u2019s offer to purchase the company for roughly $44 billion. The social media platform disclosed in a press release today that Musk purchased the company at $54.20 a share, the same price named in his initial offer on April 14, 2022.\n\nBret Taylor, Twitter\u2019s Independent Board Chair, said in the press release that the board had \u201cconducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\u2019s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nWhen Musk, the world\u2019s richest man with a net worth of $219 billion, made his initial offer, Twitter\u2019s board created a poison pill, a defense tactic used by a target company to prevent or discourage a potential hostile takeover, hinting that it would reject Musk\u2019s offer. News of today\u2019s acceptance shows that the board has changed its stance.\n\nOn April 21, Musk shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that he planned to finance the purchase by securing $25.5 billion of debt and about $21 billion equity commitment.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in the statement announcing the acquisition.\n\nHe also hinted at upcoming changes he might implement at the company, adding that he wants to \u201cmake Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what impact Musk will ultimately have on Twitter, where he\u2019ll start making his proposed changes, or when. He\u2019s recently taken to using the platform to poll users about the creation of an edit button, for example, which Twitter had already been developing at the time. In the initial SEC filing, Musk expressed his plan to take the company private. He also shared during a recent TED interview that he wants to make the Twitter algorithm open-sourced, allowing people around the world to make suggestions and notice changes made to tweets.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s CEO, appeared to support the move, saying in the press release that \u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nReacting to the news, Twitter users didn\u2019t hesitate to jump on the platform to share their predictions, concerns, and of course, hot takes on the matter.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the new owner of Twitter deal with fake accounts, spam bots and authenticating all human beings of this platform. The hacking of democracy using these digital platforms is another huge problem as well as access by subaltern groups and not just elites pic.twitter.com/KzpY4XMd4s \u2014 Pedzisai Ruhanya (@PedzisaiRuhanya) April 25, 2022\n\n#BREAKING African billionaire, Elon Musk, buys US social media network, Twitter, in bid to help the troubled, disease-ravaged, gun-ridden banana-exporting republic which is struggling to recover from deadly ethnic violence following disputed, shambolic 2020 presidential election. \u2014 gathara (@gathara) April 25, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors Note: On Saturday, May 21, 2022, Techpoint Africa is hosting Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, a groundbreaking blockchain summit where industry experts will reveal more about the Web3 ecosystem and where we fit in as individuals. Register here to be a part of the discussion.\n\nThe Web3 buzz is more than just another Twitter trend. With investors betting $27 billion on what can be described as the new iteration of the Internet, it\u2019s a buzz that people should pay close attention to.\n\nOn April 1, 2022, Techpoint Africa hosted a Twitter Space with some Web3 experts to make sense of the Web3 buzz, and in the two hours it lasted, we got a semblance of what to expect in a Web3-powered future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErikan Obotetukudo, Founder and Managing Partner of Web3 Fund, Audacity, kicked off the conversation by explaining the concept of Web3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to her, the Internet has gone from Web1 to Web2, with Web3, the latest iteration. In the Web1 era, the Internet was in its most basic form in the Web1 era, with primarily text-based websites that visitors on which visitors could not give feedback.\n\nThe second era of the Internet ushered in social media and made it possible for anyone to create content and get feedback.\n\n\u201cThe second era brought in Facebook and Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp, which is an area that Africa adopted more quickly. Before that, we didn\u2019t have the Internet infrastructure and the telecoms infrastructure to benefit from this,\u201d Obotetukudo said.\n\nWeb3 is the new Internet generation predominantly focused on blockchain technology as its foundational infrastructure. Rather than dwell on the technicalities of Web3, Obotetukudo believes that the new age of the Internet presents an opportunity for Africans to play a crucial role in the development of new technologies.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, I want to encourage people to get excited about this and build around it because this is the beginning of the floodgates of a new technology that will change the world.\u201d\n\nClement Hugbo, Co-founder of Web3 design agency, Crevatal, added that \u201cWeb3 is an open Internet powered by the blockchain, which allows everyone to be part of creating platforms as opposed to systems where a single or central entity controls online platforms.\u201d\n\nWhat will Facebook look like in the Web3 era?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Web1 looks like\n\nThe Web3 buzz is a combination of other buzzwords Obototukudo said; it\u2019s a mixture of the buzzwords \u2018blockchain\u2019, \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019, \u2018non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\u2019, \u2018decentralised finance (DeFi)\u2019, and \u2018decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\u2019\n\nThese proponents will inform what a Web3-enabled Facebook and Internet will look like. One of Obotetukudo\u2019s examples includes helping Africans get even more value for exported culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe pointed out that her travels from Barcelona to Portugal made her realise that African music and fashion were being enjoyed across European countries. In the Web3 era, African creators can release their works on Facebook, for instance, as an NFT and get even more value.\n\n\u201cIf you were to release a piece of your music as an NFT, anyone worldwide can put some money towards the NFT instead of just liking and commenting on it.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, an artist\u2019s followers or fans can also make profits from appreciating their favourite works as their value increases.\n\nFor Chika Uwazie, Founder of decentralised autonomous organisation, Afropolitan DAO, the Web3 era means full access to the financial ecosystem.\n\nUwazie, who spends most of her time in the US, spoke about some of the issues she has faced with US banks when she is in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either I\u2019m being blocked or unable to use a particular service; it was always one thing after the other. I\u2019m a US citizen, and I was having issues accessing my accounts in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUwazie believes Web3 will disrupt the financial ecosystem, making it easy for people anywhere in the world to access their finances. She also thinks the rapid crypto adoption in Nigeria results from the financial constraints Nigerians experience.\n\nAccording to blockchain data platform, Chainalysis, Nigeria ranked sixth in its 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index. And it\u2019s not just crypto; Nigerians and Africans are embracing more Web3 proponents, creating valuable NFTs from art and music that are being appreciated globally.\n\nHugbo, who corroborated Uwazie\u2019s points, said that Web3 offers access beyond finance. Given the nature of Web3 startups, The peculiarity of Web3 startups is such that people anywhere in the world can work with them, provided they can do the job.\n\n\u201cA DAO makes it possible for anybody to come into the community and showcase their skills. My second job was in a DAO; it was a one-time thing, but I got called back cause I did a great job. From there, people started reaching out to me for more jobs in the Web3 space.\u201d\n\nWeb3: An opportunity for Africans to be leaders in cyber security\n\nSky Mavis, the company behind one of the most successful crypto gaming platforms globally, Axie Infinity, suffered a $625 million hack on March 29, 2022.\n\nObotetukudo believes that such occurrences should encourage Africans to find ways to prevent similar hacks and become the go-to people for cyber security solutions in Web3.\n\nHacking and crypto-related crimes were on the rise in 2021. And according to Chainalysis, illicit crypto addresses received $14 billion, a significant increase from $7.9 billion in 2020.\n\nWhile crypto crime has risen by 76% between 2020 and 2021, it is also important to note that illicit transactions are only 0.15% of the $15.8 trillion transacted in 2021.\n\nFrom getting immediate value for exported culture to participating in one of the biggest technological changes of all time, Web3 is a chance for Africa to play a vital role in the global tech ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nHowever, Hugbo pointed out that while the Web3 buzz opens up many opportunities through decentralisation, we still need to be cautious.\n\n\u201cFor every new technology, there are always phases, from ideation to a complete full technology. Web3 is very much in its early stage, and I don\u2019t think we are fully decentralised yet.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, May 21, 2022, Techpoint Africa is hosting Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, a groundbreaking blockchain summit where industry experts will reveal more about the Web3 ecosystem and where we fit in as individuals. Register here to be a part of the discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

And I have a little historical fact for you.\n\nOn April 27, 1950, the Group Areas Act was passed by South Africa\u2019s Apartheid government.\n\nWhat was the purpose of the Act? The Act mandated racial segregation in South Africa\u2019s urban areas. It also limited land ownership and occupation to a specific legal group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Blacks in South Africa were not allowed to own or occupy land in White areas. While the law was supposed to apply in the opposite direction, it was Black-owned land that the government appropriated for White-only use.\n\nSomething you should know about Apartheid: As a system, apartheid was obsessed with racial segregation of South African citizens. This was done to promote White superiority and solidify the minority White regime at the expense of the Black majority.\n\nNow that you have an idea of what happened today in history, kindly take a look at what I\u2019ll be discussing today:\n\nJustin Irabor\u2019s transition into tech\n\nAirtel\u2019s licence to operate as a super agent\n\nEthiopia\u2019s plan to allow foreign mobile money service\n\nFarmerline wants to improve agricultural infrastructure\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nJustin Irabor\u2019s transition into tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\n\u201cJack of all trades, master of none\u2026\u201d has come to be regarded as an insult over the years. Perhaps because we don\u2019t get to hear the complete saying, or because we believe it\u2019s beneficial to be an expert at only one thing.\n\nOn the other hand, It\u2019s not so bad if you\u2019re only good at one thing. I, for example, am not particularly gifted or interested in a variety of areas. \ud83d\ude06\n\nNotwithstanding, I admire people who have various interests and are, to some extent, good at what they do. For example, I know Oluwanifemi, our Senior Reporter, can cook (not as a survival skill, but as an interest), sew, write, and probably do other things I\u2019m not aware of. That, to me, is impressive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a side note, do you know anyone who believes in the complete saying, \u201ca jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one\u201d?\n\nWell, I\u2019d like you to meet someone who doesn\u2019t just believe in the saying but has demonstrated over the years that being exceptional at one thing is not enough.\n\nAlso known as Mogwai or TheVunderkind, his government name is Justin Irabor. He is an artist and illustrator who creates comics, talks about comics, shows (most recently, Archer), NFT, Metaverse, Web3, and sings.\n\nInterestingly, on a good day, he sends between 50 and 80 tweets. From one-liner quoted retweets to full-fledged tweet threads to images with ALT text, there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\nHe works as a software engineer, but was previously an editor-in-chief and a digital marketer. Anyone who can tell me the link between all of this, 20 marks. Show working, please.\n\nSidebar: If you\u2019re thinking of transitioning into tech and don\u2019t know how to start, I think you should read this to the end.\n\nAlso, he was also unemployed at one point. \ud83d\ude06 Don\u2019t think he had it all rosy. I believe you can draw inspiration and learn from his story. Kindly take a moment and read it here: How a search for infinite learning led Justin Irabor to the world of computer science\n\nAirtel\u2019s licence to operate as a super agent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel Africa Plc announced yesterday, Tuesday, April 26, 2022, that its subsidiary, Airtel Mobile Commerce Nigeria Ltd, has received a licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to operate as a super agent.\n\nThis means that Airtel Mobile Commerce Nigeria has received final CBN approval to conduct certain banking activities like financial services within communities. This is aimed at strengthening financial inclusion by expanding financial services to the unbanked and underbanked across the country.\n\nRemember that the company received an approval-in-principle \u2014 a temporary approval contingent on meeting specific requirements \u2014 in November 2021.\n\nAirtel believes that the licence will enable the company to establish an agency network to service the customers of licenced Nigerian banks, Payment Service Banks, and Mobile Money Operators in the country.\n\nIs this similar? Yes! Recently, MTN received final PSB approval to kick-start an exciting era for Nigerian fintech. Click on the link to find out more about that.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s plan to allow foreign mobile money services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining licences today, albeit a different type.\n\nHow is it different? The Central Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) proposed a bill to allow foreign investors to provide mobile money services in Ethiopia. This bill, if approved, will help firms like Safaricom, Kenya\u2019s telco company, to operate in the country.\n\nThis implies that Ethiopia has started the process of changing its national payment law. Consequently, Safaricom will be able to launch its mobile money service, M-Pesa, in the country.\n\nRecall that in 2018, Safaricom was reportedly in advanced talks with Ethiopian government officials to expand into Ethiopia.\n\nAnd in 2021, Ethiopia cleared the way for Safaricom to introduce its popular M-Pesa to the 110 million people in the Ethiopian market after the country\u2019s decision to include mobile phone-based financial services in the telco\u2019s licence.\n\nDon\u2019t forget: A consortium led by Safaricom obtained the first private mobile telecommunications licence but lacks a permit for mobile financial services like M-Pesa.\n\nWhy? For decades, Ethiopia\u2019s telecoms market was closed to foreign investors. To change that, the NBE is attempting to remove the final legal hurdle for Safaricom through the Bill, which was made public last week.\n\nRemember that Ethio Telecom, the state monopoly, attracted four million users within weeks of launching a new mobile financial service called Telebirr in May last year. This demonstrates the market\u2019s potential.\n\nPer the NBE, over 75% of Ethiopia\u2019s population is unbanked, so, I think M-Pesa should thrive because it has only one competitor, Telebirr. But do you think it will succeed? What are your thoughts?\n\nFarmerline wants to improve agricultural infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarmerline, a Ghanaian agritech startup, has raised a pre-Series A round of $12.9 million \u2013 $6.4 million in equity and $6.5 million in debt.\n\nThe equity round was led by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund (ARAF) and FMO, the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank, with participation from Greater Impact Foundation.\n\nDEG, Rabobank, Ceniarth, Rippleworks, the Mulago Foundation, the Whole Planet Foundation, the Netri Foundation, and Kiva were among the debt lenders.\n\nWhat does the startup do? The startup says it improves farmers\u2019 access to high-quality production inputs and education on best farming practices, including how to cope with the effects of climate change. Its solutions are also intended to help farmers gain faster access to markets, resulting in higher earnings and less post-harvest loss and waste.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Alloysius Attah and Emmanuel Owusu Addai, Farmline aims to reach 300,000 farmers by 2022, representing a 400% increase in growth over the previous year.\n\nThe funding will be used to improve their infrastructure, including warehouses and distribution channels.\n\nWhat does this mean? According to Attah, \u201cHaving a network of partners that can help us quickly move inputs like fertiliser and seeds to rural areas, and farm produce from rural areas, is important and part of what we do. We don\u2019t intend to bring all of the logistics and storage in-house, but we want to be more efficient and that means working with the right partners.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it will begin operations in Ghana before moving on to Ivory Coast.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies hire smart people to help improve how their customers perceive and interact with their products, and Justin Irabor is one of such people. One interesting thing about him is that he has provided value through various channels over the years. If Justin Irabor doesn\u2019t ring a bell, his aliases, Mogwai and TheVunderkind, should.\n\n\u201cI have been many things. It depends on the timeframe I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he begins.\n\nJustin has consistently demonstrated his belief that being exceptional at one thing is not good enough.\n\nIn one of his Substack blog posts, he quoted science fiction author, Robert A Heinlein\u2019s infamous words, \u201cSpecialization is for insects,\u201d not really in praise of self-sufficiency, but rather in the context of mastering one\u2019s craft. Ironically, you would have to move on to the next when that is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin is driven by the philosophy of not being ruled by a scarcity mindset, and it appears that once he has \u201cslain his dragons,\u201d as he puts it, in a particular field, he\u2019s ready for a new exploit.\n\n\u201cLet things go if they are inconvenient for you, more things will come!\u201d\n\nFlipping the pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin describes his career start as \u201ca classical spreadsheet monkey,\u201d working on an eCommerce product as a content executive. Between 2015 and 2021, he was editor-in-chief at a PR company, regional marketing manager for Jumia Food, and head of content and marketing at Hotels.ng.\n\nHe also tried his hands out as the product manager and editor-in-chief for Big Cabal and Zikoko. Later, he took up the opportunity to set up the digital marketing department for Eden Life.\n\nMogwai\u2019s past roles constantly saw him draw upon his superb ability to write convincingly and analyse outcomes and predictions \u2014 skills needed by a marketer and growth specialist. While in these positions, he built confidence and slowly transitioned from the shy person he once was.\n\nIn the past seven years, in contrast to the number of times Justin has granted interviews, he prefers instead to publicise his thoughts through texts and illustrations on different platforms, some of which I was able to track: two Substack blogs \u2014 do while thinking and Craft overflow \u2014 a very active Twitter account, a GitHub repository, a website, and a LinkedIn account.\n\nFun fact: Justin sends between 50 and 80 tweets on a good day. From one-liner quoted retweets to full-blown tweet threads to images with ALT text. If he isn\u2019t talking comics, it\u2019s a show (recently animated series, Archer), NFT, Metaverse, Web3, or songs.\n\nJustin is also an artist and illustrator who makes comics to pass the time. Despite all that he does, Mogwai does not let his works alone speak for themselves; he consistently shares his journey. That I got interested in his story is proof that this strategy works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarketing, for him, means convincing people and not spending a lot of money while at it.\n\nJustin\u2019s somewhat ironic background saw him having to speak to people despite how shy he was. As a young boy, he gained some sales experience and has grown to work as a digital marketer, content creator, and growth expert.\n\nSpeaking about his experience transitioning across companies and industries, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful; it\u2019s very distressful even. Half the time, you\u2019re gonna be thinking, \u2018Ah! I made a mistake. I should just stay with the thing I\u2019m comfortable in.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nHowever, despite the challenges and doubts about new ventures, he finds that he is fulfilled at the end of the day.\n\nTransitioning to software engineering\n\nLet\u2019s begin with an excerpt from Justin\u2019s LinkedIn bio \u2014 \u201cI come from a background in digital marketing and growth, and that instinct makes me a software engineer who builds products with considerations for the end-user by default.\u201d\n\nI should probably reveal that his transition from digital marketing to software engineering was why I decided to meet Justin.\n\nWe meet at his place. He sits across from me, a table between us, in a sitting room with several strategically placed framed works of art belonging to his flatmate. Donning a pair of grey joggers with a matching T-shirt, he greets me with a warm smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a conversation with Justin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nSoftware engineering called out to him when he was editor-in-chief at a startup, and every downtime had to be escalated to the technical team.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t act on this pull until 2019, when it was clear he needed to change direction. Two years earlier, he thought it was impractical for him to do it along with his job, but he did it nonetheless while still at Eden Life.\n\nA little back story here. By the time Justin had spent four years in marketing and growth, he knew it was time for a change. He was not entirely excited by where his career trajectory might take him \u2014 probably peaking at a C-level executive role and being responsible for a global company\u2019s continental growth.\n\n\u201cMoney is good, but it doesn\u2019t excite me; I am driven by a purely intellectual pursuit. This means that beyond a point, I began to feel like, \u2018Oh! d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! I\u2019ve done all of these before.\u2019 Everything is the same thing but in a different context. It\u2019s like, when you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. The only thing I could do was start to switch industries.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something that felt like when you get on a treadmill; you can\u2019t get off. Once you\u2019re a software engineer, and specifically, computer scientist \u2014 that\u2019s what I wanna be \u2014 your learning is infinite,\u201d he lets out an excited laugh with a lit-up face, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna know some things, but you ain\u2019t gonna know everything till you die.\u201d\n\nI recognise this demeanour anywhere; it could only mean that Mogwai had hit gold and found the perfect escape in software engineering.\n\nIn 2019, Lambda School, a California-based online coding school, opened its doors to students from Africa, and Justin was part of the cohort in that pilot phase. The full-stack developer education programme did not strain his finances since it was a school-now-pay-later arrangement. However, the challenging part was the commitment it required.\n\nJustin describes his daily regimen.\n\n\u201cFor 11 months at a go, every single day, I was writing code. Every single day, I was building a project. This was how I worked it. I attended classes from 8 to 10 a.m. before going to work at Eden till evening.\u201d\n\nOne of the most significant sacrifices he made was putting in extra hours at work to make up for time lost in the mornings. He\u2019d get home in the evenings and take a nap before waking up at 10 p.m. to work on meeting his learning expectation \u2014 to build products after every class.\n\nThe sacrifices paid off, and he\u2019s worked for two foreign companies in under two years.\n\n\u201cI graduated, and I got a job working for a designing agency in the UK called Series Eight. Did a few months there, and then I got a job at a fintech company in Belgrade, Serbia. I\u2019m a full-stack engineer there. So, I work on the backend APIs and customer-facing administrative data board.\u201d\n\nA year as a software engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nAlthough Justin was sure about transitioning into software engineering, he didn\u2019t escape the frustration that came with the move.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I finished Lambda School, it was difficult to get a job as a software engineer.\u201d\n\nHe speaks about a period when he did not have a job. It lasted much longer than he thought and gradually depleted his savings. It took a lot of self-restraint not to pick up a marketing role or accept an offer from a Nigerian company \u2014 which he had initially decided against for some reasons.\n\nBut, in the face of challenges, he spurred himself on by repeatedly asking, \u201cHow badly do I want it?\u201d\n\nHis current job is at TradeCore, a fintech API company, where he\u2019s the only full-stack engineer on the team. He considers his craft as something very intellectually satisfying.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m building, I\u2019m nourished by the things I learn.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the appeal he gets from computer science is how difficult it can get sometimes.\n\nHe takes his time simplifying what programming is to me, but I can\u2019t deny it will take more convincing to agree that it is not more complex than he\u2019s making it. He can probably guess that from my look but still encourages me to try it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but it\u2019s not as difficult as people tend to think because you only have to understand the context. Programming is the purest expression of creativity which means if you\u2019re a creative, you should want to be a programmer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Justin\u2019s new obsession is all over his public-facing platforms.\n\n\u201cAnd lately, I have interest in Web3. So, I do a bunch of Web3 projects; I work on a bunch of DAOs, and I do some dev relations for Web3 products.\u201d\n\nJustin carries himself with the air of a seasoned software engineer, and you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking he has been in the space for longer. He attributes this to many things he picked up while working in marketing. It is safe to say that he\u2019s proud of his growth.\n\n\u201cI manage myself. I come into meetings and ask questions like I\u2019m a senior engineer. I take responsibility. I learnt that working in the hospitality space.\u201d\n\nMaking Justin proud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nJustin takes pride in being a voracious learner choosing to expose himself \u201cto the trauma of ignorance every day.\u201d Once he discovers a problem, he finds a fix by getting books and tutorials.\n\nAnother smart move is documenting his journey to get a graph of his progress.\n\n\u201cI have something called \u2018Thinkboy\u2019, a note archive which is only for software engineering stuff. I create a folder for the month. I\u2019ve archived the one for 2021.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s committed to building apps even if they don\u2019t get deployed.\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of how an average day looks for him. He wakes up at 9:05 a.m., has a stand-up meeting at 10 a.m. to share progress on the previous day\u2019s tasks, and plans for the day. He typically spends the rest of the day on peer programming, debugging, responding to emails, writing code, and making deployments.\n\nHaving recorded a few high and low points, Justin considers Angels Among Us \u2014 a project he worked on during the lockdown in 2020 \u2014 as his proudest achievement. Angels Among Us was deployed a month before he graduated from Lambda School. He describes it as an app for people with relatively secure financial statuses to help a randomly-generated list of people who have been economically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nIn a short time, it attracted several donations and volunteers to put smiles on the faces of several families after raising around \u20a64 million (~$10,000). And, of course, it was only a matter of time before it got the attention of international press platforms like Quartz and Reuters.\n\nDespite the stress that came with it, Justin accomplished his goal of making something purely altruistic. And he plans to do more of such.\n\nAlthough he can\u2019t put a number to the projects he\u2019s built, his most recent is Catalogue, a free NFT minting tool for people with no basic NFT knowledge. He also built Astrofy, an app that generates a horoscope-based Spotify playlist. There are also close to ten other software projects, one of which was runner-up at the BuyCoin fintech Hackathon.\n\nIf things go according to Justin\u2019s plans, he will build a startup in the next three to five years. But if that does not happen, he has the vision to improve on Angels Among Us and create a verifiable database of people who need help across Africa.\n\nIf it does take off, it will create a consistent help channel for people who need it. Say, an amount dedicated to a child\u2019s schooling annually. For him, this would have a long-term impact and cause a dent in the continent\u2019s institutional poverty.\n\nIf Justin is not working, he\u2019s illustrating. In a different life, he would be a filmmaker. If Justin could speak to the whole world at once, he\u2019d say, \u201cYou should be more willing to interrogate established wisdom.\u201d\n\nFun fact: There\u2019s a story for one of Justin\u2019s aliases, Mogwai. A quick Google search tells you it means \u201cevil spirit\u201d or \u201cdevil\u201d in Cantonese. Weird, yes? But Justin says his choice of Mogwai is to remind him to always take responsibility if he wants the best results. Side note: Mogwai used to be a cute pet.

The event, organized by Volition Cap in partnership with the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, was designed to showcase Dubai as a destination for global expansion and alternative funding for the continent\u2019s many innovative entrepreneurs and companies.\n\n\u201cDubai continues to introduce initiatives that enable confidence, resilience and agility that have been instrumental in the city\u2019s emergence as a hotbed for talent, investment and market creation. The city\u2019s robust public private partnership policy and appetite for innovation, coupled with world class infrastructure, financial ecosystem and pro-business legislation are designed to empower new models of working and allow for rapid scale up, new market expansion and dual listing opportunities for accelerated company growth from Dubai for African entrepreneurs\u201d, said His Excellency Helal Saeed Almarri, Director General, Dubai\u2019s Department of Economy and Tourism.\n\n\u201cThe number of African companies has grown in Dubai more than 15% since 2019, with close to 25,000 based here and we continue to see enhanced bilateral growth opportunities continue to develop.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHE Helal Saeed Almarri \u2013 Director General DET\n\nThe event featured a series of discussions and meetings with leaders of the city\u2019s business and innovation ecosystem; offering visiting Founders unique insight on current and future outlook as Dubai continues to build on its status as a global centre of trade and commerce. The itinerary included visits to the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial centre in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA) region; Dubai Future Foundation and the newly launched Museum of the Future, as well as the Dubai Financial Market (DFM). Africa Founders Immersion Dubai event also provided a platform for African Founders to interact with the funding and investment community in the city.\n\nAt Expo 2020 Dubai participants attended a deep dive session with the team behind District 2020, a smart and sustainable mixed-use community built with human centricity at its core and focused squarely on curating a global innovation ecosystem across key growth areas such as smart logistics, smart mobility, digital healthcare and smart cities; as well as other industries that are set to grow in a post-COVID world. District 2020 will boost an integrated community of Fortune 500 companies, start-ups, scale-ups, accelerators, universities, and government entities to enable cross-industry collaboration, learning and development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIyin Aboyeji speaking during a panel session at the Volition Cap African Founders Immersion Event in Dubai\n\nTotal funding secured by start-ups in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) more than doubled to reach approximately US $864 million in the first quarter of the year, according to a report from data platform Magnitt, total. Start-ups in the UAE accounted for 27.3 per cent of all deals closed and 34.4 per cent of all funding raised year to date in MENA in 2022.\n\nSpeaking further on the vision of Volition Cap and its future plans for the Africa Founders Immersion Dubai, Kola Oyeneyin, Co-founder at Volition Cap said, \u201cThe African tech ecosystem can only truly scale as more capital is unlocked. Founders should be able to choose which fund or cheque will ultimately open up more markets to them as they begin to scale. This is what makes this ecosystem collaboration very important and we look forward to welcoming more founders and investors from across the continent to explore and unlock new opportunities for scale and funding.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of Founders at the Volition Cap African Founders Event in Dubai\n\nAbout Dubai\u2019s Department of Economy and Tourism (DET)\n\nWith the ultimate vision of making Dubai the world\u2019s leading commercial centre, investment hub and tourism destination, Dubai\u2019s Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) is mandated to support the Government in positioning the emirate as a major hub for global economy and tourism, and in boosting the city\u2019s economic and tourism competitiveness indicators.

          "title": "eNaira adoption: The journey after seven months",
          "text": "Joseph Raji successfully registered and created his eNaira wallet late last year but several attempts to use the digital currency have proved abortive.\n\nHe is yet to do any transaction because the naira in his bank account is not converting to the eNaira wallet.\n\n\u201cI used my bank app to convert the naira in my account to eNaira and it was debited but reversed,\u201d Raji said. \u201cThe eNaira never arrived in my working eNaira speed wallet.\u201d\n\neNaira, Nigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), has not lived up to the expectations of many users like Raji, almost seven months after it was launched, BusinessDay has learnt.\n\nAccording to sources, Nigerian banks have not been raising awareness of the digital currency since October 2021 due to alleged hitches that marred the usability of the app.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s visit to some banks to inquire about the eNaira confirmed that the app had been dormant.\n\nIn one of the Tier 1 banks, a staff member said they were holding an online meeting where the eNaira was the main topic. According to her, the use of eNaira began on April 26, 2022, after months of being dormant.\n\nWhen asked about the transaction process, she said for users to load money to their wallet, they have to have a bank app where the bank will send money from the app to the eNaira wallet. She said to receive money to the eNaira wallet, users use the individual barcode or merchant code. Each wallet has a merchant code used for transactions.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) considers commercial banks as a critical vehicle to increasing the adoption of the eNaira. Reports had projected that the CBN, which insisted on 100 percent control of the eNaira, will simply plug into the network of consumers already built by banks to deploy the eNaira, thereby achieving ubiquity within a short time of launch. But it seems that has not been the case.\n\nIn January 2022, a report put the total number of downloads of the eNaira at 694,000 after 95 days of launch. Total downloads via iPhone Operating System stood at 136,000, while that of Android was 558,000.\n\nIn April, Miriam Olusanya, managing director of GTBank, said downloads on the eNaira had grown to 756,000. In terms of consumer wallets, the eNaira has seen 165,000 consumer wallets and 2800 merchant wallets.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was they wanted to release it in October and they brought it out for a test, but they were not able to get through with it; so they dropped it. They have not said anything to us since then,\u201d said a product manager in one of the banks.\n\nOsita Nwanisobi, director of the corporate communications department at CBN, told BusinessDay that the apex bank did not ask the banks to suspend deployment of the CBDC. \u201cThe eNaira was also a major subject discussed by managing directors of commercial banks during the Bankers\u2019 committee meeting on April 14.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can the CEOs brief the press on the eNaira issue and what they\u2019re doing to deepen the process and someone comes out a few days later to say it was suspended?\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral bank customers told BusinessDay that the last time communication on the eNaira was sent to them was in November, about a week after it was released. The few who attempted to register on the app said they were turned off by the repeated hitches they experienced.\n\n\u201cDue to a surge in downloads on the day it was released, the platform started having problems. The CBN officials kept telling us they will work on it. At some point, they started saying we should wait until they get back to us. That is why banks stopped sending emails to their customers about the eNaira,\u201d said another product official in one of the banks.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that the eNaira app was last updated on November 3, 2021, about 10 days after the release of the app on October 22.\n\nSeveral attempts to register on the eNaira app failed as it was unable to recognise valid account numbers from the banks.\n\nAccording to an expert, the app\u2019s inability to authenticate account numbers from banks would mean the API is not in use.\n\nAndrew Nevin, chief economist at PwC, told BusinessDay that eNaira is a journey.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, in a few years, it will be a major way to conduct low value transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe eNaira came with a lot of promises, one of which was to put the country on the global map of the countries in the world with CBDC in use. Retail CBDC projects around the world were led by eNaira and the Bahamas Sand Dollar, which was issued as a legal tender in 2020, making the Bahamas the first country to launch a CBDC, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April.\n\nBahamas, the first country in the world to launch a commercial CBDC called Sand Dollar, handed it over to a fintech company Island Pay, which it created to run the CBDC.\n\nThe CBN had in October 2021 announced the launch of the eNaira, arguably the first of its kind in Africa.

          "text": "Joseph Raji successfully registered and created his eNaira wallet late last year but several attempts to use the digital currency have proved abortive.\n\nHe is yet to do any transaction because the naira in his bank account is not converting to the eNaira wallet.\n\n\u201cI used my bank app to convert the naira in my account to eNaira and it was debited but reversed,\u201d Raji said. \u201cThe eNaira never arrived in my working eNaira speed wallet.\u201d\n\neNaira, Nigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), has not lived up to the expectations of many users like Raji, almost seven months after it was launched, BusinessDay has learnt.\n\nAccording to sources, Nigerian banks have not been raising awareness of the digital currency since October 2021 due to alleged hitches that marred the usability of the app.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s visit to some banks to inquire about the eNaira confirmed that the app had been dormant.\n\nIn one of the Tier 1 banks, a staff member said they were holding an online meeting where the eNaira was the main topic. According to her, the use of eNaira began on April 26, 2022, after months of being dormant.\n\nWhen asked about the transaction process, she said for users to load money to their wallet, they have to have a bank app where the bank will send money from the app to the eNaira wallet. She said to receive money to the eNaira wallet, users use the individual barcode or merchant code. Each wallet has a merchant code used for transactions.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) considers commercial banks as a critical vehicle to increasing the adoption of the eNaira. Reports had projected that the CBN, which insisted on 100 percent control of the eNaira, will simply plug into the network of consumers already built by banks to deploy the eNaira, thereby achieving ubiquity within a short time of launch. But it seems that has not been the case.\n\nIn January 2022, a report put the total number of downloads of the eNaira at 694,000 after 95 days of launch. Total downloads via iPhone Operating System stood at 136,000, while that of Android was 558,000.\n\nIn April, Miriam Olusanya, managing director of GTBank, said downloads on the eNaira had grown to 756,000. In terms of consumer wallets, the eNaira has seen 165,000 consumer wallets and 2800 merchant wallets.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was they wanted to release it in October and they brought it out for a test, but they were not able to get through with it; so they dropped it. They have not said anything to us since then,\u201d said a product manager in one of the banks.\n\nOsita Nwanisobi, director of the corporate communications department at CBN, told BusinessDay that the apex bank did not ask the banks to suspend deployment of the CBDC. \u201cThe eNaira was also a major subject discussed by managing directors of commercial banks during the Bankers\u2019 committee meeting on April 14.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can the CEOs brief the press on the eNaira issue and what they\u2019re doing to deepen the process and someone comes out a few days later to say it was suspended?\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral bank customers told BusinessDay that the last time communication on the eNaira was sent to them was in November, about a week after it was released. The few who attempted to register on the app said they were turned off by the repeated hitches they experienced.\n\n\u201cDue to a surge in downloads on the day it was released, the platform started having problems. The CBN officials kept telling us they will work on it. At some point, they started saying we should wait until they get back to us. That is why banks stopped sending emails to their customers about the eNaira,\u201d said another product official in one of the banks.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that the eNaira app was last updated on November 3, 2021, about 10 days after the release of the app on October 22.\n\nSeveral attempts to register on the eNaira app failed as it was unable to recognise valid account numbers from the banks.\n\nAccording to an expert, the app\u2019s inability to authenticate account numbers from banks would mean the API is not in use.\n\nAndrew Nevin, chief economist at PwC, told BusinessDay that eNaira is a journey.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, in a few years, it will be a major way to conduct low value transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe eNaira came with a lot of promises, one of which was to put the country on the global map of the countries in the world with CBDC in use. Retail CBDC projects around the world were led by eNaira and the Bahamas Sand Dollar, which was issued as a legal tender in 2020, making the Bahamas the first country to launch a CBDC, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April.\n\nBahamas, the first country in the world to launch a commercial CBDC called Sand Dollar, handed it over to a fintech company Island Pay, which it created to run the CBDC.\n\nThe CBN had in October 2021 announced the launch of the eNaira, arguably the first of its kind in Africa. In a statement, the apex bank said the launch of the eNaira was a culmination of several years of research work in advancing the boundaries of the payments system in order to make financial transactions easier and seamless for every strata of the society.\n\nApart from the ease of payments, the eNaira is supposed to tackle challenges with cross-border payments by giving Nigeria the ability to transact separately, thereby reducing the demand for correspondent banking services and SWIFT international financial messaging and payment systems for the clearing and settlement of the trade.\n\nRead also: Here are the top countries leading the race in digital currency- PwC\n\nDuring the launch, Godwin Emefiele, governor of CBN, said 33 banks, 2,000 customers and 120 merchants had already registered successfully with the platform, which is available via an app on Apple and Android.\n\nChina was the first global economy to pilot a CBDC in 2020 with the digital yuan.

          "title": "Why CBN is pushing for eNaira",
          "text": "Since the launch of the eNaira, a central bank digital currency (CBDC), in October 2021, Nigerians have remained unsure about the true intentions of the government.\n\nMany Nigerians see the eNaira as an alternative to the cryptocurrency, whose growing adoption informed the government\u2019s decision to ban it.\n\nCBDCs are digital tokens, similar to cryptocurrency, issued by a central bank. They are pegged to the value of a country\u2019s fiat currency.\n\nExperts say the federal government came up with a digital currency because there is a high rate of adoption of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria by its youths.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government wants a situation where it can monitor the wallets of the youths. With the use of a distribution ledger technology, of which the digital blockchain is one, transactions or accounts cannot be tracked, or even halted. In contrast, the eNaira is one that can be controlled by the federal government,\u201d Rume Ophi, a crypto trainer, said.\n\nWhile the CBDC thrives in other countries including China, India, Sweden, and Jamaica, Nigeria is still struggling to achieve the purpose for introducing the eNaira.\n\n\u201cCBDC is supposed to aid transactions both within and outside a country but it\u2019s unfortunate that right now, CBDCs are not able to work either or because these currencies have been issued in a manner that is silo-based using different infrastructures peculiar to the government or country which makes it almost technically unusable because of compatibility issues,\u201d Lucky Uwakwe, a blockchain expert, said.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, CBDCs are more cost-efficient than physical cash as they have lower transaction costs. They can also promote financial inclusion; this means that those who are unbanked can get easier and safer access to money on their phone. They can compete with private companies that need incentives to meet transparency standards and limit illicit activity, and can help monetary policy flow more quickly and seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThe amount used for printing physical notes is quite alarming and with the CBDC put in place, sending money will be much easier. But I don\u2019t know of anyone who is using CBDC for transactions in Nigeria. This is because the people are smart and already know what cryptocurrencies can offer which the Nigerian CBDC cannot beat,\u201d Ophi added.\n\nSix months after the eNaira was launched, BusinessDay finds out that although it is in use, the volume it ought to have gathered over the month of existence is low. This, Ophi said, might be as a result of trust.\n\nThe inability of the naira to convert to eNaira despite bank applications having a specific section for it is a major concern. In some cases, accounts will be debited but after sometime, the money will be reversed, making the process abortive.\n\nOphi said: \u201cThe reason CBDC is struggling for relevance in Nigeria is trust. People don\u2019t trust the government and their innovations, unlike crypto that has been in existence for a long time around 2009 and Nigerians joined in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe fuss made about concerns surrounding crypto by the federal government was under the guise of their own motive, plus the advantages of crypto outweigh that of CBDCs.\u201d\n\nSome experts blame the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the challenges facing the CBDC including lack of adequate sensitisation, and inability to make the idea an attractive one. For others, the eNaira came from a vindictive approach, which looked like an attack on the crypto system that is faceless.\n\nFor Ophi, the eNaira is still the naira, nothing changes especially with the dwindling situation of the economy with infrastructures still yet to be put in place, terrible erratic power supply, inflation, and instability in the country\u2019s foreign exchange market.\n\nExperts say CBDCs are supposed to be built such that if Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s CBDCs were to interact, it should be seamless.\n\n\u201cSomebody in China should be able to send their own CBDC to a person in Nigeria and vice-versa, so as to interact on a peer to peer level. The eNaira lacks this functionality coupled with the technical hitches preventing its usage now, despite all the rankings obtained from international surveys which I see as an achievement,\u201d Uwakwe said.\n\nTo clear these challenges, there are certain infrastructures needed to be adopted by the CBN to make the eNaira interoperable. According to Uwakwe, free flow and the carbon blue innovations, among others, are some of these infrastructures. This will aid bilateral trade among businesses.\n\nFree flow finance infrastructure is a World\u2019s First Cross-Border Retail Payments Infrastructure and Digital Finance as-a-Service Platform focused on regulated digital currencies like CBDC where CBDCs can become spendable even beyond border due to their FX infrastructure for CBDCs as well.\n\nRead also: What more to CBN\u2019s e-naira after launch?\n\nBoth the government and the CBN are optimistic about the eNaira because of the economic impact they believe it could have on Nigeria. President Muhammadu Buhari recently said over the next 10 years the eNaira would lead to a $29 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, the CBN governor, said the eNaira would help reduce Nigeria\u2019s heavy reliance on imports. But the question on the mind of experts is how realistic are these goals set for the eNaira.\n\nUwakwe recommends that the infrastructure used to build the eNaira must be upgraded to drive adoption. Integration of application programming interface for banks and other financial institutions to enable connectivity between the eNaira, and banks, traditional and digital payment rails, digital wallets, and other fintechs.\n\nTo solve the settlement challenge in other countries where Nigeria carries out business transactions such as China, Dubai, United States of America and India, the eNaira should be able to settle in these countries without any glitch. Uwakwe says the free flow infrastructure is the best mechanism to achieve this functionality as a CBDC.",

          "text": "2023 Election: I can only contest if I am endorsed by the President-Jonathan\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nGroups reject Jonathan\u2019s candidacy in APC\n\nAspirants looking for consensus are lazy \u2013 Tinubu group\n\nSupport groups working for some presidential aspirants of the party have rejected the consultation between former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and some leaders of the All Progressives Congress for Jonathan to emerge as the presidential candidate.\n\nGroups loyal to the APC National leader and former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; have terminated the consensus plot for the ex-President.\n\nOther members of the party in the presidential race include the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello and the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi.\n\nThe NIGERIAN OBSERVER gathered that Jonathan had informed some APC leaders that he would only join the presidential race if he was directly endorsed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nEarlier The NIGERIAN OBSERVER reported that Jonathan\u2019s posters flooded the national secretariat of the APC and some youth groups stormed Jonathan\u2019s office in the Maitama area of Abuja, calling on him to join the Presidential race.\n\nIn his response, the former President had told protesters that he could not say for sure if he would declare or not but only advised his supporters to \u201cwatch out.\u201d\n\nA member of the APC National Executive Committee who pleaded anonymity said all presidential aspirants were aware of the plan to bring Jonathan in as the consensus candidate.\n\nHowever, he said that members of the Presidency cabal who were working on the plan were not sure whether it would succeed.\n\nThe party chieftain stated, \u201cI can tell you they are facing a tough task as far as Jonathan is concerned. Although from his body language, one can see that Jonathan is interested. However, his backers in the APC are confused about how to launder the public image of Jonathan whom they painted incompetent and clueless in 2015.\n\n\u201cAnother tough task the party may face is how it will convince other aspirants like Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amaechi, Umahi and Bello to step down. Many members are not happy with the plot and are ready to shoot it down.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Leader, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation, Ekiti State, Femi Adeleye, said on Sunday that the party could not give Jonathan a waiver to contest the presidential election as a consensus candidate when there were competent and capable aspirants already.\n\nAdeleye who said the presidential aspirants were already preparing for an indirect primary, however, said the party would adopt Osinbajo in case it considered a consensus arrangement.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEven at that, if all the contestants agree within themselves and decide to step down for one of them, I am very comfortable that our principal, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, will be the one they will step down for. I am very comfortable with that.\n\n\u201cIf some people are rooting for Jonathan, the party must accept him first. And for him to contest, he must have spent a year in the party and our primary will hold in the one month\u2019s time. It will be very difficult for the party to say they want to give him a waiver and pick him as consensus candidate when there are competent hands already on the ground.\u201d\n\nIn a swift response, the South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 known as SWAGA 2023, said that there was no possibility of a consensus presidential candidate in the upcoming primary election.\n\nThe Chairman of SWAGA 2023, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, said, \u201cThe candidates for the presidential election await the primaries and the people will have to earn it. Don\u2019t forget that under the new electoral law, you can only have consensus when all the candidates or aspirants have agreed in writing and I don\u2019t see that happening. Those who are looking for consensus are the lazy ones who have not done any work.\n\n\u201cWe are working and hoping to have free and fair primaries which I know that by the grace of the almighty God, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will easily win. So, the issue of consensus candidacy should be forgotten completely. Nobody will impose the president on Nigeria, the party members will choose their candidates by themselves at the convention and the Nigerian people will be given the opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice in February next year.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye said the Presidential primary would not be like the national convention of March 26 because the primary is more complicated as it would involve a wider electorate.\n\nThe leader of the Grassroot Network for Asiwaju Tinubu group, Mr Abiodun Mafe, also said that Jonathan was not known to be a member of the APC hence he could not be the presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cJonathan has never been a member of the APC, so how will it be possible for anyone to say that he will be made a consensus candidate? Until he now proves to the whole world that he is a card-carrying member of the APC, it can\u2019t be. Even at that, there is a process. Constitutionally, anybody who is a member of the APC has the right to contest but as far as I am concerned Jonathan is not a part,\u201d Mafe stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The exercise was earlier called off due to some logistical bottlenecks.\n\nConsequently, nomination forms for aspirants vying for the House of Assembly would be sold at the various state secretariats of the party nationwide while forms for other positions such as the House of Representatives, Senate, governorship and Presidency would be sold at the national secretariat, Abuja.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The development was driven by the 45.5 per cent and 14.4 per cent lower inflow through the CBN and the autonomous sources, respectively,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cForeign exchange inflow through the Bank at $9.18bn fell below the $16.83bn in the preceding quarter as both oil and non-oil receipts declined, as a result of lower receipts from interest on reserves and interbank swaps.\u201d\n\nA disaggregation showed that proceeds from oil-related sources declined by 12.2 per cent to $1.63bn, relative to the preceding period.\n\nSimilarly, receipts from non-oil sources fell to $7.54bn, compared with $14.97bn in the preceding quarter.\n\nForeign exchange inflow through autonomous sources declined to $11.44bn, relative to $13.37bn in the preceding period, driven mainly by a reduction in over-the-counter purchases and non-oil export receipts.\n\nForeign exchange outflow through the economy rose by 19.4 per cent to $12.21bn, relative to the level in the preceding quarter, majorly on account of increased foreign exchange intervention and utilisation for visible imports.\n\nOutflow through the CBN stood at $10.58bn, indicating a 32.5 per cent increase, relative to $7.98bn in the preceding quarter. This is attributable to increased sales to the I&E window, third-party MDA transfers, public sector direct payments, and Joint Venture cash call payments.\n\nHowever, autonomous outflow decreased by 27.2 per cent to $1.63bn, due to lower utilisation of foreign exchange for invisible imports.\n\nConsequently, the economy recorded a lower net inflow of $8.41bn in the fourth quarter, compared with $19.98bn in the preceding quarter, reflecting the lower net inflow of $9.81bn recorded through autonomous sources.\n\nIn contrast, a net outflow of $1.4bn was recorded through the CBN, compared with a net inflow of $8.85bn in the preceding quarter",

          "text": "The house of representatives committee on public accounts says it would unravel the mystery behind an alleged N2.6 trillion capital allowances granted to MTN by the Federal Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nchairman of the committee, Oluwole Oke, who gave the assurance while speaking at the resumed investigative hearing into the Audit queries on tax evasion issued by the office of the Auditor General for the Federation (oAuGF), said oAuGF report indicated that the documents relating to the N2.6 trillion capital allowances were allegedly forged.\n\nOke, according to Leadership, explained that the oAuGF had in its report observed that Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) accorded value to the telecoms company while in some cases without certificates and evidence of capital allowance issued by Federal Ministry of Trade and Industry reflecting the whole assets procured by the company.\n\n\u201cWe have issues in this country where funds are not adequate for Government to carry out policies and programmes which is why we had to borrow even though there are massive revenue leakages,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMTN has also made appearances where 2.6 trillion was seen as the taxable value for assets of the company and we asked as to where they exist and who verified them, because they had already claimed value for them with the FIRS,\u201d he said.\n\nHe argued that Nigerians have rights to know the implications of MTN taking a certificate of N2.6 trillion to FIRS for tax waivers on the economy.\n\n\u201cThe Parliament simply wants to know whether it should sustain the query raised by the Auditor General or absolve the company of the allegations of tax evasion as it would be wrong to accuse it of such if these records tally with the comany\u2019s submission,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe issue says that we should speak to facts and law. You\u2019re here when we asked the Industry Ministry and they said both the local and foreign contents were the certificates they issued to you.\n\n\u201cHowever, Auditor General says such issuance appears to have been falsified which was the basis of its query to you,\u201d he observed.\n\nWhile responding, MTN\u2019s general manager, Mrs. Yemisi Adebayo explained that the Company has submitted all relevant documents issued by Federal Ministry of Trade and Industry reflecting the value of N2.6 trillion given to MTN.\n\nAddressing questions on the 2016 inspection relating to the capital allowances granted to the company, Mrs. Adebayo said the company made claims to Federal Ministry of Trade and Industry at the end of the year prompting them to choose a location and inspect as it was physically impossible for them to inspect thousands of assets across the country.\n\nShe said what the Company had in 2016 was the automated card record bearing Ins and Outs of the team leader, one Mr. Ike.\n\nWhen asked how many people were on the team with Mr. Ike who had the access card and inspected assets from 29th of March to April 4th, she said she couldn\u2019t remember the identities of the ministry officials as the team members were not captured individually in the record.\n\nShe said what they presented to the FIRS was what their security team gave to them.\n\nWhen asked again if the ministry wrote the company informing it of the inspection date and the list of team members or just by words of mouth, Mrs. Adebayo said that the Ministry formally communicated to that effect.\n\nAlso asked how many assets did they inspect within the five days, she said she could not recall.\n\nShe argued that the most expensive of the company\u2019s infrastructure are warehoused in their switches located in Ojota Lagos, Port Harcourt, among other places.\n\nWhile giving details on the claims made by the company for capital allowance, she disclosed that the sum of N18,967,410,769 was claimed in 2016.\n\nShe said in 2017 a log book was brought back reading Abuja switch with Mr. Ike and three others as inspection team members.\n\nAccording to her, total sum of N148 billion capital allowance was granted to the company, while N210 billion was approved in 2018 after the visit to Ojota Switch as well as N190,629,586,000 in 2019 following visit to the Port Harcourt switch, Leadership reported.\n\nWhen asked if all the assets procured by the company in 2019 were all located at the Port Harcourt switch, she responded in the negative.\n\nShe added that in 2020, the Ministry officials visited Abuja Switch, another team visited Ojota switch, while another visited Port Harcourt and granted capital allowance worth N219,540,623,545.\n\nWhen asked if she would agree to give out a value of N219 billion based on one inspection that visited just three locations out of over a thousand locations, she said the company only filed what was approved by the inspection team with the FIRS for consideration.\n\nHowever, Hon. Oke reiterated the Committee\u2019s resolve to ascertain the patriotic and professional involvement of the Ministry officials, saying that the Parliament cannot fold its arms and watch when people whose salaries and allowances were appropriated to do a job failed to carry out their duties under the law.\n\nTo this end, the committee resolved that all the officials involved in the inspection from Federal Ministry of Trade and Industry should be made to appear before it.\n\nThe committee equally requested for the tax records covering the periods under review from both MTN and FIRS for further legislative scrutiny.",

          "text": "As one of the five pillars of Islam, Ramadan is basically a period for spiritual awakening and rejuvenation for all Muslims. It is a time when Muslims observe the one month fasting period which usually dovetails into the festival of Eid el fitri. During the holy month of Ramadan, intensify prayers for the forgiveness of sins while abstaining from acts that are abhorrent to the dictums of the Islamic injunction.\n\nAsides from the spirituality attached to the Holy month of Ramadan, some other good virtues like the Ramadan Iftar (Breaking of Fast) equally abound among the Ummah.\n\nThis symbolic practice as observed by many Islamic scholars, epitomizes love and shared feelings among the Ummah for the eventual attainment of a common goal of peace and unity of purpose, particularly in Islam and humanity in general. In Gombe State, these fine virtues of Ramadan Iftar were on full display as Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya specifically directed an itinerary for the breaking of Ramadan fast with Groups, Associations and individuals in the State.\n\nFirst it was the APC Elders Forum, then followed by Members of the Gombe State House of Assembly and then APC Executives in the State. Others are the appointees of the State Governor, the business community, trade union leaders, friends and associates as well as chairmen of local government councils and members of boards and commissions. Permanent Secretaries alongside top civil servants in the State, political support groups and IPAC, heads of federal agencies in the State as well as the media were equally not left out in the two- week long Ramadan Iftar.\n\nHowever, Beyond the exchange of pleasantries and the chemistry which the Iftar conjures between the Governor and his guests, there were speeches that made the symbolic breaking of the Ramadan fast even more unique and worth remembering. For instance during the Iftar with his political support groups and the Inter-Party Advisory Council IPAC, Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya was emphatic on the need for such groups to play politics according to the rules.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis brazen show of support and solidarity for a rancour-free electioneering campaign that is fast approaching in the country is not only statemanly but a sheer patriotism enmeshed in an undiluted love for country, in view of the fact not too many of a typical Nigerian politician are religiously in the habit of making such a clarion call. Furthermore, as a leader of a State, Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya equally used the Ramadan Iftar to give account of his stewardship in the last 3 years.\n\nIn one of his remarks, the Governor observed that in spite of the economic downturn occasioned by the covid-19 Pandemic, his administration was able to set in motion processes that have so far positioned the State as a social, economic and infrastructural powerhouse especially within the North East sub-region and beyond.\n\nGovernor Inuwa Yahaya who was once described by the chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum and Governor of Ekiti Dr. John Kayode Feyemi as a \u201csilent storm\u201d did not stop short at assuring the people of the State of his administration\u2019s commitment to keep executing policies and programmes that have direct bearing on the lives of the common people.\n\nPerhaps stunned by Governor\u2019s show of quintessential leadership, spokesmen and women of the various groups and Associations expressed gratitude to Inuwa Yahaya for deeming it right to organise the Ramadan Iftar for them. The groups and Associations took turns to eulogise the incredible performance of Governor Inuwa Yahaya in the last 3 years. Most of them were however particular on the multi billion naira Muhammadu Buhari Industrial Park which they observed when completed it will create thousands of jobs to the teeming unemployed youths in the State and position Gombe as Industrial hub. The groups did not however shy away from reaffirming their support for Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya which they unanimously say deserve a second term. For Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, the Holy month of Ramadan is a time for absolute communion with the Almighty Allah and Strengthening the existing bond between his administration and the people. His thoughts and prayers at every session of the Ramadan Iftar depict a classical leader with the insatiable desire for the well being of his people.",

This Ideology also seems the best suited to meet the expectations and aspirations of my constituents.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking you, Mr. President, please, accept the assurances of my highest consideration.\u201d\n\nAttempts by Senators Philip Aduda (PDP, FCT) and Lilian Uche Ekwunife (PDP, Anambra Central), to rely on point of orders to stop Mr Danbaba\u2019s defection were unsuccessful as the Senate President ruled them out of order.\n\nMs Ekwunife, while relying on the provisions of Section 68(g) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), requested that Mr Danbaba\u2019s seat be declared vacant.\n\nThe Senate President, however, ruled her out of order, explaining that the reasons advanced by Mr Danbaba were valid and excusable under the law.",

I am aware of what is going on and the deal thrown at Jonathan.\n\n\u201cSome APC governors, also known are the ones asking Jonathan to throw his hat in the ring. From what I know and the meeting I attended, they sold the idea to Buhari. Jonathan has already met Buhari in the villa and the deal has been sealed. The game is that he will only serve one term (because he cannot do two terms having been elected for the first term earlier) and hand over to his vice, who will come from the North-East.\n\n\u201cThey know that the former president is obedient and will do their bidding, they have seen it in the past. As you know, the North still wants to retain power and that is why they are throwing the offer at him.\u201d\n\nAnother source told Vanguard that the presidency is not looking in the direction of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo or Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in 2023. \u201cThey do not want Tinubu or Osinbajo. In fact, what worked against Osinbajo is that they see him as an extension of Bola Tinubu, who still defers to Tinubu.\u201d\n\nHowever, the source concluded by expressing caution, saying, \u201cthings are still in a state of flux and last-minute jostling may still upturn the arrangement.\u201d",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has raised the alarm over alleged plot by some criminal elements to bomb worship and recreational centres as well as return the country to pre-2015 general elections during and after Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nThe Service in a press release by the Public Relations Office, Dr Peter Afunanya, titled: Public Alert on Renewed Bomb Explosions, Tuesday in Abuja, said: \u201cThe DSS hereby draws public attention to plans by criminal elements to return the country to the pre-2015 era reminiscent of IED attacks on soft and hard targets in parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThough there are already reported cases of such incidents in some areas, the Service has uncovered a ploy by suspected criminal gangs to forge an alliance among themselves with a view to launching further attacks on critical infrastructure and other frequented public places like worship and relaxation centres, especially during and after the holidays and festive celebrations.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to achieve some self- serving interests as well as cause fear among the citizenry. The Service, however, recalls its earlier warning that some groups and individuals were plotting to stoke violence in the country.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson further said: \u201cFollowing these, patrons, owners and managers of aforementioned public places are advised to be wary of this development and implement basic security measures to deter the threats. While the Service is committed to the disruption of this trend and pattern of violent attacks, it will continue to partner with other security agencies to ensure that necessary drills are emplaced in order that public peace and order are not jeopardised.\n\n\u201cTo this end, residents are enjoined to go about their lawful businesses and share, with security and law enforcement agencies, useful information on the activities of criminals.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that, \u201cThe DSS Director General (DGSS), Alhaji Yusuf Magaji Bichi, wishes all and sundry a hitch free Workers\u2019 Day and Sallah celebrations.\u201d\n\nBandits strike\n\nIn a related development, bandits Monday night stormed a community killing the All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman of Aribi Ward, Kagarko local government area of Kaduna state, Mr Iliya Auta and injured one other person in his company.\n\nThe bandits also shot to death a farmer simply called Tanko in Kuchi village and injured another person, while they made away with eight motorcycles and several cattle after attacking various communities in Kagarko local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nThough, Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige and Kaduna state government have yet to confirm the incident, a competent source from the community, who did not want his name mentioned, said the APC chairman was killed on his farm while another person with him was shot, and receiving treatment at a hospital in Kagarko town.\n\nAccording to the source, Iliya was not the target of the bandits who were apparently on a mission when they saw him on his farm making a call beside his car, a move they mistook that he was calling to report their presence, hence he was shot to death as a result.\n\nThe source said, \u201cthe APC Ward Chairman went to his farm and after close of work on his farm, he was about going back home but his car developed an electrical fault and he was trying to call an electrician to help come and fix it not knowing that the bandits were behind him.\n\n\u201cThe bandits thought he was calling the villagers to report their presence, that was how they shot him and he died instantly and the other person with him also sustained bullet shot and receiving treatment at Kagarko hospital now.\n\n\u201cOne other person by name Tanko was killed in another village called Kuchi and another person sustained injury and in critical condition in the hospital. The bandits also made away with eight motorcycles and several cattle but to the best of my knowledge, there was no kidnap of persons.\u201d\n\nAnother source however said unconfirmed number of persons were abducted after the attacks that took place Monday night within and around communities in Kagarko local government area.\n\nCSO on foreign support\n\nMeanwhile, a Civil Society Organisation, Integrity Advocacy for Development Initiative and Centre for Peace and Transparency and Accountability,\n\nhas called on the federal government \u201cto seek functional foreign partnership especially in the area of improved crime detection, crime arrest management technology & hardware.\u201d\n\nThe CSO also advised \u201cfor the improvement of human resource expertise of the Nigerian military, police and the paramilitary agencies.\u201d\n\nAt a state-of-the-nation press conference addressed Tuesday by the leader, Comrade Patrick Ogheneyero, the group said \u201cthe use of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme to support the military and law enforcement structures of Nigeria is another worthy consideration.\u201d\n\nThe group also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to continue to engage the governors, the Council of State, civil society groups in all communities within the 774 LGs, religious and traditional rulers, the media and other sundry critical stakeholders via Town Hall meetings as a means of achieving autonomy for local governments.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is noteworthy to applaud the good intentions of President Muhammadu Buhari towards the achievement of autonomous local government in Nigeria, especially, the creation of NFIU-Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit which is birthed to ensure direct funding of local governments from the federation account with the primary intention to improve the economic capacity of Local Governments to steer change in the grassroots which inadvertently would only consequent to economic development of Nigeria in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the lack of cooperation by governors for reasons of easier administration of LGs as the governors claim, but we sympathize with the intention of the President.\n\n\u201cIt is in the best interest of the Nigerian people and so we admonish him to continue engaging the governors, the Council of State, Civil Society groups in all communities within the 774 LGs, religious and traditional rulers, the media and other sundry critical stakeholders within the Nigerian space via Town Hall meetings,\u201d they further said.\n\nHe said,\u201dcommunity policing, and the dire need for citizens engagement and involvement in security of our communities cannot be overstretched.\u201d\n\nWhile recalling that unemployment rate in Nigeria between 2014 to 2020 had risen to an alarming rate of 35.3%, the group appealed to the federal government \u201cto intensify effort on the Nigerian youth employment action plan 2021 to 2024, review fiscal and monetary policies in the direction that will encourage the ease of doing business which inadvertently stimulate the growth of Small and Medium Scale enterprises (SMSE\u2019s).\n\n\u201cWe also call on all Nigerian governors to also replicate same in their respective states because the unemployed/unengaged youth is a ready tool for all vices and crime.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nNigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources has unveiled plans for the 6th edition of the Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES 2023). The official Oil and Gas meeting of the Federal Republic will take place in Abuja from April 16th to 20th, 2023.\n\nThe speed of change projected in the fossil fuels segment as the world pursues the energy transition agenda gave rise to the theme of NIES 2023, which is; \u201cGlobal Perspectives for a Sustainable Energy Future\u201d.\n\n\u201cNIES 2023 will put on the front burner overarching global energy trends and perspectives so that policy makers and other players in the sector can more easily understand latest developments and the best roadmap to drive the energy transition\u201d, says Mr. James Shindi, Managing Director of Brevity Anderson, the event producer.\n\nIn an online media broadcast, Chief Timipre Sylva, Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, said \u201cNIES 2023 is primed to be a show stopper as it will be the valedictory edition of this administration\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe event will provide the platform for the administration to present its scorecard in the energy sector and also provide the opportunity to offer a roadmap for the next administration.

          "text": "By Asuelimen Osasuyi\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami and the Executive Vice Chairman, EVC, of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, have promised to continue to drive policy initiatives that promote investment in infrastructure in the Nigerian telecom industry in order to deepen connectivity to enhance the nation\u2019s growth and development.\n\nThe duo stated this on the sideline of the reception marking the landing of the Equiano undersea Cable System in Nigeria at the Open Access Data Centre at Lekki in Lagos. Pantami and Danbatta commended Google LLC, the West Indian Ocean Cable Company, WIOCC, and other investors for bringing additional bandwidth capacity into the country to drive connectivity and growth.\n\nWhile Pantami was represented at the event by NCC\u2019s Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, Danbatta was represented by the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services at NCC, Ubale Maska. Other senior management staff of the Commission at the event included the NCC\u2019s Director, Technical Standards and Network Integrity, Bako Wakil, and the Controller, NCC\u2019s Ibadan Zonal Office, Yomi Arowosafe.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the Federal Government, through the Ministry, will continue to drive the implementation of existing digital economy-oriented policies already put in place by the current administration. Pantami also promised an enabling environment that encourages foreign and local investment in infrastructure project such as the way Google and its co-investors have done.\n\nAlso commenting, Danbatta said the Commission\u2019s expectations, initiatives, and vision towards increasing broadband penetration, quality of service, advancement of a digital economy, and commitment to improving national security through technological advancement, are on the priority list of its regulatory interventions.\n\nDanbatta expressed delight that Equiano has joined the list of other submarine cables at the shores of Nigeria, including SAT3 cable, MainOne cable, Glo1 cable as well as the African Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine cable by Dolphin and West African Cable System (WACS) by MTN.\n\nThe EVC assured stakeholders of Commission\u2019s commitment toward ensuring that the huge bandwidth capacity from these cables at shore in Lagos would be transmitted to different part of the country to drive robust and ubiquitous infrastructure. This is in keeping with the provisions of the digital economy policy being implemented by government in collaboration with all stakeholders.\n\nThe EVC expressed optimism that Google\u2019s investment in the subsea cable, Equiano, will be significant in driving NCC\u2019s ongoing implementation of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025, which aims at increasing broadband penetration to 70 per cent by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that Equiano, together with earlier undersea cables in the country, will have additional landing points in the hinterlands through collaborative efforts with NCC-licensed Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos). This will help to reduce retail data prices significantly and thereby complementing the Commission\u2019s efforts at ensuring that affordable Internet services are available to boost Commission\u2019s ongoing broadband policy initiatives,\u201d Danbatta stated, reiterating the objective linkages of policies and plans in the telecom ecosystem, and the national economic strategies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who also witnessed the unveiling of the Google\u2019s submarine cable, underscored the cable\u2019s centrality to Nigeria\u2019s ongoing efforts to boost job creation and contribution to the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), over the next three years.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of WIOCC, Chris Wood, also described the landing of the submarine cables as a major investment in the Nigerian digital economy.\n\nThe new cable system is named after a Nigerian hero, Olaudah Equiano, who survived enslavement in the 18th century and went on to become a famous writer and anti-slavery activist. Besides, the triumph over challenges, which Equiano\u2019s life symbolised, the landing of the cable in Nigeria is expected to underscore Nigeria\u2019s leadership as a regional hub for connectivity, and thus, set to attract cloud operators, content providers, content distribution networks and their associated ecosystems.",

We made some progress,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his side, Dr Adesina said the Russia-Ukraine war would create global problems, and particularly for Africa, which imports a huge percentage of its food from the two countries.\n\n\u201cAlready, the price of wheat has gone up about 60%. Maize and other grains will also be affected. There may be a fertilizer crisis, as there would be about a 2 million metric ton deficit. And that will affect food production by about 20%. Africa will lose $11 billion worth of food, and coming shortly after COVID-19, that would be rather serious,\u201d the AfDB President disclosed.\n\nTo prepare against the evil day, Dr Adesina said the AfDB has developed a $1.5 billion Africa Emergency Food Plan, which is now before the bank\u2019s Board for approval.\n\n\u201cWe were not ready for COVID-19, but we are now planning to avert food crisis on the continent. There is a plan to help farmers cultivate wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, and soybeans. It will mitigate the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war,\u201d be explained.\n\nTalking specifically of Nigeria, the Nigerian-born Adesina, and a former Minister of Agriculture, said in the wet season of 2022, at least 5 million smallholder farmers would be helped to cultivate 1 million hectares of maize, 1 million hectares of rice, and 250,000 hectares of sorghum and soybeans, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn total, our support will help Nigeria to produce 9.5 million metric tons of food.\u201d\n\nStates that will benefit from the assistance include Kano, Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna, Imo, Cross River, and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nDr Adesina submitted: \u201cMr. President, you have a passion for agriculture. We are behind you strongly, and we want to ensure Nigeria won\u2019t feel the impact of the food crisis.\u201d",

We need to do all of this,\u201d she will add.\n\n\u201cThere must be nowhere for Putin to go to fund this appalling war.\u201d\n\nTruss will also urge Europe to cut off Russian energy imports \u201conce and for all\u201d \u2014 a move that would deprive Moscow of a key source of leverage over its dependent western neighbours.\n\nUnderlining that precarity, energy giant Gazprom said Wednesday it had informed Bulgaria\u2019s Bulgargaz and Poland\u2019s PGNiG about the \u201csuspension of gas supplies from April 27 until payment is made\u201d in rubles.\n\nPresident Putin last month said Russia would only accept payment for deliveries in its national currency.\n\nOn The Brink\n\nFighting continues to rage across Ukraine\u2019s east, Kyiv\u2019s defence ministry said, announcing Wednesday that Russian forces had pushed deeper into the east of the country and captured several villages as part of its offensive to take control of Donbas.\n\nRussia said it had carried out high-precision missile strikes against 32 Ukrainian military targets including four ammunition depots on Tuesday.\n\nIt also launched air strikes against 33 targets, as well as 100 artillery and rocket strikes.\n\nIn the south, two Russian missiles struck the industrial city of Zaporizhzhia, which has welcomed many civilians fleeing Mariupol, regional authorities said.\n\nRussian forces are expected to soon advance on the city, which is located near Ukraine\u2019s largest nuclear power plant.\n\nAnd at the site of the world\u2019s world-ever atomic disaster, Chernobyl in northern Ukraine observed the 36th anniversary of the meltdown back under Kyiv\u2019s control.\n\nThe sprawling complex fell into Russian hands on the day Moscow\u2019s troops began their invasion in February, suffered a power and communications outage that raised alarm about a possible new calamity at the site.\n\nThat put the world \u201con the brink of disaster\u201d, Zelensky said at a press conference with UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi, adding that Russian troops\u2019 conduct showed that \u201cno one in the world can feel safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the Russian military, the Chernobyl zone and the plant was like a normal battleground, territory where they didn\u2019t even try to care about nuclear safety,\u201d he said.\n\nTo the east, at the entrance to Barvinkove, six Ukrainian soldiers were ready at any moment to dive into their trench, which they dig every day with a shovel.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re dead,\u201d said Vasyl, 51, who serves with his 22-year-old son Denys.\n\nUkraine officials said there was fighting all along the frontlines in the Donetsk region, and that resistance in the Azovstal factory in the besieged port city of Mariupol was still holding out.\n\nThe country\u2019s best-known singer Sviatoslav Vakarchuk made a morale-boosting visit to the eastern front, where a military press officer admitted the situation was difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far from rosy,\u201d Iryna Rybakova, of the 93rd brigade, told AFP.\n\n\u201cOf course, we were prepared for this war, especially the professional army, but for those who\u2019ve been recruited, it\u2019s more complicated.\u201d\n\nThe UN\u2019s refugee agency said it now expects more than eight million Ukrainians to eventually flee their country, with nearly 5.3 million already out, and that $1.85 billion would be needed to host them in neighbouring countries.\n\nIn a meeting with Putin, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for Moscow and Kyiv to work together to set up aid and evacuation corridors in war-torn Ukraine.\n\nHe also called for an independent investigation into \u201cpossible war crimes\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the repeated reports of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and possible war crimes,\u201d Guterres said.\n\n\u201cAnd they require independent investigation for effective accountability.\u201d\n\nburs-oho/je\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse",

No. God does not make mistakes. He provided those opportunities such that one day, I will be called upon to serve in the highest capacity \u2014 to serve as president of our nation.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to do so is an important one.

          "text": "Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu has asked the two major political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, to zone their 2023 presidential ticket to south east geopolitical zone and see the Igbos turn around the economy of the country.\n\nHe said that in the case of the south east, power must be given and not taken, describing the age-long political maxim that political power is taken and not given as \u201clamba\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, such was the case at the birth of this 4th republic in 1999 when power was given to the south west.\n\nKalu also said he was so much in the race to become the next president of Nigeria, dispelling speculations that he had dropped his ambition.\n\nKalu, who was also a governor of Abia State said that he was greatly misunderstood in the statement he issued on Tuesday over the decision to pursue his presidential ambition if the two major political parties zone their tickets to the south east zone.\n\nIn a statement he made available to Vanguard on Wednesday, Kalu said: \u201cIam surprised that a statement as unambiguous and clearly comprehensible as mine was still misunderstood yesterday.\n\n\u201cIn the least clear term, I had requested that other regions should support the South East to be president, especially our own brothers from the South. I added that I will run for president if the party zones the ticket to the South East.\n\n\u201cSome people continue to throw this lamba that \u201cpower is not given but taken.\u201d In reality, for a Southerner to become president of Nigeria, power is given and not taken. Power was given to the South West in 1999. Power was given to the South South in 2011. In 2015, the North did not give power to the South and that was why a sitting president lost. Unless for mischievous and selfish reasons against the South East, no one can comfortably deny these facts.\n\n\u201cAs long as the Presidency of Nigerian is concerned, any pointer to equity and fairness is South East and North East, otherwise, and as I strongly advocated, Buhari\u2019s kinsmen, including his wife is free to run for the office of the president in 2023. It is very ungodly and immoral for any Southerner to talk about fairness and equity, but sees no fairness in working hard to cease the third meat that belongs to their remaining brother.\n\n\u201cNone of the other aspirants is more Nigerian than me. Aside the capacity and what it takes to govern a country as diverse as Nigeria, I remain the most detribalized living Nigeria today and these are verifiable facts.\n\n\u201cIt is a false claim and an old propaganda that the South East is not united in this contest. In this pursuit for presidency, there is nothing the South East is doing that is different from what others are doing. Let the two major political parties zone their tickets to the South East and see the miracle that will happen to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd for clarification purpose, I am still in the presidential race. My statement yesterday did not state that I withdrew from the race.\n\n\u201cHere is part of the statement issued on Tuesday : \u201cIt is my desire and intention to run for the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I am committed to this pursuit, but I can\u2019t make an official declaration to this regard without the full support of other regions.\n\n\u201cI have been in the frontline of the call that the two major political parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should zone their presidential tickets to the South East as they did for the South West in 1999. In the absence of this zoning, I shall return to the senate and stay away from the presidential contest.\u201d",

The venue of the declaration was filled to the brim while an almost equal crowd was seen outside the venue, with many support groups clad in different distinct attires, chanting solidarity songs.\n\n\u201cWith the payment for the forms, Governor Bello\u2019s teeming supporters should rest assured that he will be on the ballot in the 2023 presidential race. We are highly encouraged by the number of APC Governors, leaders and stakeholders who have demonstrated their strong support for the candidacy of our Principal. We reiterate that he is not known for betrayal. He is always very loyal to his own and his priorities have always been Nigeria, Nigeria and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThough the race officially begins now, it is on record that Governor Bello has consistently been at the forefront of the contest. He has demonstrated this again by being the first to pay for the forms.\n\n\u201cWe urge delegates and indeed all Nigerians to shun divisive narratives in the interest of the nation and choose the best of the lot. We have no doubt that our tested and trusted National Working Committee members will put the interest of the party and that of Nigeria first in their activities around the process that will throw up the next flagbearer of the APC,\u201d the Director, Media and Publicity, Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, Yemi Kolapo, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe last few months have witnessed persistent calls by different youth, women and professional groups across Nigeria on the Kogi State governor to contest for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nWith Senator Jonathan Zwingina as the Chairman of the Hope \u201923 Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, and Hafsat Abiola-Costello as the Director-General, the tone is set for Hope to be actualized for Nigerians in 2023, the campaign organization said.",

          "text": "Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya is famed for its Scramble Crossing, where crowds of people crisscross the intersection in a scene symbolizing urban Japan\u2019s congestion and anonymity. It may have added another boasting right.\n\nTokyu Railways\u2019 trains running through Shibuya and other stations were switched to power generated only by solar and other renewable sources starting April 1.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThat means the carbon dioxide emissions of Tokyu\u2019s sprawling network of seven train lines and one tram service now stand at zero, with green energy being used at all its stations, including for vending machines for drinks, security camera screens and lighting.\n\nTokyu, which employs 3,855 people and connects Tokyo with nearby Yokohama, is the first railroad operator in Japan to have achieved that goal. It says the carbon dioxide reduction is equivalent to the annual average emissions of 56,000 Japanese households.\n\nNicholas Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University\u2019s Center for Railway Research and Education, commends Tokyu for promoting renewable energy but stressed the importance of boosting the bottom-line amount of that renewable energy.\n\n\u201cI would stress the bigger impacts come from increasing electricity generation from renewable sources,\u201d he said. \u201cThe long-term battle is to increase production of renewable electricity and provide the transmission infrastructure to get it to the places of consumption.\u201d\n\nThe technology used by Tokyu\u2019s trains is among the most ecologically friendly options for railways. The other two options are batteries and hydrogen power.\n\nAnd so is it just a publicity stunt, or is Tokyu moving in the right direction?\n\nRyo Takagi, a professor at Kogakuin University and specialist in electric railway systems, believes the answer isn\u2019t simple because how train technology evolves is complex and depends on many uncertain societal factors.\n\nIn a nutshell, Tokyu\u2019s efforts are definitely not hurting and are probably better than doing nothing. They show the company is taking up the challenge of promoting clean energy, he said.\n\n\u201cBut I am not going out of my way to praise it as great,\u201d Takagi said.\n\nBigger gains would come from switching from diesel trains in rural areas to hydrogen powered lines and from switching gas-guzzling cars to electric, he said.\n\nTokyu paid an undisclosed amount to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility behind the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, for certification vouching for its use of renewables, even as Japan continues to use coal and other fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as reaching our goal but just a start,\u201d said Assistant Manager Yoshimasa Kitano at Tokyu\u2019s headquarters, a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Scramble Crossing.\n\nSuch steps are crucial for Japan, the world\u2019s sixth-biggest carbon emitter, to attain its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\nOnly about 20% of Japan\u2019s electricity comes from renewable sources, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, a Tokyo-based independent non-profit research organization.\n\nThat lags way behind New Zealand, for instance, where 84% of power used comes from renewable energy sources. New Zealand hopes to make that 100% by 2035.\n\nThe renewable sources driving Tokyu trains include hydropower, geothermal-power, wind power and solar power, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that provides the electricity and tracks its energy sourcing.\n\nTokyu has more than 100 kilometers (64 miles) of railway tracks serving 2.2 million people a day, including commuting \u201csalarymen\u201d and \u201csalarywomen\u201d and schoolchildren in uniforms.\n\nSince the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, when a tsunami set off by a massive earthquake sent three reactors into meltdowns, Japan has shut down most of its nuclear plants and ramped up use of coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe country aims to have 36%-38% of its energy come from renewable sources by 2030, while slashing overall energy use.\n\nTokyu Railways has sought to publicize its effort with posters and YouTube clips.\n\nStill, Ryuichi Yagi, who heads his own company that used to make neckties but has switched to wallets appeared surprised to learn he was riding on a \u201cgreen train.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no idea,\u201d he said.\n\nYagi switched his business because of Japan\u2019s \u201ccool biz\u201d movement. It encourages male office workers to doff their suits for open-necked short-sleeve shirts to conserve energy by keeping air conditioning to a minimum in hot summer months.\n\nIn a sense, he said, \u201cI lead a very green life.\u201d\n\nAP",

          "text": "Russian energy firm Gazprom said on Wednesday it had halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland for failing to pay for gas in roubles, the Kremlin\u2019s toughest retaliation yet to international sanctions over the war in Ukraine.\n\nPoland confirmed that supplies had been cut, while Bulgaria said it would find out soon. Both accused Gazprom of breaching longstanding supply contracts.\n\n\u201cBecause all trade and legal obligations are being observed, it is clear that at the moment the natural gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war,\u201d Bulgarian Energy Minister Alexander Nikolov said.\n\nGazprom said in a statement it had \u201ccompletely suspended gas supplies to Bulgargaz and PGNiG due to absence of payments in roubles,\u201d referring to the Polish and Bulgarian gas companies.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin demanded that buyers from \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries pay for gas in roubles or be cut off, starting from the date payments are due for April. The European Union has rejected this demand as rewriting contracts that called for payment in euros.\n\nPoland receives its Russian gas through the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Russia\u2019s huge gas fields in the Arctic far north, which continues west to supply Germany and other European countries. Bulgaria is supplied through pipes over Turkey.\n\nPolish state-owned PGNiG confirmed its supplies from Gazprom had been cut but said it was still supplying its own clients as needed.\n\n\u201cCutting gas supplies is a breach of contract and PGNiG reserves the right to seek compensation and will use all available contractual and legal means to do so,\u201d the company said.\n\nSupplies from Gazprom cover about 50% of Poland\u2019s consumption and about 90% of Bulgaria\u2019s. Poland said it did not need to draw on reserves and its gas storage was 76% full. Bulgaria has said it is in talks to try to import liquefied natural gas through Turkey and Greece.\n\nRussia\u2019s energy exports had until now continued largely unhindered since the war began, the biggest loophole in sanctions that have otherwise cut off Moscow from much of its trade with the West.\n\nKyiv has called on Europe to stop funding Moscow\u2019s war effort by cutting off energy imports that bring Russia hundreds of millions of dollars a day.\n\nGermany, the biggest buyer of Russian energy, said this week it is hoping to stop importing Russian oil within days. But weaning Europe off cheap and abundant Russian natural gas, which heats its houses, fuels its factories and drives its electric power plants, would be a far more disruptive prospect.\n\nAndriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was \u201cbeginning the gas blackmail of Europe\u201d.\n\n\u201cRussia is trying to shatter the unity of our allies,\u201d Yermak said.\n\nRUSSIA MAKES GAINS IN EAST\n\nSince the Russian invasion force was driven back at the outskirts of Kyiv last month, Moscow has refocused its operation on eastern Ukraine, starting a new offensive from several directions to fully capture two provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff acknowledged that Russia had made gains at a number of areas in the east, capturing outskirts of the towns of Velyka Komyshuvakha and Zavody on one front, and the Zarichne and Novoshtokivske settlements in Donetsk region.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said its missiles had struck an arms depot in Zaporizhzhia region housing weapons from the United States and European countries.\n\nAn aide to the mayor of the port city of Mariupol said Russian forces had renewed their attacks on the Azovstal steel plant, where fighters and some civilians are holed up. No agreements had been reached on trying to evacuate civilians from Mariupol on Wednesday, aide Petro Andryushchenko also said.\n\nUkraine said it had attacked Snake Island, a Black Sea outpost seized by Russia early in the war when defenders became heroes to Ukrainians for rejecting a Russian demand to surrender with an obscenity.\n\nThere has been increasing concern over the prospect of the conflict widening to neighbouring Moldova, where pro-Russian separatists in a small region occupied since the 1990s by Russian troops have reported several explosions in recent days.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a \u201cspecial operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West call this is a pretext for an unprovoked war to seize territory.\n\nThe United States and its allies have increasingly been supplying Ukraine with heavy weapons for the fight in the east. More than 40 countries met at a U.S. air base in Germany on Tuesday to discuss Ukraine\u2019s defence. Germany announced its first delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine, including Gepard light tanks equipped with anti-aircraft guns.\n\nAMMUNITION DUMP BURNS IN RUSSIA\n\nBlasts were heard in the early hours of Wednesday in three Russian provinces bordering Ukraine, authorities said, and an ammunition depot in the Belgorod province caught fire. The regional governor said the blaze near Staraya Nelidovka village had been put out and no civilians had been hurt.\n\nRussia this month accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod with helicopters and opening fire on several villages in the province. A massive fire also broke out this week at a fuel depot in nearby Bryansk. Ukraine does not confirm responsibility for reported incidents on Russian territory.\n\nBritish military intelligence said Ukraine retained control over most of its air space and Russia had failed to effectively destroy Ukraine\u2019s air force or its air defences.\n\nReuters",

These are states that were not earlier covered by funding from the Global Fund Out of this amount, $10 million is grant while $90 million is loan,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking on efforts to reduce malaria disease in the country, Unomoibni said the programme was implementing environmental management initiative in collaboration with the Nigeria Space Research Agency (NASDA), \u201cto identify some of water bodies where we have malaria hot spots in the country.\u201d\n\nShe also said the programme was working with various line ministries such the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Education in carrying out malaria research.\n\nAccording to her tackling malaria scourge requires a multi sectoral collaboration.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday revealed that none of the African countries has been able to meet the COVID-19 vaccination target of 40 per cent eligible population. It revealed that only 18.7 per cent of the Africa\u2019s population had been fully vaccinated.\n\nThe latest update on Covid-19 vaccination came just as Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire said experts from the country recently completed a technology training programme on vaccine production that held in South Africa.\n\nSpeaking on this year\u2019s theme: \u201cLong Life for All\u201d, WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti said tens of millions of people were still missing out on some, or all, their scheduled immunisation against diseases that have long been eradicated by vaccines.\n\n\u201cAlthough 480 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Africa to date, making it the biggest vaccine rollout in the history of the continent, only 18.7 per cent of the African population is fully vaccinated \u2013 lagging woefully behind the global average of 58 per cent,\u201d she said.\n\nMoeti said more than a year into the COVID-19 global vaccine rollout, Africa had been benefiting from the speedy, efficient development of vaccines to curb the virus.\n\nAccording to her, there are currently ten COVID-19 vaccines available through the COVAX Facility, with more in the research and development pipeline.\n\nMoeti said that WHO, together with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, World Bank, the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has identified 20 priority countries in the WHO African Region for intensified support.\n\nHe added that multi-partner country support teams are currently on the ground helping countries with technical and financial resources to ramp up overall and high-priority group COVID-19 vaccination coverage.\n\n\u201cAs we work to accelerate COVID-19 vaccination efforts, it is critical that we don\u2019t ignore the urgent need to also strengthen routine immunisation efforts.\n\n\u201cSince 2020, routine immunisation has been negatively impacted by COVID-19 containment measures, leading to tens of millions of infants in Africa missing out on essential childhood vaccinations. These include the Diphtheria, Tetanus toxoid and Pertussis (whooping cough)-containing vaccine, as well as the measles vaccine.\n\n\u201cAs WHO in Africa, we urge all countries to ramp up routine immunisation and COVID-19 vaccination efforts concurrently, allocating the necessary resources. Maintaining routine immunisation services, despite the shift of resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in the past two years, is more cost-effective, and will lead to longer life for all,\u201d she said.\n\nEhanire who briefed journalists on the update on COVID19 intervention efforts said that federal government was following up on the plan to revamp the local vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria recently completed training on COVID-19 vaccine production technology by WHO in South Africa and work is currently going on at the BioVaccine company.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at working with two platforms, because of our population. We have to have these preparations made by identifying the vaccine production capacity that we can use to start off other production platform to be able to produce multiple types of vaccines.\n\n\u201cThere are many disease patterns in our country which we need to be able to take care of such as TB, malaria and other endemic diseases and these should have vaccines. So the research components have to be included.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that the country was working in collaboration with some research organisations outside the country for not only producing COVID-19 vaccine, but learning the capacity to produce any other type of vaccines that can be used to deal with some indigenous and tropical neglected diseases.",
