          "text": "Tasks Umahi on political solution for Kanu\u2019s freedom\n\nDisrupting poll\u2019ll cause Igbo huge set back\n\nLock down\u2019ll hurt Mrs Aguiyi Ironsi\u2019s Nov 5 burial\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe\n\nDisturbed by the negative implications of the seven-day sit-at-home directive of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, for the Anambra governorship election, the state, the South-East zone, and Nigeria, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has begged the separatist group to reconsider the stand.\n\nLast week, the IPOB vowed to observe a seven-day lock down in the South-East as from November 5 in support of its detained Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, unless he is released by the Federal Government on or before November 4.\n\nNoting that Anambra is the economic live wire of the South-East, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said any harm to the state will \u201ccreate untold disastrous chain reactions and catastrophe for the Igbo.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, Ohanaeze urged the Chairman, South-East Governors Forum and the Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. Dave Umahi, to convene an emergency meeting of Igbo stakeholders and Youth Leaders for the purpose of addressing the legitimacy crisis in the zone especially as it relates to Anambra State election and the political solution for the release of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nREAD ALSO: IPOB tackles Garba Shehu over comment on Nnamdi Kanu\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide pleads with the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to reconsider the 7 days\u2019 Sit at Home order in the South-East of Nigeria from November 5 to November 11.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the governorship election for Anambra State scheduled for November 6 to hold.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that Anambra State is the economic live wire of the South East with an impressive steady growth trajectory.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Anambra State showcases the best rural road network and rural community development in the South East if not in the entire Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnambra is home to the greatest number of small, medium and large scale industries in the South East.\n\n\u201cMost recently, Anambra has added a cargo airport to its resource base.\n\n\u201cAbove all, Onitsha is the largest market in West Africa. The implication of the above illustration is that Anambra State is the melting pot of Igbo traders and artisans.\n\n\u201cIt stands to reason that Anambra is the big Iroko tree that provides a shade for most Igbos. Apart from the shade, it also hosts the numerous birds that perch on the branches.\n\n\u201cTherefore any harm to the Iroko tree will create untold disastrous chain reactions and catastrophe for the Igbo.\n\n\u201cWhile pleading with the IPOB to rescind the Lock Down plan, Ohanaeze Ndigbo requests the Chairman, South East Governors Forum and the Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. Dave Umahi to convene an emergency meeting of Igbo stake holders and the Youth Leaders for the purpose of addressing the legitimacy crisis in the South East, especially as it relates to Anambra State election and the political solution for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cIt is important to point out that one of the causes of the crisis of confidence in the South-East is because of the yawning gap between the Youths and indeed the masses, on one side and the political leaders on the other.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the leadership of the various youth groups should not be excluded in any meeting aimed at resolving the current crises in Igbo Land. In other words, the Youths want to be fully convinced of our commitment to their plight.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo reiterates its solidarity with any group that protests the Igbo alienation in the project Nigeria with a caution for restraint, maturity and wisdom.\n\n\u201cIt is based on the foregoing that Ohanaeze adopts the philosophy of dialogue, negotiations in coalition with other concerned groups that comprise the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum led by Chief E K Clark.\n\n\u201cIt is also lamentable that the burial ceremony for the Afara Ukwu born Chief Mrs Victoria Aguiyi Ironsi, slated for November 5 in Umuahia, Abia State may be drastically affected by the prevailing Igbo social climate.\n\nGeneral JTU Aguiyi Ironsi represents so many things to the Igbo and we owe his soul a duty.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo urges the Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willy Obiano to convene a joint meeting of the Anambra State chapter of Ohanaeze Ndigbo led by Chief Emeka Udodeme and the Association of Town Union (ASATU) led by Barr. Titus Akpudo with a view to activating meetings in all the 181 towns of Anambra State.\n\nThe traditional rulers, Archbishops, Bishops and the Clergy are also requested to brace up in their roles as the cultural and spiritual leaders of society.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Professor George Obiozor, the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide is very perturbed that the serenity, tranquility and aggressive entrepreneurship for which the Igbo are known are gradually yielding to the unknown dark forces.\n\nHe is more perturbed when the Anambra ordeal is juxtaposed with the calibre of personages for which the State is known. Some of them include Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Dr. Alex. Ekwueme, Professor Chinua Achebe, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Professor Chike Obi, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Cardinal Francis Arinze, Professor Dora Akunyili, Dr. Chuba Okadigbo, Dr. Nwafor Orizu, Professor Keneth Dike, Peter Obi, Professor ABC Nwosu, Engr. Arthur Eze, Dr. Chris Ngige, Igwe Alfred Achebe, etc and numerous young and old billionaires.\n\n\u201cIn many respects, Anambra is the engine that propels the Igbo enterprise. As elders we should not fold our arms while the goat dies in the tether.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo is of the conviction that the disruption of the Anambra State election and the adverse consequences are a major setback to the Igbo civilization.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Sheikh Ahmed Gumi\n\n*He\u2019s a security threat to Nigeria \u2014 Ohanaeze\n\n*His advocacy for bandits uncalled for \u2014 Afenifere\n\n*Bandits\u2019re terrorists, no more, no less \u2014 MBF\n\n*Arrest Gumi now \u2014 CAN\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Dapo Akinrefon, Peter Duru, Luminous Jannamike & Ibrahim Hassan\n\nThe major ethnic groups, yesterday, gave renowned Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmed Gumi, hard knocks for opposing declaration of bandits as terrorists on the ground that doing so could cause holy war and worsen Nigeria\u2019s insecurity, a high price he said the country could not afford to pay.\n\nThose who criticised Gumi include the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF; the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere and the Middle Belt Forum, MBF.\n\nApex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, also joined the fray.\n\nSheikh Gumi had, on Tuesday, warned that foreign jihadists would come into Nigeria if the federal government declared bandits terrorists.\n\nIn a statement, Gumi urged clerics in the South to engage secession agitators, such as Sunday Igboho and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu of IPOB, the way he was engaging bandits in the North.\n\nHe had said: \u201cThe only helpful part that is against bandits is that no other than them are attracted to join them in the North-West because of its ethnic tinge and colouration.\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the moment they are termed terrorist \u2013 Islamic for that matter\u2014 the direct foreign Jihadist movements will set in, in force, and many teeming unemployed youths may find it palatable and attractive.\n\n\u201cShouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 plus AK-47 against a \u2018secular\u2019 immoral society where impunity reigns are the magnet for extremists and the down-trodden \u2013 the majority of our youth.\n\n\u201cThis will give criminality a spiritual cover and remove the stigma of discrediting them with such crimes since now they are fighting a \u2018jihad\u2019as they will claim.\n\n\u201cIn such a situation, does the larger society \u2013 as it is \u2014 have the moral high ground to fight back?\n\n\u201cThis is the most probable consequence, the price of which is not worth it.\n\n\u201cNothing stops the kinetic actions from going on without the controversy of semantics.\u2019\u2019\n\nGumi\u2019s comments challenge FG\u2019s authority \u2013 ACF\n\nBut reacting to Sheikh Gumi \u2018s assertion, the National Publicity Secretary of Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, said on phone yesterday: \u201cIt is left for the government to work out a way of managing Sheikh Gumi.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who is supposed to be an Islamic leader, but has moved into areas that have more to do with politics and insecurity than religion.\n\n\u201cHis last testament that Nigeria will cease to exist if the Federal Government declares bandits terrorists is very unfortunate.\n\n\u201cIt is a direct challenge on the legitimacy and authority of Buhari\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cIt is left for government to act to restore its legitimacy and authority.\u201d\n\nHis advocacy for bandits uncalled for \u2014 Afenifere\n\nIn its reaction, the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, faulted Gumi\u2019s advocacy for bandits, saying it is uncalled for.\n\nRising from a meeting yesterday, the National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said the group noted with serious concern the festering insecurity problems in the country.\n\n\u201cWe joined the National Assembly and several others who have been talking on the matter, that those who have been kidnapping and killing the people be declared terrorists and treated as such.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the attitude of the authorities on the issue of security in the country has not succeeded in stemming the increasing rate of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, bandits and terrorists kept getting emboldened to perpetrate their nefarious activities.\n\n\u201cIt is ironical that some individuals could be seeking clemency for terrorists who are maiming and killing people without any thoughts for the victims.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that whoever deodorizes or abets evil is culpable.\n\n\u201cAfenifere frowns on the consistent advocacy by Dr Ahmed Gumi for the government to pardon terrorists and even compensate them in various ways.\n\n\u201cIt is uncalled for. In the hope that those concerned will act fast and effectively.\n\n\u201cWe advise every community to be on the alert, with a view to ensuring that terrorists do not take over.\u201d\n\nBandits\u2019re terrorists, no more, no less \u2014 MBF\n\nOn its part, the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, said the claim by Sheik Gumi that declaring bandits terrorists would come at a price was unacceptable, describing it as a threat to dissuade the Federal Government from dealing decisively with the band of criminals.\n\nNational President of MBF, Dr. Bitrus Pogu, in a chat with Vanguard, yesterday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to live up to his primary responsibilities as enshrined in the constitution to ensure the protection of the lives of Nigerians aa well as ensure the welfare of the people.\n\nHis words: \u201cSome people assume too much. They seem to believe that these people (bandits) are supernatural beings, which is totally wrong.\n\n\u201cThey are just ordinary people. And by saying what he said, Sheik Gumi is just threatening the Federal Government not to deal with them decisively and we cannot accept that.\n\n\u201cPeople who have killed in cold blood, and attacked innocent communities in their sleep should not be allowed to go free.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, people who can shoot down aircraft, who would blow railway lines, who would do all sorts of things more than even Boko Haram are terrorists by any definition.\n\n\u201cNobody should be frightened by what Gumi said. Nigeria can deal with these terrorists because our military has the capacity.\n\n\u201cWhat I believe is happening is that there is no political will to dislodge these groups.\n\n\u201cGoing by what the President said in 2014 to then President Goodluck Jonathan that he was killing his people, they are being mild toward these criminals and the time has come for President Buhari to be the statesman that he is and the leader of the country.\n\n\u201cHe should defend the constitution which says his primary objective of governance is the security and welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cHe has to provide that security by dealing with these criminals that are occupying unguarded and unoccupied spaces and killing and terrorizing our people.\n\n\u201cSo they should be called by the name they deserve, which is terrorists and should be dealt with as terrorists.\u201d\n\nGumi\u2019s a security threat to Nigeria \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nAlso speaking, the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, said with his comments and roles in the polity, Sheikh Gumi remained a threat to Nigeria and should be treated as such.\n\nH e said: \u2018\u2019I describe the man as a security threat to Nigeria. He is an Islamic cleric. To that extent, he is supposed to preach peace but his role in social life is completely at variance with what he preaches.\n\n\u201cSuch people are more of security threat to the country, a green snake in green grass and a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\n\n\u2018\u2019For one to lead, relate or communicate with a group, that person must be a member of that group. That is the implication.\n\n\u201cIf he is claiming to be a communicator or mediator of that group, one of the conditions to play that role is, he must be one of them.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Nigerian government should hold him for who he is.\u2019\u2019\n\nArrest Gumi now, CAN tells FG\n\nAlso reacting yesterday, the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, challenged the Federal Government to immediately arrest the controversial cleric.\n\nThe umbrella Christian body told Vanguard that security agencies should also swing into action by investigating the claim made by the Muslim scholar that declaring bandits as terrorists by the government would come with a price.\n\nCAN\u2019s Director of National Issues and Social Welfare, Bishop Stephen Adegbite, said: \u201cThe Federal Government appears to be treating Sheikh Ahmed Gumi with kid gloves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and we are worried, disappointed, and pained that he would make such a bold statement unchallenged.\n\n\u201cBut the Church will no longer keep silent. Enough is enough. We will take him up word-for-word, henceforth.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should do the needful and arrest him. Is Gumi the owner of Nigeria?\n\n\u201cWhat effrontery has he to challenge the verdict of the people that the bandits are the enemies seeking to destroy our nation?\n\n\u201cSomeone must call him to order. He must stop issuing threats to Nigerians and Nigeria. Gumi should be behind bars.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He also required regular dialysis to keep him alive.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Director of Corporate Affairs of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, Mr. Tunde Olofintila, the patient who came entirely on his own to the Hospital on April 12, 2021, became critically ill in February 2021 \u2013 almost at the point of death.\n\nWhen the patient got to ABUAD Multi-System Hospital in April, he was impressed with the way he was attended to after which he proceeded to make enquiries about kidney transplantation in ABUAD Hospital which commenced operation about three-and-half years ago.\n\nConvinced that his case would be resolved in ABUAD Multi-System Hospital, he started looking for kidney donors, but he was not immediately lucky to get one.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen I brought the first prospective donor, he was found not to be fit to donate. I then brought in the second prospective donor. Again, he was found not to be fit. Then I brought in a third, my brother-in-law (name withheld)\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cAfter all the screenings, the third prospect was found to be fit. We were all happy and convinced that we were getting a solution to the problem. It was then the series of counselling session for both of us, the donor and recipient, began. We were severally counselled\u201d.\n\nAccording to Dr. Stephen Olawale Oguntola, the Coordinator of the Transplant Programme and Lead Nephrologist with the ABUAD Multi-System Hospital, \u201cthe transplant was done simultaneously on Wednesday, October 13, using a dedicated twin-transplant theatre right here in this Hospital, thus making it the first successful kidney transplant in Ekiti/Ondo axis of the country\u201d.\n\nOguntola added: \u201cthe kidney function started improving right inside the theatre with the new kidney producing 2.3 litres of urine before the end of surgery which lasted for 5 hours, 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cThereafter, the kidney function has continued to make a sustained improvement. We are very happy about the way both the donor and recipient have responded to the procedure. Both of them are in very high spirits. In fact, the donor was discharged on October 20 and with the look of things, the recipient will be discharged in a couple of days to start his normal life after the transplant\u201d.\n\nThe Consultant Nephrologist thereafter called on members of the public to avail themselves of the facilities and equipment available in ABUAD Multi-System Hospital, stressing that \u201cABUAD is an enclave of endless possibilities\u201d\n\nNarrating his experience, the lucky patient who had been to the Indian Embassy thrice but could not get a visa because of Covid-19, was full of gratitude for the Founder& Chancellor of Afe Babalola University, Aare Afe Babalola, SAN, and the Medical team that attended to him.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen I got here for the first time, I was surprised that a lawyer could put a gigantic Hospital like this in place. At some point, I asked myself how a lawyer could think of this type of thing for humanity. This has endeared me to him the more. But for him, I would have died.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer Senate president, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has said despite the fact that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has zoned its national chairmanship to the North Central, it did not prevent any qualified aspirant from any zone from contesting the presidency in 2023.\n\nSpeaking on a national television programme monitored in Lagos, yesterday, the former Kwara State governor debunked speculations that the party would zone its presidency to the south since it zoned its national chairmanship to the north.\n\nHe said the leadership of the party had at different fora reiterated its commitment to throwing open the contest for the 2023 presidential ticket to all zones as long as it gets the best candidate from the process.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of zoning, the party has made it very clear in all our meetings that even though we have zoned the position of party offices, it does not preclude anybody that has any presidential ambition. Most of our leaders have said that, and we have said that at our NEC, and all the possible meetings, that even though we have taken the chairmanship of the party to the North Central, it does not preclude anyone from contesting. What we are looking for is the best candidate that would win the election.\u201d\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nSaraki said the party was undaunted by the defection of three of its governors (Ebonyi, Zamfara and Cross River), federal and state legislators, saying that such actions were expected. He, however, said the PDP will receive a former governor into its fold this week, and that Nigerians should not be surprise if bigwigs from the All Progressives Congress (APC) defect to the PDP when the 2023 elections draws closer.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that we are haemorrhaging members because I had said it a couple of times that there were certain governors that we knew were going to leave. In fact, they had left, but we were just waiting for their final exit, so we were not surprised. We have got some big wigs that will be coming to our party this week, there is a former governor that would join us and you should know that when leaders in the ruling party want to defect, they don\u2019t defect early. I think Nigerians should not be surprised when they begin to see some defections from the ruling party.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, the number of states that APC has now is almost the same as what we had in the PDP, and the concern that people are defecting should not matter. More importantly, the country is in a different place now and Nigerians have seen what the ruling party has to offer. We all have differences in our party and we are resolving because this is the only alternative party for Nigerians that would provide leadership, that is why we in the PDP believe that the interest of Nigerians should supersede our individual interests. We have been able to resolve our differences across the states so that we can convince Nigerians that we are able to take over the leadership of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if he will contest for the presidency in 2023, he said it was too early for anyone to declare such ambition even as he debunked speculations that if he contested and lost, he would leave the PDP.\n\n\u201cBecause some people defected from the PDP to APC does not mean that I would defect. You have to look at my antecedents in 2019 and you will see that the fact that I didn\u2019t win elections didn\u2019t make me defect, so I can\u2019t see why that would come up. Where we are now is not about anyone\u2019s personal ambition, it is about how we can work to make this country better. What is important for us is to build a strong party and that was why I took up the responsibility of leading the reconciliation committee because there was concern that the party was losing a lot of steam. We can\u2019t talk about our ambition without a strong party and in due time I will answer the question of whether I will contest or not.\u201d\n\nOn the court case brought against the PDP by its former national chairman, Uche Secondus, he said: \u201cWe have a court case involving him because he is still our chairman, but we are looking beyond that and looking at our congress. Do we look like a party that is resolving its issues and trying to move forward to its convention to elect new leaders? Today, we are not meeting to resolve state congresses because we have been able to move forward. We cannot afford to get it wrong in 2023 and PDP is in a better position to give credible leadership.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has expressed hope that the recently launched eNaira would buoy and reposition Nigeria\u2019s economy to attract investors.\n\nHe also said the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Bank Verification Number (BVN), and National Identification Number (NIN) initiatives have reinforced his administration\u2019s efforts in tackling corruption.\n\nSpeaking at the fifth edition of Future Investment Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Buhari assured that his administration would encourage public and private initiatives that increases investments in health, education, capacity building, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication, climate change and food security.\n\n\u201ce-Naira, the electronic version of our national currency, which puts us on track to become the first African country to introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency was launched on October 25th, 2021. We believe this and many other reforms, will help us increase the number of people participating in the banking sector, make for a more efficient financial sector and help us tackle illicit flow of funds. To further strengthen our anti-corruption drive, increase accountability and transparency, we have centralised government funds through a Treasury Single Account, and ensuring that all Nigerians with a bank account use a unique Bank Verification Number (BVN). These initiatives, coupled with our nationwide National Identification Number (NIN) exercise, reinforce our efforts to tackle corruption and fraud. We believe that this should give investors a lot of comfort.\u201d\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe president, who described the summit as a credible forum for interaction between public and private sectors, to explore ways of advancing economic growth, development and global prosperity, said Nigeria\u2019s diversification efforts have continued to yield results, particularly in agriculture.\n\n\u201cWe introduced policies that supported investments in agriculture and food processing. We provided loans and technical support to small holder farmers, through the Anchor Borrowers Programme. As a result, Nigeria today has over 40 rice mills from less than 10 in 2014. Nigeria also has over 46 active fertiliser blending plants from less than 5 in 2014.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in agriculture, we have reformed the process of obtaining inputs such as fertiliser and seeds. We have several million hectares of available arable land and have embarked on the creation of Special Agriculture Processing Zones across the country. These initiatives we believe will make it easier for investors in agriculture,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari told the gathering of world leaders, global investors and asset managers that the oil sector was already undergoing a reform that would make it more attractive and inclusive.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago, I signed the Petroleum Industry Act. The Act will serve as a catalyst to liberalise our petroleum sector. It has introduced a number of incentives such as tax holidays, 100 percent ownership, zero interest loans and easy transfer of funds. In addition, we have highly skilled in-country workforce and a large domestic market. In mining, we have also made several opportunities available for investors. Nigeria is a country rich in minerals from gold, iron ore, tin, zinc, cobalt, lithium, limestone, phosphate, bitumen and many others. We have made the licensing process easier and also made extensive investments in rail and transportation.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure investments represent significant potential for investors in Nigeria. We have opportunities in seaports, rail, toll roads, real estate, renewable energy and many others. We have created several institutions that are available to co-invest with you in Nigeria. We have the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and more recently, I approved the creation of Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria. These institutions are run as independent world class institutions to make investments in the country and are available to co-invest with you.\u201d\n\nBuhari urged more interest in infrastructure such as healthcare and education, which \u201cpresent enormous opportunities for investors in a country our size.\u201d\n\nThe president also drew attention of world leaders to the devastating effect of climate change on livelihoods of people around the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cAs we strive to build resilience towards a sustainable economy in our various countries, let us not forget the negative impact of climate change on our efforts to achieve this goal. Nigeria and many countries in Africa, are already facing the challenges posed by climate change. Climate change has triggered conflicts, food insecurity, irregular youth migration, rising level of sea waters, drought and desertification, as well as the drying-up of the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cIn the Lake Chad Basin region, where Boko Haram insurgency continues to undermine the peace, security and development of the region, climate change is largely responsible for the drying up of the Lake Chad which has shrunk by more than 85 per cent its original size. The diminishing size of the lake is at the root of the loss of millions of livelihoods, displacement of inhabitants and radicalisation of teeming youths in the region who are recruited to serve as foot soldiers in the insurgency.\n\n\u201cIn order to redress this situation and restore the lost fortunes of the Lake Chad Basin region, strong public-private partnership through massive investments will be needed to recharge the waters of Lake Chad. I am confident that this forum will rise to the challenge in the interest of durable peace and sustainable development of our region.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria needs $2.7bn to improve products supply, distribution infrastructure\n\n\u2022Projects petroleum products demand to grow to 17.3m MT by 2025\n\nPeter Uzoho\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said investment opportunities worth nearly $3.097 billion currently exist in the country\u2019s condensate refineries\u2019 space. Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated this yesterday in Lagos in his keynote address at the 15th Oil Trading and Logistics (OTL) Africa Downstream Week.\n\nKyari said between $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion were required by the corporation to improve the supply and distribution of petroleum products, revamp Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) infrastructure, and build Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) plants in the country.\n\nKyari, who was represented at the event by the Group Executive Director, Downstream, NNPC, Mr. Adetunji Adeyemi, projected that Nigeria\u2019s petroleum product demand would grow to 17.3 million metric tons by 2025, up from the 15.1 million MT in 2020.\n\nThe theme of the conference was, \u201cDownstream in Transition: Getting Set.\u201d\n\nKyari added that the country would need a refining capacity of about 1.52 million barrels per stream day (MBPSD) to meet its petrol requirement in the next four years.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs Nigeria\u2019s demand for petroleum products is expected to grow from 15.1 million MT in 2020 to 17.3 million MT by 2025, the country needs a refining capacity of about 1.52 million barrels per stream day (MBPSD), to meet its PMS requirement in the next four years.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries\u2019 445,000 BPSD and Dangote Refinery\u2019s 650,000 BPSD running at 60 per cent and nameplate capacity, respectively, would supply 76 per cent of that requirement, leaving a shortfall of about 17 million litres of PMS daily.\n\n\u201cNNPC is adding 215,000 BPSD of refining capacity through private sector driven co-location at the existing facilities in PHRC and WRPC, respectively. Modular refineries are also adding capacities, such as the 5,000 BPSD Waltersmith refinery, which will be upgraded to 50,000 BPSD.\n\n\u201cAdditional 250,000 BSPD is expected to come from the Condensate Refineries through the private sector partnership. The co-location and condensate refineries will close the PMS supply-demand gap and create positive returns to the investors.\n\n\u201cAbout $3.097 billion investment opportunities exist in condensate refineries while $1.6 \u2013 $2.7 billion is required by NNPC to improve the supply and distribution petroleum of products, revamp LPG infrastructure and build CNG plants.\u201d\n\nKyari said the demand for natural gas could grow about four times over the next decade, increasing from 4.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in 2020 to between 10 \u2013 23 bcf/d in 2030.\n\nHe said currently, supply to the domestic market was about 8bcf/d to power, 0.77 bcf/d to industries, and about 54 bcf/d was flared, while 3.2 bcf/d was for export gas through the LNG and the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP).\n\nAccording to him, achieving this growth in demand would be occasioned by increasing the dispatchable capacity of existing power in line with the Presidential Power Initiative, which is less than 1.4 bcf/d).\n\nHe added that the growth would be achieved through assuring delivery of major fertiliser projects (Dangote, Brass) 5 bcf/d), and enabling industrial demand for natural gas in the northern axis of the country (1.2 bcf/d).\n\nOn the global oil market outlook, Kyari said, \u201cSome $10.4 trillion global stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rebound in consumers\u2019 spending while incentives for long-term investments in hydrocarbon has waned.\u201d\n\nHe stated that hydrocarbon would continue to be relevant in the global energy mix for the next two decades, quoting the recent data by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nAccording to the data, the world oil demand was expected to rise from a pandemic stricken 90.6 million bpd in 2020 to 108.2 million bpd in 2045, thereby accounting for 28 per cent of global energy needs. The OPEC data further stated that the rise in demand would be driven by growth in world population, which is set to expand to 9.5 billion by 2045, and the huge potential for expanding access to modern energy services for the under-served.\n\n\u201cHowever, $11.8 trillion in oil-related investments will be required mostly in the US upstream to meet the market needs,\u201d Kyari noted.\n\nOn the issue of downstream in transition, the NNPC boss noted that the Nigerian oil and gas industry has been in transition prior to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) passage in response to the global energy transition and decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nKyari maintained that it would be difficult to discuss the transition in the downstream sub-sector in isolation from the overall evolution that was happening in the industry.

          "text": "\u2022Appeals to judges, lawyers not to destroy judiciary\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nChief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, has once again brought to the fore the indiscriminate issuance of injunctive orders by courts across the country, warning that such acts continue to erode public confidence in the country\u2019s judiciary. Muhammad recalled that the reckless granting of ex parte orders reached a worrisome height recently, and he had to warn some judges to desist from such conduct.\n\nMuhammad made the assertions yesterday during the swearing in ceremony for Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf as the substantive Chief Judge (CJ) of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, which held at the Supreme Court complex, Abuja.\n\nThe CJN took a swipe at the judges and lawyers who went about forum shopping, cautioning that their actions could bring down not only the judiciary, but also the entire nation.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAn occasion like this may be auspicious for self-assessment. It is by co-incidence that this event comes at a time the Nigerian Bar Association is holding its 61st Annual General Conference tagged: \u2018Taking The Lead\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe legal profession should, indeed, take the lead in all human affairs. However, the lead is at a price. We cannot take the lead when our courts issue ex-parte orders recklessly.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take the lead when many litigants with support of their counsel engage in forum shopping. We cannot take the lead when counsels file a case before a court that they know lacks jurisdiction and the judge proceeds to hear the case. We cannot take the lead when counsel files frivolous cases in our courts just for nuisance value or to buy time.\u201d\n\nTo stem the tide, the CJN stated that the judiciary must not only do self-assessment, but also needed self-cleansing, adding that all hands must be on deck from both the Bar and the Bench to rid the legal profession of bad eggs.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe legal profession is the building under which we are sheltered. If we fold our hands and watch others destroy it or we participate in the destruction, it will collapse on us. We will then have no roof over our heads. May God forbid!\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating Justice Baba-Yusuf on his appointment, the CJN prayed to God to guide, protect and assist him in the discharge of his duty as head of court.\n\nHe told Baba-Yusuf that as head of court, his burden had become heavier.\n\n\u201cYou should, therefore, take charge and ensure that you are just and fair to your brother judges, the management, staff, and, most importantly, to the litigants,\u201d the CJN counselled the new FCT Chief Judge.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Politicians Still Influencing Judges to Use Court against Democracy",
          "text": "Alexander Enumah\n\nWeeks after the Chief Justice of Nigeria (NJC), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, who was angered by conflicting orders from courts of coordinate jurisdictions, issued a stern warning to judges on the need to act right in nation\u2019s interest, it appears an end is not in sight yet to the impunity of some of the judges and justices in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, the unsavoury dispositions of some of the justices and judges to democratic concerns, have continued to decimate the gains of the nation\u2019s 23 years of unbroken civil rule. Even when they know full well they lack the jurisdiction to entertain the matters, they still go ahead to hear and pronounce ruling, which becomes an albatross on the neck of the party it was obtained against.\n\nThe submission of a majority of the people is that if the trend persisted, the fourth republic, which prides itself as the longest in the history of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, might come to an abrupt end going by the recent activities of desperate politicians and their cohorts in the judiciary.\n\nOne of the recent indicators to this unending judicial rascality could be located in how some individuals had rushed to court to stop the forthcoming national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the manner the courts have been encouraging the resort to destabilisation.\n\nNational Convention Organising Committee (NCOC) of the PDP raised the alarm about a suit filed at the Kaduna High Court, ostensibly to derail the October 30 and 31 national convention and advised party members to be wary of such disgruntled and misguided members of the party.\n\nAlthough details of the suit have remained sketchy, it was allegedly filed by an aide to a former Vice President, Namadi Sambo. But the aide, said to be close to Secondus, has however denied having anything to do with the suit.\n\nSecretary of the NCOC and Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said, \u201cNotwithstanding their right to approach a court of competent jurisdiction to air their grievances, we maintain that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP has acted in good faith in fixing our convention for October 30 and 31. It is not meant to witch-hunt anyone or to truncate anyone\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all members and supporters of the PDP to ignore this distraction as we prepare to host a convention that will send a clear signal to Nigerians that the PDP is the only party that has the will and the might to rescue Nigeria from the catastrophe that we have been enduring for the past six years.\u201d\n\nBut Secondus had through his lawyer, Mr Tayo Oyetiba, SAN, asked the PDP to shelve the planned convention slated for October 30 and 31, pending the determination of Secondus\u2019 appeal.\n\nThe appeal with the number CA/PH/341/2021, is seeking to quash his suspension and applied for \u201cAn order of injunction restraining the Peoples Democratic Party, the 6 respondent herein, whether by itself, its officers, servants, agents and or representatives from holding or conducting its National Convention scheduled for 30th and 31st October 2021 or any other date, pending the hearing and final determination of this appeal.\u201d\n\nThe hearing of the appeal as well as the motion for interlocutory injunction comes up today, Tuesday, October 26, at the Port Harcourt Division of the Court of Appeal.\n\nWhether the appellate court would accede to the demand or not is another, particularly, taking into consideration the recent position of appellate court justices with respect to exparte granted by High Court judges.\n\nIt is worthy of mention that the appellate court and even the Supreme Court had descended heavily on the High Court judges particularly, in the Anambra governorship suits.\n\nJustice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Court of Appeal had in a ruling on August 2, in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), governorship tussle, called for sanction against two judges in the Jigawa and Imo States High Court for what she described as professional misconduct. She also called for sanctions for lawyers, who aided politicians in the filing of all such applications that had brought the court to ridicule.\n\nSimilarly, Justice Hamma Zamani of the Kano Division of the Court of Appeal had on August 10 in his judgment, set aside the judgment of a Jigawa State High Court, which had earlier declared Jude Okeke and Chukwuma Umeoji as the APGA national chairman and governorship candidate respectively.\n\nThe appellate court claimed that the trial court erred by entertaining a suit wherein it lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, also in a judgment on October 14, 2021, upheld the decision of Justice Zamani of the Kano division of the Appeal Court for nullifying the judgment of the High Court for want of jurisdiction.\n\nThe apex court in a unanimous judgment held that the internal issue of political parties\u2019 was outside the jurisdiction of courts and consequently upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which resolved the leadership tussle in APGA in favour of Victor Oye and also upheld the primary election conducted by his leadership, which produced Professor Chukwuma Soludo as APGA\u2019s governorship candidate for the November 6 governorship election.\n\nSoludo was nominated candidate of APGA in the forthcoming governorship poll by the Oye faction and his nomination was accepted by INEC. But Okeke challenged the authenticity of the Oye leadership at a Federal High Court in Jigawa State, where judgment was given in his favour.\n\nHowever, the Jigawa Judgment was set aside by the Appeal Court leading him to proceed to the apex court to upturn the appellate court\u2019s decision.\n\nThe seven member panel of the apex court in the judgment delivered by Justice Mary Odili, held that it was clear that the appellant engaged in abuse of judicial process, because the subject matter of the suit was not justiciable as it bordered on the internal matters of a political party.\n\nWhile the panel berated lawyers to the appellant for engaging in unethical conduct by filing such suit in the first place, it blamed the Jigawa High Court judge for accepting to hear the suit that was outside his jurisdiction. The panel went on to slam a fine of N1 million against the appellant for abuse of court process.\n\nAside the judges, the umbrella body for lawyers, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), had also condemned the development and promised to deal with lawyers engaging in acts capable of bringing the judiciary to disrepute.\n\nA statement by its National President in September, Mr. Olumide Akpata, described as unfortunate, the recurring trend of contradictory court orders especially amongst courts of coordinate jurisdiction. He cited the recent cases involving the Anambra State forthcoming election and the PDP leadership crisis, which according to him \u201cevokes memories of those eerie and unwanted dark days.\n\n\u201cWhile the NBA will continue to stay away from the political ramifications and machinations involved in these matters, it is self-evident that these developments in our courts are antithetical to the actualisation of the just society and independent judiciary that we all aspire to, and they run contrary to everything we teach and hold dear as a profession.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a swirling belief that of the three judges under probe, one or two were involved in the PDP leadership crisis suit. While Justice O. Gbasam of a High Court of Rivers State, had on August 23, 2021 issued an order of interim injunction restraining Secondus from carrying on as Chairman of the PDP, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office, Justice Nusirat Umar of the Kebbi State High Court, issued another order on Secondus to return to his position as the National Chairman on August 26.\n\nThe judge made the order while delivering ruling in a suit marked KB/AC/M. 170/2021, filed by three concerned members of the party, Yahaya Usman, Abubakar mohammed and Bashar Suleman.\n\nJustice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affavidit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\nBut before Secondus could carry out the order, Justice Edem Kooffreh of a Cross River State High Court on August 28, restrained him from resuming.\n\nThe amusing thing about all the orders is that they were not only issued by courts of coordinate jurisdiction, but were all based on exparte applications.\n\nAttempt to rid the judiciary of bad eggs started, when the National Judicial Council (NJC) under the chairmanship of the CJN, constituted an investigative panel to probe the three High Court judges over their alleged indiscriminate issuance of court orders, an act perceived as detrimental to the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nA statement by the Director of Information, NJC, Mr Soji Oye, read, \u201cThe National Judicial Council under the Chairmanship of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice I. T. Muhammad, at its 95th Meeting held on September 15 and 16, 2021, in line with the principles of fair hearing, has directed the three Judges of coordinate jurisdiction, who granted Exparte Orders over the same case with the same subject matter to appear before a special Investigation Committee constituted by the Council in order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for such act\u201d.\n\nAlthough, the names of the judges and the jurisdiction they operated were not made public, they were however believed to be amongst the six jurisdictions of the High Court whose heads were summoned by the CJN in August, to explain the rationale behind the issuance of conflicting others by judges in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe letter dated August 30, read in part: \u201cMy attention has been drawn to media reports to the effect that some Courts of coordinate jurisdiction were granting conflicting Exparte Orders on the same subject matter.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient for me to invite you for a detailed briefing on the development. This is even more compelling having regard to earlier NJC Warning to judicial officers on the need to be circumspect in granting Ex-parte applications\u201d.\n\nFrom the tone of the letter, it was obvious that the CJN was not only worried but also bitter over the development, which sources around the CJN noted was a huge embarrassment tothe Nigerian judiciary and the country at large.\n\nSpeaking on the ongoing probe of the three judges on Monday in Abuja, an official of the NJC, who did not want his name mentioned, said the probe was ongoing and once the committee concluded its job, which he believed was in no distant time, the council would look into it and take critical decisions to serve as a warning to others if the said judges were guilty of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe committee is still sitting, you know they have to give them fair hearing, they will bring their lawyers to defend them, afterwards the committee will now recommend them to the plenary of the NJC. It is the NEC meeting that will determine, whatever the plenary agrees is the final decision,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it is difficult to comprehend what would make a judge assume jurisdiction in a case he knew he lacked any, the level of condemnation and fines against politicians and their lawyers by the appellate and Supreme Courts, have yet to abate the obnoxious situation in the judiciary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022President says with digital currency, GDP will rise by $29bn in 10 years\n\n\u2022Nigeria first country to launch electronic money in Africa\n\n\u2022Emefiele: new intervention will jumpstart productive base of economy \u2022Reiterates Nigeria cannot fritter FX on cheap imports, currency speculators\n\nDeji Elumoye, James Emejo and Sonia Mayomi in Abuja\n\nIn line with efforts to enhance the payment system and boost transactions, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday launched the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), also known as eNaira, in Abuja. This was as Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, unveiled a new financial instrument tagged, \u201cThe 100 for 100 PPP \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity,\u201d meant to stimulate activities in private sector companies in the country that would be selected.\n\nBuhari said during the launch of the digital currency that with the introduction of eNaira, the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was projected to rise by $29 billion in the next 10 years. He stressed that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nThe president assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC. He disclosed that the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began in 2017.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dWork intensified over the past several months with several brainstorming exercises, deployment of technical partners and advisers, collaboration with the Ministries of Communication and Digital Economy and its sister agencies like the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), integration of banking software across the country and painstaking tests to ensure the robustness, safety and scalability of the CBDC System.\u201d\n\nThe president also explained why he supported the initiative, saying in recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline.\n\nThe decline was exacerbated by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new digital economy, stressed.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that central banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of \u2018private currencies\u2019 that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dIn response to these developments, an overwhelming majority of central banks across the world have started to consider issuing digital currencies in order to cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payment.\n\n\u201cA handful of countries, including China, Bahamas, and Cambodia, have already issued their own CBDCs. A 2021 survey of central banks around the world by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that almost 90 per cent are actively researching the potential for CBDCs, 60 per cent were experimenting with the technology, and 14 per cent were deploying pilot projects.\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of eNaira on the economy as a whole.\n\n\u201dIt is on the basis of this that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sought and received my approval to explore issuing Nigeria\u2019s own Central Bank Digital Currency, named the eNaira.\u201d\n\nThe president also said CBN\u2019s reputation as a leading innovator, \u201cin the form of money they produce, and in the payment services they deploy for efficient transactions,\u201d inspired him to approve eNaira.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s apex bank had invested heavily in creating a payment system that was ranked in the top 10 in the world and, certainly, the best in Africa.\n\nBuhari explained, \u201cThis payment system now provides high-value and time-critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey have also supported several private-sector initiatives to improve the existing payments landscape, and in turn, have created some of the world\u2019s leading payment service providers today.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said with the new initiative, CBN would advertise, screen, scrutinise and financially support 100 targeted private sector companies in 100 days, beginning from November 1. Under the initiative, the CBN governor said, a new set of 100 companies would be rolled out every 100 days and their names would be published in the national dailies for Nigerians to see and confirm.\n\nHe said the new initiative would be managed by the CBN Development Finance Department, under his direct supervision.\n\nThe CBN governor pointed out that the initiative would be the best and most sustainable way to strengthen the value of the naira, insisting that what the country requires is production and more production.\n\nEmefiele explained, \u201cWorking through banks, the financial instrument will be available to their customers in critical areas to boost the production and productivity, and to immediately transform and jumpstart the productive base of the economy.\n\n\u201cAfter these 100 projects by companies in the first 100 days from November 1, we will take the next 100 companies/projects for another 100 days beginning February 1, 2022, and then another 100 companies for another 100 days beginning from May 1, 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said the instrument was part of measures to reverse the country\u2019s overreliance on imports, adding that the country cannot afford to waste its reserves on cheap imports and currency speculators.\n\nEmefiele also assured that there was no cause for alarm over foreign exchange (FX) availability in the country, pointing out that the country\u2019s FX reserves are strong and, \u201cindeed, getting stronger by the day, crossing the $40 billion mark, and is one of the highest in Africa \u2013 and growing.\u201d\n\nOn the bank\u2019s latest intervention to support companies, the CBN governor said, \u201cWe believe that if we target and support the right companies and projects, we will see a significant, measurable and verifiable increase in local production and productivity, reduction in certain imports, increase in non-oil exports, and improvements in the FX-generating capacity of the economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated that the current challenges with the country\u2019s exchange rate started since the advent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, and the introduction of the Second Tier Foreign Exchange (SFEM) market. He said the local currency had been on a one-way free fall from parity to the US Dollar in 1984 to over N410/USD today.\n\nHe said about 35 years later, Nigeria had not been able to achieve the many promises and objectives of that programme.\n\n\u201cInstead, what we have seen is widespread import dependency, which have wiped out most of our production and manufacturing bases and exported all our jobs in the process,\u201d he said.\n\nEmefiele queried, \u201cWhat has happened to the massive textile factories across our nation, such that we import almost all cotton products when we are rich in cotton?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our vehicle assembly plants across the nation such that we import most vehicles and have become a massive dumping ground for dying second-hand vehicles?\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to our rubber plantations through which we made the best tyres and rubber products in the world? What has happened to our groundnut pyramids? What has happened to our cocoa farms? What has happened to our palm oil mills?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must return to massive home-made production; we must get our people working again. We must create the economic environment for massive domestic production and significant non-oil exports.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor said the country must return to an employment-led growth anchored on productivity and rewarding producers of local goods, services, innovation and new technologies.\n\n\u201cIf you consume cheap imports and export our jobs, we will make you pay dearly; but if you produce locally \u2013 with little or no foreign inputs beyond machinery \u2013 we will support you, and the markets will reward you abundantly.\u201d\n\nHe said the 100 PPP policy was in addition to other policies and interventions of the CBN meant to support the economy, especially, through the trying times of COVID-19.\n\nEmefiele said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017. He said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and the fast growing payment platforms.\n\nCBN decided to implement its own CBDC and to name the digital currency eNaira, with the expectation that the innovation would make significant positive difference to Nigeria and Nigerians, he stated.\n\nEmefiele said the eNaira would support a resilient payment ecosystem, encourage rapid financial inclusion, reduce the cost of processing cash, enable direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens and increase revenue and tax collection.\n\nHe said eNaira would also facilitate diaspora remittances, reduce the cost of financial transactions, and improve the efficiency of payments.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same naira with far more possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira \u2013 like the physical naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at one naira to one eNaira.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said in a bid to further de-risk the process, CBN had given careful consideration to the entire payment and financial architecture and designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems. He said the bank had also implemented safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe CBN boss added that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nHe said since the eNaira platform went live, there had been overwhelming interest and encouraging response from Nigerians and others across the world, with over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\nAccording to him, 33 banks are fully integrated and live on the platform while N500 million had been successfully minted by the central bank, including N200 million, which had been issued to financial institutions.\n\nEmefiele said over 2,000 customers have been on-boarded while120 merchants had successfully registered on the eNaira platform.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, customers who download the eNaira Speed Wallet App will be able to perform the following: Onboard and create their wallet, fund their eNaira wallet from their bank account, transfer eNaira from their wallet to another wallet, and make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations.\u201d\n\nEmefiele acknowledged there was a continuing debate on the true value of the naira, adding, \u201crather than worry today on the direction of the exchange rate, let us take a step back and analyse how we got here, in the first place.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN staff that worked tirelessly to deliver on the central bank\u2019s numerous projects.\n\nSpeaking further in an interview with THISDAY, Emefiele said, \u201cWe would not embark on a project where we have not really dimensioned the risks; you identify risks and you now measure the risks and then we think about how to manage the risks and we have looked at it.\n\n\u201cThere is no need, absolutely no reason for anybody to be afraid of the risk of even hacking your account and the rest of that.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis morning I set up my account and my account is operating very well. I talked about the BVN; the BVN is one of the best payment systems infrastructure that we have put in place and I can assure you that with all that has been done, you cannot hack into it.\n\n\u201cIf somebody hacks into yours, it will be because you were reckless in handling your information but not that the system failed.\u201d\n\nHe described eNaira as an extension of the payment system in Nigeria, which would enhance payments outside the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou can make payment for goods and services rendered to somebody who even resides outside the country as long as he is willing to accept Naira.\n\n\u201cWe will see eventually that what it does is that your reliance on third currency would be reduced by embracing eNaira. That is one area that I am looking forward to, how this would help our country.\u201d\n\nCBN Waives Charges on eNaira Transactions for 90 Days\n\nCBN yesterday said charges for transactions that originate from its eNaira platform would be free from charges for the first 90 days, commencing October 25. The bank noted that it would, thereafter, revert to applicable charges as outlined in the Guide to Charges by Banks, Other Financial and Non-bank Financial Institutions.\n\nThis was revealed in a circular on the Regulatory Guidelines on the eNaira, dated October 25, 2021, which was signed by the apex bank\u2019s Director, Financial Policy and Regulations Department, Chibuzo Efobi, and addressed to all stakeholders.\n\nCBN restated in the circular that the digital currency would complement cash as a less costly, more efficient, generally accepted, safe and trusted means of payment and store of value.\n\nIt added that the eNaira would also improve monetary policy effectiveness, enhance government\u2019s capacity to deoy targeted social interventions, provide alternative less costly channels for collection of government revenue and boost remittances through formal channels.\n\nAccording to the apex bank, the guidelines further seek to provide simplicity in the operation of the eNaira, encourage general acceptability and use, promote low cost of transactions, drive financial inclusion, while minimising inherent risks of disintermediation or any negative impact of the system.\n\nThe eNaira wallet is required to access, use and hold eNaira, which will be exchangeable for other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC).\n\nThe CBN added that the AML/CFT checks for fraud prevention and detection would apply on the eNaira platform.\n\nHence, financial institutions are required to comply with the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 (as amended), the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 (as amended) and all subsisting anti-money laundering laws and regulations as may be issued by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUnder the new system, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) may receive revenue in eNaira; and make payments in same form.\n\nIt added that users of the eNaira would be introduced to a tiered structure with transaction and balance limits.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

BRING ABBA KYARI BACK!\"\n\nAnd in response to Agwaramgbo, one Bond Chris Ohuche said, \"So no other police officer is capable? Alright, why not ask for the disbandment of the entire police force since it can't perform without one man?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the probe panel set up to investigate Kyari has since August submitted a compromised report.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that the panel found Kyari guilty of some infractions after its investigation but recommended that Kyari should be demoted and not dismissed. See Also Police Abba Kyari Asked Me To Pay The Proceed Of Hotel Owned By Kidnap Kingpin Into My Bank Account \u2014 Police Lawyer\n\nTop sources in the Nigeria Police Force had told SaharaReporters that the plot by the police authorities to hand Kyari a demotion was to frustrate his much anticipated extradition to the United States.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that the probe panel set up by the IGP after three weeks of dilly-dallying turned in its report on the alleged indictment of Kyari by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nCompetent sources however revealed that what the panel recommended to the IGP was a demotion \u2013 the report which would form the basis of what the Police Service Commission would act upon.\n\n\u201cThe police report on Abba Kyari only recommends demotion to a lower rank. They figured that he could be extradited if dismissed. Kyari\u2019s real enemies are at the police service commission and what they want is an outright dismissal.\n\n\u201cBut they have to defer to the IGP. The IGP is no doubt Kyari\u2019s godfather. So we are waiting to see what he would approve,\u201d a top source had revealed.",

Consequently, the abnormal has become normal,\u201d Adesina said.\n\n\u201cTraveling on a road one day in Lagos, I saw an advertisement on a billboard which caught my attention.

Let\u2019s look at the party as supreme and go on with the decision of this party.\n\n\u201cI would like to say that the convention planned for the 30th of this month is on and we\u2019re going to be there and carry out our duties and improve our party.\n\n\u201cWe have processes and we have the national deputy chairman from the south, where he comes from and he is on course and he is now leading our party. His presence in the convention is not necessary at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why Secondus should go to this extent or try to ensure the party goes another different way completely. Secondus should have taken whatever happened simply being a founding member of the party. He should play the role he has been playing.\u201d\n\nReacting to the claim that governors wield a huge influence in the zoning of the party\u2019s presidential ticket, Jibril said the PDP has structures.\n\nHe said the governors have the right to make recommendations but the decision on zoning rests on the national executive council (NEC) of the party.",

          "text": "Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, has appealed to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to suspend its planned sit-at-home order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIPOB had announced that it will lock down the south-east if Nnamdi Kanu, its leader, is not released from detention by November 4.\n\nEmma Powerful, IPOB spokesperson, said the lockdown will be enforced between November 5 and 10.\n\nThe governorship election in Anambra state is billed to take place on November 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenting on the development in a statement issued on Wednesday, Chiedozie Ogbonnia, Ohanaeze spokesperson, said the lockdown may disrupt the election and cause \u201cuntold hardship\u201d for the people in the south-east.\n\n\u201cThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide pleads with the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to reconsider the 7 days\u2019 sit-at-home order in the south-east of Nigeria from November 5 to November 11. This is to enable the governorship election for Anambra State scheduled for November 6 to hold,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that Anambra state is the economic live wire of the south-east with an impressive steady growth trajectory. For instance, Anambra state showcases the best rural road network and rural community development in the south-east if not in entire Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnambra is home to the greatest number of small, medium and large scale industries in the south-east. Most recently, Anambra has added a cargo airport to its resource base. Above all, Onitsha is the largest market in West Africa.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the above illustration is that Anambra state is the melting pot of Igbo traders and artisans. It stands to reason that Anambra is the big Iroko tree that provides a shade for most Igbos. Apart from the shade, it also hosts the numerous birds that perch on the branches. Therefore any harm to the Iroko tree will create untold disastrous chain reactions and catastrophe for the Igbo.\n\n\u201cWhile pleading with the IPOB to rescind the lock down plan, Ohanaeze Ndigbo requests the chairman, south-east Governors Forum and the Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. Dave Umahi to convene an emergency meeting of Igbo stakeholders and the Youth Leaders to address the legitimacy crisis in the south-east, especially as it relates to Anambra State election and the political solution for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cIt is important to point out that one of the causes of the crisis of confidence in the South East is because of the yawning gap between the Youths and indeed the masses, on one side and the political leaders on the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTherefore, the leadership of the various youth groups should not be excluded in any meeting aimed at resolving the current crises in Igbo Land. In other words, the Youths want to be fully convinced of our commitment to their plight.\u201d",

          "title": "How Koa is helping Kenyans build and manage wealth",
          "text": "Despite being the third-largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa and East Africa\u2019s financial and commercial hub, Kenya has a savings rate of 12%, lowest in East Africa\u2014way below Africa\u2019s average of 17%.\n\nThere are many factors attributed to this low rate: high spending appetite among young Kenyans, high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and black tax. There\u2019s also a problem of cumbersome saving options and lack of proper financial education that exposes people to the importance of savings.\n\nThis is a big problem two pan-African tech operators Delila Kidanu and Alexis Roman are tackling through Koa, the digital saving platform they co-founded.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKoa founding story\n\nThe story of Koa can be traced back to MEST Africa as it\u2019s the first place the two co-founders met and worked. But the idea to start a company together hadn\u2019t been born yet. They were only heavily involved in MEST\u2019s mission, which is to incubate and help scale African entrepreneurs and startups, and were exposed to a lot of people and the process of building solutions for African problems.\n\nKidanu was born in Ethiopia, moved to Kenya as a child and lived there until she went to the UK to study international relations and business. She then moved to Sweden for a master\u2019s degree in innovation management and entrepreneurship. She proceeded to work with an NGO in Belgium to drive policies around global education before she moved back to Kenya to consult for international companies looking to set up shops in East Africa. After doing that for a while, she joined MEST Africa.\n\nRoman, on the other hand, was born in Paris but moved to Togo as a child where he stayed and schooled until he moved to Canada to study economics and finance. He started a business after school but later decided to go work in a traditional financial institution, which he called a mistake that came with lots of needed experience. He moved back to Africa to join MEST Africa in Ghana.\n\nAfter leaving MEST Africa, the duo forayed into different businesses but kept in touch and would always meet up whenever they were in the same city. Early 2020, they became colleagues again and started working as startup scouts for an early-fund venture capital, Microtraction.\n\nKoa co-founders\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Both Delila and I saw the popularity of digital saving products in Nigeria, like PiggyVest and Cowrywise, and how they were serving a real need for customers. But when we looked beyond Nigeria, as a market, we felt like there was a significant gap in other countries,\u201d Koa\u2019s CEO Roman told TechCabal.\n\nThey went ahead to speak to thousands of people in Kenya and discovered that 60% of the people relied on inefficient Informal Saving Groups and Cooperatives to save and access financial products. It became more obvious that lack of seamless saving option is another big factor aiding the problem. So they started deliberating about solving the problem the same way PiggyVest and Cowrywise are doing in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2020, they finally founded Koa with Bubunyo Nyavor, their old colleague from MEST. The platform went into beta in April and was launched to the public in June.\n\nThe platform makes it easy for users to set personal saving goals towards a particular expenses like paying school fee, buying a new phones, cars or even marriage. The app nudge users\u2019 by sending them daily, weekly or monthly reminders to deposit into the goals they set. Koa also makes it easy for users to track their progress so that they won\u2019t slack or help them back on track when they do.\n\nKoa is playing in a tough market and so is investing heavily in educational content that exposes its users to the importance of savings, especially in creating generational wealth. So far, according to Kidanu, the platform has already passed a 12,000 users mark and has received a deposit of 11,105,315.30 KES ($100,000) since its launch.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company pitched at the TechCrunch battlefield as one of the only two African startups that made the cut and was the only African startup that made it to top-five. Both co-founders said it was a great learning curve for them and another validation that their product is essential in solving this real-life problem.\n\nIncentive: make more money while saving\n\nIt\u2019s not only difficult for Kenyans to save; the lack of access to formal financial products also made it hard to invest. So, Koa is killing two birds with one stone by holding its users\u2019 money in a money market through a partnership with Britam, an asset manager in the Kenyan market.\n\nOn Koa, users earn up to 10% interest on their money annually, depending on market conditions. They also earn interest daily, which is good because they see their money grow in real time. This strategy has helped to cement the gospel of building wealth through saving and passive investing.\n\n\u201cOur partner has different types of funds. For us, we needed to be able to tap into a lower risk investment so that we don\u2019t lose our customer base that is a bit more risk-averse. So we opted to work with Britam to invest in their money market fund,\u201d Kidanu said on why they choose such investment and the reality of their promised ROI.\n\nIn fintech, customer trust is key. Once you hack that, scaling becomes a lot less harder. It\u2019s evident in the way savings platforms like PiggyVest transparently communicate with their users and how much loyalty their users have for them. So are Koa users aware that their money is being invested in a money market?\n\n\u201cCustomer trust is very important to us, and we communicate with our customers in terms of where their money is, who our partner is, why we chose them, and how their fund flow works. We only make the investment passive because we want to ensure a seamless experience for our users who are new to this,\u201d Kidanu added.\n\nMaking money for a company whose major mission is to first help people who, before now, wouldn\u2019t even think of saving money and building wealth can be tricky because charging customers directly can end up driving them away. They don\u2019t think of the money they could make but the little that\u2019s being asked of them. So how does Koa make money as a business?\n\n\u201cWe make money when we get a commission from our asset management partner on funds invested. So we didn\u2019t want a situation where we\u2019d have to charge our customers directly for the service. We want them to enjoy the service for free,\u201d Roman said.\n\nThe founders said they\u2019ve raised a pre-seed institutional investment. On the back of the raised funds and their seed round, which closes soon, Kidanu and Roman also plan to scale fast and expand to neighbouring countries like Tanzania and Uganda that have the same saving problem.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Apple\u2019s second fall event, tagged \u201cApple Unleashed\u201d, happened on Monday October 18 and everybody and their uncles have been talking about the exciting series of updates released at the event.\n\nUnlike its September event that opened with drone-captured California landscapes in the company of live music, this recent event opened in a small garage with instrumental music, composed from a combination of simple sounds from the Mac, AirPods and HomePod.\n\nApple released two new Macbooks: the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) and MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021). The tech company went further to silence its critics with the two biggest surprises of the day: two new M1 chips\u2014the Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max\u2014which will power the new MacBooks and promise tremendous performance improvements over the silicon chips in previous MacBooks.\n\nIn a beautiful transition between Tim Cook and Zain Lowe, Apple also revealed the Music Voice Plan, a new subscription category for Apple Music that allows users to seamlessly use Siri with Apple Music.\n\nThe tech giant also introduced AirPods 3 and some new HomePod mini colours.\n\nAnd in a move that looks like a joke but isn\u2019t, Apple wants to sell its users a microfibre cleaning cloth for $19. But that\u2019s Apple doing what it does best.\n\nHere is a detailed list of everything that was announced.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nApple Music subscription plan\n\nApple is undoubtedly bullish on music and how its users experience sounds. The fall event started off with the introduction of Apple Music Voice Plan, a new subscription offering that allows users to seamlessly enjoy Siri with Apple Music.\n\nSiri will now have custom playlists dedicated to various moods and settings and featuring several notable artists. The new Voice Plan will allow subscribers to listen to their favourite music at an affordable price.\n\nThis feature will kick off in 17 countries before expanding to more regions. As you might have guessed, no African countries are included in the kick-off regions.\n\nThe new Voice Plan will begin at just $4.99 a month, which is way lesser than the individual and family plan that are $9.99 and $14.99 respectively.\n\nApple Music plans\n\nNew colours for Apple HomePod Mini Smart Speaker\n\nAesthetics\u2014that\u2019s the simplest way to describe this update. Even though Apple won\u2019t be giving us colour variations in Mac, as demanded by lots of users, it has added new colours to the HomePod. They are now available in orange, yellow and blue.\n\nApple HomePod\n\nAirPods 3\n\nAirpods 3 was one of the most anticipated products on the list, and it was launched with new features. It has the same design as the AirPods Pro and is loaded with spatial audio along with new low-distortion drivers, with sweat and water resistance.\n\nIt has a battery life of over six hours and arrives with MagSafe and wireless charging. The new AirPods selling price starts at $179 and will be available from next week.\n\nM1 Pro And M1 Max Chips\n\nEarlier in this article, we called these updates the two biggest surprises of the night. We didn\u2019t get just one horsepower processor; we got two. Apple is generous and we appreciate that.\n\nThese two processors are like the SSC Tuatara of computer chips; they are, by far, the strongest and fastest processors from Apple\u2014and from any company\u2014to date.\n\nThese two chips power the newly released Mac.\n\nNew 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 MacBook Pros\n\nMacBook Pro\n\nIn our review of iOS 15, we mentioned that Apple is listening to its users now more than ever. And that\u2019s evident in this new update. The new Apple Silicon-powered MacBook Pros, in 14\u2033 and 16\u2033 variations, have a lot of the things people want. Some things they want them to add and some they want them to bring back.\n\nThere are more ports (HDMI and SD card reader), MagSafe charging, real function keys and no-touch bar, along with what they promise is blistering speed with extreme energy efficiency.\n\nThe two devices come with a 1080p camera, studio-quality mics, more powerful sound system, and large beautiful Mini-LED displays. Some critics likened it to a notebook with a superman ability.\n\nThe price starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. The basic models come as standard with the M1 Pro, 16GB of Unified Memory and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch comes with the 10-core CPU instead of the 8-core in the 14-inch.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Apple intentionally released simple iPhone upgrades to lead their competitors on. Intel did their social experiment ads and capitalised on the inefficiency of Apple; then Microsoft had their event boasting about how they have built the best PC in Surface Studios, combining a cool form factor,\u201d Dumebi Iwuchukwu, design lead at Big Cabal Media, and of course an Apple fanboy, said in his unusual slack rants.\n\n\u201cNow Apple has blown them out of the water with better chips. The 64gb video memory is the most futuristic innovation from Apple so far; plus all these happened amidst a global chips shortage.\u201d he reluctantly concluded.\n\nThe prices of the two devices go up as their specs thicken. For instance, there\u2019s an addition of $500 on 14-inch for the M1 Max with 24-core GPU; 32-core GPU adds $700. You can jump up to 32GB of Unified memory but for another $400, and there is a range of SSDs available, 2TB, 4TB, and 8TB for a whopping $2,400 more.\n\nThe fully specced out 16-inch comes in at $6,099.\n\nInsane. At this point, we\u2019ll have to agree with Dumebi that Apple has blown its competition out of the waters with these updates, or can you tell us what can beat this in the world?\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The country is home to one of the world\u2019s youngest populations, with increasing smartphone penetration, and has made notable advancements in regulations to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments.\n\nCertainly, there are challenges to operating a CBDC, one of which is the possibility of deposit flight from traditional commercial banks.\n\nMeasures to combat this concern include limiting the amount of CBDC held by each consumer as already implemented by the CBN and its zero interest rate, thus disincentivising the need to have a high stock of this asset. Regulators should begin to measure the level of acceptance of this digital currency within the next few months.\n\nBeyond Financial Inclusion\n\nA CBDC Regime for Efficiency in the Flow of Foreign Remittances\n\nOne of the major benefits canvassed for the development of the CBDC is the ability to solve the present inefficiencies in the flow of foreign remittances (FR). FR flow continues to be one of the greatest sources of revenue for developing economies such as Nigeria.\n\nThe World Bank data also indicates that remittance flow to Nigeria accounted for over 40% of remittance flows to the sub-Saharan region in 2020, while remaining the most expensive region to send money to.\n\nHow can the adoption of CBDC by central banks aid in solving the inefficiencies in the flow of FR? A major priority of the G20 has been the need to enhance cross-border payments by addressing the key challenges.\n\nVarious research efforts aimed at addressing these challenges indicate that by leveraging on technological advancement, a model like the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) solution for cross border funds transfer has the potential to complete a multi-currency cross-border payment process utilising wholesale multi-CBDCs (mCBDCs) within seconds.\n\nTo achieve these gains, it is imperative to factor an international dimension into the CBDC\u2019s design. This would require multi-jurisdictional collaboration amongst central banks, which takes interoperability across jurisdictions into account when countries are designing their domestic CBDCs. It is hoped that the design model behind the eNaira can permit coordination amongst peers once mCBDCs models become operational.\n\nBoosting Intra-African Trade by Digitising Trade Finance: A case for mCBDCs\n\nBeyond the tremendous potential for efficiency in the flow of FR, mCBDCs may provide a great avenue for boosting intra-African trade through a unified payment system for cross-border trade in goods and services within the African Continental Free Trade Area (\u201cAfCFTA\u201d).\n\nThe AfCFTA, once fully operational, promises to unlock immense value and economic development for the continent. Blockchain technology is delivering great rewards, which the continent has to fully embrace to make the quantum leap in economic development, especially after the setback experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs already stated, the DLT solution for cross-border and FX funds transfer has huge potentials for simplifying cross-border payment with great savings on time and money.\n\nResearch already reveals that it can deliver advantages like payment verification decentralisation, resilient payment landscape, payment innovation through utilisation of smart contracts, cash tokenisation, data integrity, and interoperability.\n\nThese are emerging solutions to pain points currently experienced in cross-border transactions, and African entrepreneurs and SMEs will benefit greatly from such a system.\n\nThe DLT solution is not without its problems like other technological innovations, and various jurisdictions are still ironing out the kinks. However, the conversation keeps progressing and Africa through AfCFTA must not be left out of the discourse as the DLT solution promises to be one of the major avenues for eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade within the continent.\n\nAsides from Nigeria, many African countries are actively exploring and researching the issuance of CBDCs in their jurisdictions. We believe that CBDC adoption within the AfCFTA is imminent, albeit progressive.\n\nThus, the importance of early cooperation amongst member states at the design stage, or at the latest, the pilot stage, cannot be overemphasised. If this window is missed, coordination at a later stage becomes cumbersome, time-consuming, expensive, and may set the continent back decades in its economic development agenda.\n\nThe unplanned and undesirable alternative would most likely be a proliferation of largely unregulated cryptocurrencies and their variants as a means of payment across large eCommerce platforms and the likely adoption of global alternatives to money such as the stablecoins, which is already a subject of discourse.\n\nConclusion\n\nNigeria has taken another bold step towards trade finance digitisation by introducing the eNaira; however, the journey has just begun. CBDCs have great potential for unlocking the exponential economic growth of Africa.\n\nSome countries and regional economic blocs are making great strides in developing workable solutions to unlock the value in mCBDCs adoption through partnerships with organisations like the Bank for International Systems (BIS).\n\nIf Africa is to tap into the huge potential for trade liberalisation offered by the AfCFTA, it needs to take a cue from these jurisdictions and explore partnerships for research and development into mCBDCs as a veritable means for cross-border payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAderemi Fagbemi Partner, Tech & Digital Law Desk at Tope Adebayo LLP | +234 809 992 7408 | a.fagbemi@topeadebayollp.com | Website Aderemi is a Partner with Tope Adebayo LLP with almost two decades of experience in the legal profession.

You want to bet on that idea \u2014 a hunch or a path you believe will provide groundbreaking solutions to an existing problem. Well, congratulations. (Un)fortunately, money is a necessary fuel \u2014 read evil \u2014 and taking the well-trodden path of getting funding, you decide to find investors.\n\nWhat should I do? Is a frequently asked question, but I think more people should ask questions like \u201cWhat should I not do?\u201d \u201cWhat is the surest way to fail big time?\u201d *Winks* at the Inversion Mental Model. And with data projecting that nine out of ten startups will fail, these seem like crucial questions to ask.\n\nWe\u2019re here for you. At Techpoint Africa, we have a bi-monthly series titled Angels and VCs. We have frank conversations with investors, asking them questions like determining what startups to invest in and things they think founders should avoid doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess what? We curated some exciting and sound fundraising advice dished out by investors in our conversations with them. Our Reporter, Chimgozirim Nwokoma, has done the legwork.\n\nDig in and enjoy: First time founder? Here\u2019s everything you need to know as you start raising money\n\nAutochek raises $13.1m to grow its car loaning platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek service provider with a customer\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? In a recently announced seed round, Autochek, an Africa-focused automotive tech company, raised $13.1 million. The round was co-led by previous investors, TLcom Capital and 4DX Ventures.\n\nOther returning investors are Enza Capital, Lateral Capital, Golden Palm Investment, and the venture capital arms of Toyota Tsusho Corporation & CFAO Group, ASK Capital and Mobility 54 Investment SAS, respectively.\n\nThis round comes after a $3.4 million pre-seed in November 2020. It will be deployed to improve the platform\u2019s loan financing model for car purchases and boost growth in its recent expansion into C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with Egypt and South Africa in view. But, what does Autochek do?\n\nThe platform leverages technology in providing a way to buy new and fairly-used cars, with an option to pay in instalments.\n\nLaunched in October 2020 and founded by Ikot Ekpe, former Co-founder and CEO of Cars45, Autochek presently operates in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThey have partnerships with 70 African banks, including the United Bank for Africa, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Kenya, with a network of over 1000 auto dealers and over 15000 vehicles on its marketplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoom out: It will not be out of place to connect Autochek\u2019s growth to the various acquisitions it has undertaken in the one year of its existence.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 14, 2020, Autochek announced the acquisition and operational management of Cheki\u2019s Nigeria and Ghana arm. Cheki is an online marketplace for automobiles. And on Tuesday, September 7, 2021, Autochek announced acquiring Cheki\u2019s Kenya and Uganda arm for an undisclosed price.\n\nGoing forward: The company aims to address the issue of credit penetration in auto markets by increasing access to auto financing for consumers across Africa with a simplified digital-first financing process.\n\nAnother smart address verification tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it just me? Living in Nigeria, you most likely have faced the challenge of describing unnamed turns that e-maps can\u2019t accurately capture to a delivery agent or a guest unfamiliar with your area. If yes, then you\u2019ve experienced firsthand the impact of a poor addressing system.\n\nRemember this? Inside the deep challenges of eCommerce and logistics in Nigeria\n\nThis issue affects not just delivery companies but Know Your Customer services for everyday businesses and individuals. How, for instance, do you verify the address of prospective clients or domestic staff? Smart address verification tools like Plus Codes, OkHi, and VeriFind, have been created to solve this challenge.\n\nIn July 2021, Nigerian Identity verification company, VerifyMe launched VeriFind, a geotagging solution to enhance verifying addresses.\n\nVeriFind\u2019s AI-based Geographic Information System (GIS) works with data pooled from a verification logistics network of over 25,000 physical agents in Nigeria. In this way, it identifies unnamed streets and corners.\n\nThe platform promises a faster experience as its technology enables real-time prescreening of addresses using GPS. In four months, it claims to have recorded 200,000 address verifications and over 600,000 GIS checks from its smartphone users. Also, customers can build their verification model with VeriFind\u2019s Software Development Kit.\n\nThinking out loud: One cannot help but wonder how effective this verification solution would be in actively tackling the issue of poor addressing systems for very remote areas. Although, with VeriFind\u2019s technology backed by over 20,000 last mile address verification agents, its remote reach is highly probable.\n\nYou can now bill friends and loved ones with Paystack\u2019s Pay for Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? African payment company, Paystack, has launched Pay for Me, a new feature that lets you shop on Paystack\u2019s and Product Link\u2019s storefront and have the bills paid by someone else of your choosing. I envision forwarding bills to rich aunties and uncles; sounds good if you ask me.\n\nBut how does it work? Let\u2019s say I want to use the Pay for Me feature to buy a bag on Paystack\u2019s storefront. I\u2019ll add the bag to my cart and fill in the necessary details at the checkout point. But, instead of selecting the \u201creview and pay\u201d option, I\u2019ll use the \u201cLet someone pay for you\u201d option.\n\nThis generates a link that you can share, even on social media. This service is available in Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa.\n\nAre my details safe? I know you care about your privacy, so does Paystack. When you send a Pay for Me link to someone, they only see your name and the product details. Information like your delivery address is not shown. Also, the buyer\u2019s details are protected; only their names and email address will reflect. Pay for me only works on Paystack and Product Link.\n\nOn that note, happy billing!!!\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nAjala Travel: Nigerian globetrotter who saw the world but died at home in poverty.

Not only do you have to come up with a good idea, but you also have to get customers, hire employees, manage your finances, and in this age of venture capital funding, get people to invest in your startup.\n\nOn their own, these are challenging tasks for anyone, but for a first-time founder with little or no experience, it can be overwhelming. As a result, we\u2019ve written this article to help you on your fundraising journey. Most investors \u2014 whether angel investors or traditional VC firms \u2014 receive several pitches daily from entrepreneurs looking to get funded. Therefore, you need to make it easier for them to consider you.\n\nTwice a month, we speak to angel investors and venture capitalists who have invested in African startups to get a peek into what they consider when deciding to invest in startups. So far, we\u2019ve spoken to Idris Bello, one of Andela\u2019s early investors, Maya Horgan Famodu, the Founder of Ingressive Capital, and Dayo Koleowo, partner at Microtraction.\n\nBefore we continue, it\u2019s important to note that the fundraising process often depends on what startup funding stage you\u2019re at. For this article, we\u2019ve focused on raising your first round of funding, usually in the first few months of operation.\n\nDetermine what type of investor you need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of money coming into the African tech ecosystem, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should attempt to bring every investor in on your cap table. For example, you don\u2019t need to apply to Y Combinator because everyone you know is applying; that\u2019s the wrong approach to take. You need to determine what kind of investor you want on your journey.\n\nThe relationship between investors and the startups/founders they invest in is almost similar to a marriage; you can\u2019t afford to get it wrong, or you may regret it. Investors often have criteria that they look out for, and you should also. For example, most people investing in Africa describe themselves as sector-agnostic. That may change as the ecosystem develops, but you need to ensure that your interest aligns with theirs.\n\nEarly stage venture firm, Microtraction, has a thing for fintechs. According to Koleowo, \u201cThere were just a lot of problems around financial services on the continent, and specifically in Nigeria. And thanks to companies like Paystack and Flutterwave, a lot of people built on top of that. And so, you find different founders trying to solve specific niches of the financial services, which I believe will continue because there are still aspects of financial services that need solutions.\u201d\n\nAngel investor, Yemi Keri could show interest if you have the kind of target audience she likes.

Chris Ngige, on Tuesday in Abuja, disclosed that the Federal Executive Council would soon present a policy directive on the casualisation of employment in the country.\n\nNgige made the disclosure at a one-day public hearing on Prohibition of Casualisation of Employment Establishment Bill, 2021.\n\nThe public hearing was organised by the Senate Committee on Employment, Labour and Productivity.\n\nNgige, while making his remark, appealed to the committee to stay action on the bill to enable the Federal Government to consult with other stakeholders in the labour sector.\n\nThis, he said, would make the proposed bill acceptable to all.\n\n\u201cThe bill is very tricky and we must manage it in such a way that both employers, workers other stakeholders, including the government, will buy into it when the bill is eventually passed into law,\u201d Ngige said.\n\nThe minister also described the casualisation of employment in Nigeria as worrisome, while accusing the banking, oil and gas, communication sectors as major perpetrators of casualisation of workers in the country.\n\nAccording to him, no reasonable government will allow the inhumanity to continue in the name of employment.\n\nNgige also said that most of the companies that were involved in casualisation of workers were doing so at a high risk.\n\nAccording to him, research has shown that most of the frauds in the banking sector are perpetrated by casualised staff because they believe that their jobs are not secured.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mr Mele Kyari who was represented by the Group Executive Director, Corporate Services, Aisha Farida Katagum, urged the committee to give the NNPC some time to study and review the bill before taking a position.\n\nHe said with the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NNPC was currently undergoing some reforms which may address the issues raised in the bill.\n\nKyari also dismissed the fear expressed by the Nigeria Labour Congress that there would be massive sack of workers in NNPC, given the ongoing reforms in the oil and gas sector.\n\nHe said he placed value on workers, pointing out that the reforms in the oil and gas sector would be carried out with human face.\n\nEarlier in his remark, sponsor of the bill, Sen. Ayo Akinyelure said that casualisation of Nigerian graduates in the labour market has become a subject of great concern as more workers continue to groan under the immoral strategy of cutting cost by employers.\n\nThis, he said, was making the workers to look inferior to their counterparts in other countries of the world.\n\nAkinyelure also listed the objectives of the bill to include protecting vulnerable workers against unfair labour practices by way of casualisation, imposing a legal duty on employers of labour, both in private and public sector establishments, to convert casual employment to permanent status, among others.\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Godiya Akwashiki said all the stakeholders would be given more time to review the bill, adding that the committee would invite them to another public hearing for further legislative action on the bill.\n\n...",

He said Sterling Bank adopted Lafia Beach, Alpha Beach and Eleko Beach in Lagos this year and intends to do more, adding that the strategy is to empower the youths and women in those communities to pick up plastic waste and recycle them for money, thereby creating a circular economy.\n\nAlso speaking, United Kingdom (UK) Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria, Mr. Ben Llewellyn-Jones said he was delighted to be a part of the effort to strengthen the discourse on tackling climate change in Nigeria. He noted that climate change is a common concern for all countries of the world. According to him, climate change is an urgent and potentially irreversible threat.\n\nMr. Llewellyn-Jones said, \u201cWe are at a critical moment for the future of our planet. Temperatures are rising, storms are raging and crops are failing across the world. Considering the impact of climate change and COVID-19, building back a fairer, greener and more resilient recovery and safer economy should be a big priority of all governments across the globe, including the UK and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAddressing challenges relating to climate change is at the heart of the UK government\u2019s agenda. We recognise the role that we, as a world leader in fighting climate change, have to use our voice and our influence to champion climate action,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that, \u201cThe 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties or COP26, which the UK is hosting in Glasgow in just under four weeks from today, is an invitation for all of us to rethink our way of life. And we will use our platform at COP26 to focus this ambition.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy High Commissioner said the UK\u2019s strategic framework and narrative for COP26 is centred around the four key goals namely: Mitigation, Adaptation, Finance and Collaboration. The partnership with the Creative Youth Community Development Initiative (CYCDI) has attracted a lot of attention and engagements with the government, creative industries, CSOs, education institutions, private sector players, youth groups and green entrepreneurs.\n\nMrs. Foluke Michael noted that Naija Climate Now has become imperative because by 2030s, there will be a significant reduction in the rainforest until it can no longer produce enough moisture. Species will be lost and the speed of global warming will increase.\n\nShe projected that, \u201cBy 2040s, greenhouse gas will be many times more potent than carbon dioxide, thus accelerating the rate of climate change dramatically. By 2050s, as the ocean becomes more acidic due to heat, coral reefs will die around the world and fish populations will crash significantly.\u201d\n\nMrs. Michael added that by 2080s, global food production will enter a crisis as soils become exhausted by overuse, pollinating insects will disappear and the weather becomes unpredictable and by 2100s, the planet will become four degrees Celsius warmer and large parts of the earth with millions of people rendered homeless and mass extinction everywhere while the Garden of Eden, the planet, will be lost.\n\nShe paid tribute to Sir David Attenborough for inspiring them at Solution17 with his documentary, \u2018Life on Planet.\u2019 We are mobilising everyone across Nigeria to act for Climate Change through education, creativity, innovation, technology and art in a bid to help them to reach goals pretty quick, she said. She added that the paintings that members of Solution17 developed are divided into four categories: Limiting Global Temp by 1.5 degrees, Climate Adaptation, Climate Finance and Collaborations.\n\nThe event was graced by His Royal Majesty, Oba Abdulwasiu Omogbolahan, Oniru of Iruland and Chief Nike Okundaye, Founder and CEO of Nike Art Gallery, among others.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The wife of Olu of Warri, Olori Atuwatse III, has disclosed plan of the Olu of Warri palace to bequeath an enduring educational legacy in Warri kingdom, this is just as she harped on the need for every child to receive quality education irrespective of social status.\n\nThe Olori stated this at the launch of Human Capital Africa (HCA), an accountability and advocacy initiative spearheaded by Nigeria\u2019s former Minister of Education, Obiageli Ezekwesili, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nWhile expressing worry on the decline in quality education in addition to the rising number of out-of-school children, she posited that there was no better way to build the future than by building the children through quality education.\n\nShe particularly expressed regret that rather than be a blessing to the people, the rich natural resources of Warri people have failed to uplift their standard of living.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cSince our ascension, the state of the Warri Kingdom has deeply disturbed my husband and I. The Delta region, where our kingdom is located, suffers from what we call the resource curse.\n\n\u201cA situation where our natural resource wealth, such as oil and gas, leads to poor economic outcomes in addition to creating environmental waste.\n\n\u201cMajority of our people are reeling from poverty and a lack of access while a few stakeholders benefit from the lucrative export. The high level of poverty in our region has turned our youth towards inexcusable illegal activities.\n\n\u201cThe poverty level has also contributed to rising number of out of school children especially in the rural/riverine areas.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), as of 2021, the total number of out-of-school children in Delta State is 146,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe total number for the south south is at an astronomical 1.2 million. Increasingly, our children\u2019s role models are those who find seeming success from less altruistic means of livelihood.\n\n\u201cOgiame Atuwatse III and I have made it one of our priorities to channel our influence and greater investment to our most important resource \u2013 the young people of Warri Kingdom.\n\n\u201cIt is our dream to build a prosperous future for the children of the kingdom, a future where they have opportunities to survive but to thrive.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the impact of quality education at a young age open boundless possibilities, the Olori, however, said that quality education should not be the preserve of the privileged few in the society.\n\n\u201cThat is why I did like to tell you about my hero. My father, Captain Hosa Okunbo, the third child from a family of 12, came from humble beginnings.\n\n\u201cFrom his primary to tertiary education, he attended public schools across Nigeria. in Benin, Warri, and Zaria, where he received a rich education that set him on the same career starting line as those from more privileged backgrounds.\n\n\u201cIn his lifetime, Captain built industries. But, more than that, he built people by providing work that enriched others intellectually and economically.\n\n\u201cToday, many of those in whom he sowed, including his children, are replicating that. This is the multiplier effect education has. it builds an individual who builds several others.\n\n\u201cCaptain attended Federal Government College, Warri when public education in Nigeria was at par with global standards.\n\n\u201cBack then, the average Nigerian child, regardless of social status, had the opportunity to receive excellent quality education that enabled them to stand shoulder to shoulder with their peers around the world. Unfortunately, today, it is not so,\u201d Olori Atuwatse III stated.",

          "text": "Ahead of the 30th and 31st Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\u2019s national convention, chairman, accreditation sub-committee and governor of Delta state, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, has said states where there were court orders on conflicting delegates would be exited from the accreditation list and barred from participating.\n\nOkowa, who stated this in Abuja Tuesday, also said the committee was putting everything in shape to ensure a hitch-free convention, expected to be graced by over 3,000 delegates.\n\nThe governor confirmed that some states were in court over conflicting delegates list and assured that all issues would be resolved amicably.\n\n\u201cWe are also trying to look at all the issues, including some people trying to stop some delegates at the court. But I think we are on top of all that, we will handle it and at the end of the day, by Thursday we will have the total accredited number of delegates. So I will give you the number of delegates when we meet on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cWe are not worried about what is going on, we always have a way of resolving our issues and God is always with us. You can see that most of the positions and aspirants are unopposed. So that shows you that the party is on course for a successful National Convention,\u201d he added.\n\nAnswering questions on the delegates\u2019 list, he said \u201cdelegates know themselves. There are no issues concerning delegates\u2019 election. But in about one or two states we still have issues, people contending in court as to whether some elected officials at the state, whether they should be there. There is one in Ekiti state and one other state. The legal adviser will before the end of the day offer his advice on it so that we will know what to do. So I don\u2019t think we will have any issue with that.\n\n\u201cWe may likely not have conflicting delegates, but wherever we think that there is a court order, we have no choice than to exit those delegates. Except for the statutory delegates who by their right and positions held in the past are not by reasons of election are supposed to be delegates.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remark, Okowa said the accreditation sub-committee was critical to the National Convention.\n\n\u201cOur convention holds from Saturday 30th to Sunday 31st October, which is just 4 days away from today. And we do realise that if we get the process of accreditation right, we will largely have gotten the convention right. And we do not pray that we get it wrong.\n\n\u201cSaturday is very critical to all us. We need to understand our role, we need to come early and hope that every material that will be needed will be available at that point in time,\u201d the governor said.\n\nAppeal committee\n\nMeanwhile, the party\u2019s screening appeal sub-committee Tuesday said it received five petitions at the end of the just concluded screening of aspirants for various positions during the convention.\n\nBlueprint reports that the PDP screening committee had earlier disqualified three aspirants from participating in the national convention.\n\nChairman of the Convention Committee and Adamawa state Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had last week disclosed that 31 candidates indicated interests for various national positions in the party, out of which 27 were cleared, one withdrawn and three disqualified.\n\nHe listed the disqualified aspirants as Prof. Wale Oladipo, Okey Muo-Aroh and Dr. Eddy Olafeso.\n\nOladipo was vying for the position of Deputy National Chairman (South), Muo-Aroh and Olafeso were eyeing the positions of National Secretary, and National Publicity Secretary respectively.\n\nFintiri said the aspirants were disqualified because they took the party to court with an intention to stop the national convention.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on the position of the aspirants, chairman of the sub-committee and former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu said: \u201cOn the whole, we received about five appeals, one is in respect of the non-clearance of the deputy national secretary, by the aspirant himself, Hon. Akintan Kareem.\n\n\u201cThere is also a petition in respect of clearance of the deputy national youth leader from Edo state for not being a party member, one Timothy Osadolor.\n\n\u201cOne of the petitions is in respect of Usman Shehu, an aspirant for national youth leader for forgery of certificates and age falsification.\n\n\u201cWe also received an appeal in respect of another aspirant for youth leader, Mohammed Usman for non-resignation of current position as a youth leader in his ward.\n\n\u201cWe also received the petition against the clearance of Amb. Taofeek Arapaja as deputy chairman for south for non-resignation of his existing position\n\n\u201cWe received three petitions; two of those petitions were in respect of the clearance of Sen. Sam Anyanwu as an aspirant for national secretary, claiming that he has taken the parties to court previously, against the party\u2019s constitution without exploring the internal mechanism of the party for complaint.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu stated that the committee also received a petition in respect of the disqualification of Olafeso contesting national publicity secretary, said Olafeso did not appeal his non-clearance.\n\nHe further said the 24-member committee drawn from different parts of the country, were people with vast knowledge and experience and assured that no matter the feelings of the appeal committees about those appeals, they have resolved to be a responsible body.\n\n\u201cWe will listen to all those that have written to us and hear from them. We will look at the document before us and possibly reconvene to look at the presentations and document before us and be able to drop a report which we send to the party as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWhen we are done, we also invite you again to brief you on the outcome of our assignments,\u201d Ekweremadu said.",
          "summary": "So that shows you that the party is on course for a successful National Convention,\u201d he added.\nExcept for the statutory delegates who by their right and positions held in the past are not by reasons of election are supposed to be delegates.\u201dEarlier in his remark, Okowa said the accreditation sub-committee was critical to the National Convention.\nBlueprint reports that the PDP screening committee had earlier disqualified three aspirants from participating in the national convention.\nOladipo was vying for the position of Deputy National Chairman (South), Muo-Aroh and Olafeso were eyeing the positions of National Secretary, and National Publicity Secretary respectively.\nFintiri said the aspirants were disqualified because they took the party to court with an intention to stop the national convention.",

          "title": "Buhari at Saudi investment summit: Underinvestment in humane projects cause of global insecurity",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has attributed growing social unrest to inequalities and unfair policies that exclude majority from opportunities for participation, admonishing world leaders and global investors to prioritise inclusive and humane policies.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at the 5th Edition of Future Investment Initiative Summit holding in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the president said his administration would \u201c keep encouraging public and private initiatives that increase investments in health, education, capacity building, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication, climate change and food security.\n\n\u201cBy so doing, it will go a long way in reenergizing the global economy in a post COVID-19 era.\n\n\u201cNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy and most populous nation. Our economic reforms which focus on \u201chumane\u201d investments are ideal for investors looking to have profitable returns while positively impacting the citizenry.\n\n\u201cYour Excellences, Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, Investing in Humanity is the right thing to do. I strongly believe the historical under investments in \u201chumane projects\u201d is the genesis of most of the insecurity and socio-economic challenges the world is experiencing today,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the theme of the summit, \u201cInvesting in Humanity,\u201d President Buhari said the Nigerian perspective remains a focus on people oriented development policies, with diversification from oil to more inclusive sectors such as agriculture, ICT and mining; tackling corruption, insecurity and climate change and introducing Social Investment Programmes.\n\n\u201cInvesting in humanity is investing in our collective survival. This is why we in Nigeria believe that public and private partnership should focus on increasing investments in health, education, capacity building, youth empowerment, gender equality, poverty eradication, climate change and food security. By so doing, it will go a long way in reenergizing the global economy in a post COVID-19 era.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population today exceeds 200 million people. Some 70 percent are under 35 years old. When we came into government in 2015, we were quick to realise that long-term peace and stability of our country is dependent on having inclusive and humane policies.\n\n\u201cIn the past six years, our government took very painful but necessary decisions to invest for a long-term prosperous future knowing very well that this will come with short term pains,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari commended the organisers of this year\u2019s summit for the foresight to look at \u201cinvestment,\u201d not only from a profitability and wealth accumulation point of view, but also bringing prosperity to humanity in general.\n\n\u201cThe humane approach to investment,\u201d he said, \u201cis the only way to address the global challenges we face, especially in the Covid-19 era.\n\n\u201cWe should continue to sustain our efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and mitigate its negative socio-economic impact on our societies, build resilience and achieve recovery. It is therefore my hope that this session will leverage on the enormous economic opportunities that lie ahead in order to satisfy the prevailing needs of our people and planet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said investment in humanity must also take into consideration the effects of debt burden on nations, which had been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe cannot invest in humanity without relieving our countries from the crushing effects of the debt burden especially when the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of deepening the debt portfolio of poor countries.\n\n\u201cThese nations increasingly allocate more and more resources towards external debt servicing and repayment at the expense of the health, education and other services that contribute to the overall wellbeing of their population,\u201d he said.\n\nDescribing the summit as a credible forum for interaction between the public and private sectors to explore ways of advancing economic growth, development and global prosperity, the president said Nigeria\u2019s diversification efforts continue to yield results, particularly in agriculture.\n\n\u201cWe introduced policies that supported investments in agriculture and food processing. We provided loans and technical support to small holder farmers, through the Anchor Borrowers Programme. As a result, Nigeria today has over 40 rice mills from less than 10 in 2014. Nigeria also has over 46 active fertiliser blending plants from less than 5 in 2014.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in agriculture, we have reformed the process of obtaining inputs such as fertilizer and seeds. We have several million hectares of available arable land and have embarked on the creation of Special Agriculture Processing Zones across the country. These initiatives we believe will make it easier for investors in agriculture,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari told the gathering of world leaders, global investors and asset managers that the oil sector was already undergoing a reform that would make it more attractive and inclusive.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago, I signed the Petroleum Industry Act. The Act will serve as a catalyst to liberalize our petroleum sector. It has introduced a number of incentives such as tax holidays, 100 percent ownership, zero interest loans and easy transfer of funds. In addition, we have highly skilled in-country workforce and a large domestic market.\n\n\u201cIn mining, we have also made several opportunities available for investors. Nigeria is a country rich in minerals from gold, iron ore, tin, zinc, cobalt, lithium, limestone, phosphate, bitumen and many others. We have made the licensing process easier and also made extensive investments in rail and transportation.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure investments represent significant potential for investors in Nigeria. We have opportunities in seaports, rail, toll roads, real estate, renewable energy and many others. We have created several institutions that are available to co-invest with you in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and more recently, I approved the creation of Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria. These institutions are run as independent world class institutions to make investments in the country and are available to coinvest with you,\u201d the Nigerian leader further said.\n\nHe further urged more interest in infrastructure such as healthcare and education, which \u201cpresent enormous opportunities for investors in a country our size.\u201d\n\n\u201cDigital Economy in Nigeria has many potentials for investment, as it has remained the fastest growing sector in both 2020 and 2021. Nigeria has many opportunities for investment in broadband, ICT hardware, emerging technology and software engineering.\n\n\u201cWe have recently approved the national policy on Fifth Generation (5G) network. Our aim is to attract investors in healthcare, smart cities, smart agriculture among others. The benefit of real time communication will support all other sectors of the economy,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nTo further improve and reposition the economy to attract investors, the president said \u201ce-Naira, the electronic version of our national currency, which puts us on track to become the first African country to introduce a Central Bank Digital Currency\u201d was launched on October 25th, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe believe this and many other reforms will help us increase the number of people participating in the banking sector, make for a more efficient financial sector and help us tackle illicit flow of funds.\n\n\u201cTo further strengthen our anti-corruption drive, increase accountability and transparency, we have centralized government funds through a Treasury Single Account, and ensuring that all Nigerians with a bank account use a unique Bank Verification Number (BVN). These initiatives, coupled with our nationwide National Identification Number (NIN) exercise, reinforce our efforts to tackle corruption and fraud. We believe that this should give investors a lot of comfort.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader also drew attention of world leaders to the devastating effect of climate change on livelihoods of people around the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cAs we strive to build resilience towards a sustainable economy in our various countries, let us not forget the negative impact of climate change on our efforts to achieve this goal. Nigeria and many countries in Africa are already facing the challenges posed by climate change. Climate change has triggered conflicts, food insecurity, irregular youth migration, raising level of sea waters, drought and desertification, as well as the drying-up of the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cIn the Lake Chad Basin region, where Boko Haram insurgency continues to undermine the peace, security and development of the region, climate change is largely responsible for the drying up of the Lake Chad which has shrunk by more than 85 percent its original size.\n\n\u201cThe diminishing size of the Lake is at the root of the loss of millions of livelihoods, displacement of inhabitants and radicalization of teeming youths in the region who are recruited to serve as foot soldiers in the insurgency.\n\n\u201cIn order to redress this situation and restore the lost fortunes of the Lake Chad Basin region, strong public-private partnership through massive investments will be needed to recharge the waters of Lake Chad. I am confident that this forum will rise to the challenge in the interest of durable peace and sustainable development of our region,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari conveyed heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the custodian of the two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud for the invitation and congratulated His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman for leadership and support through the Future Investment Initiative Summit.\n\n\u201cI remain confident that through such exchanges, the world indeed will be a better place. I hope and pray that this forum will rise to the challenge in the interest of durable peace and sustainable development,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Federal Ministry of Environment has said it is accelerating the implementation of various projects to address environmental challenges in the country.\n\nThe Minister of Environment, Sharon Ikeazor disclosed this at the meeting of the 15th National Council on Environment, NCE, held in Abuja, weekend.\n\nIkeazor said for Nigeria to realize the environment of her dream, it is imperative to consistently tackle environmental challenges such as climate change, deforestation, desert encroachment, loss of biodiversity, flood and erosion, environmental pollution amongst others.\n\nShe said that Ministry has developed strategies along the nine priority areas outlined by the current administration to build a thriving and sustainable economy; enhance social inclusion and reduce poverty; enlarge agricultural output for food security and export; attain energy sufficiency in power and petroleum products and expand transport and other infrastructural development.\n\nTo achieve agriculture and food security, and ensure energy sufficiency in power and petroleum products, according to Ikeazor, the Ministry is accelerating the implementation of the Ogoni Clean-up through Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP), saying that about 15.3 Hectares of polluted land has so far been remediated into arable land suitable for agricultural activities in Ogoniland.\n\n\u201cCurrently ongoing is the construction of six water supply schemes with a capacity of supplying 2400 cubic meters (m3) of potable water per day to communities across the four LGAs of Ogoniland.\n\nShe also said that the Ministry is accelerating the implementation of the Great Green Wall Programme, through its Agency, the National Agency for the Great Green Wall, NAGGW, which was established principally to reverse land degradation and desertification by supporting local communities in the sustainable management and use of natural resources to reduce poverty, enhance food security and promote sustainable livelihood.\n\nAccording to her, the Agency has cumulatively increased the total average of arable land recovered from a baseline of 90 Hectares in 2019 to 4,792 Hectares by the second quarter of 2021. It has also increased the number of trees (Orchards and Woodlots) Planted from one million and eighty thousand (1,080,000) to five million, six hundred and twelve thousand four hundred (5,612,400). In the same vein, the Federal Department of Forestry and Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria, FRIN, has also increased the vegetation cover from the baseline of one hundred and fifty-five thousand two hundred (155,200) trees in 2019 to six hundred and thirty-five thousand, eight hundred and forty (635,840) by the second quarter of 2021.\n\nIn addressing the adverse effects of pollution in the environment, the Ministry is ensuring compliance with global environmental agreements through transformative strategies such as The Extended Producer Responsibility, EPR, the framework being implemented in three sub-sectors; electrical electronics equipment, food and beverages, and battery waste streams. The goal is to formalize the activities of producers in these sectors to ensure sustainable production and consumption processes.\n\nAnother strategy is the Implementation of a comprehensive program on the domestic use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas.\n\nShe explained that the Ministry has taken positive steps towards the actualization of the Gas Utilization Initiative, GUI: Development of Environmentally Friendly & Sustainable Gas to Energy Master Plan (Mapping of Gas Flare Points Project in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister, therefore, urged National Council to critically appraise the emerging challenges faced by the environment while also acknowledging the opportunities that are inherent to be able to balance our actions towards achieving a sustainable environment.",

It has also increased the number of trees (Orchards and Woodlots) Planted from one million and eighty thousand (1,080,000) to five million, six hundred and twelve thousand four hundred (5,612,400). In the same vein, the Federal Department of Forestry and Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria, FRIN, has also increased the vegetation cover from the baseline of one hundred and fifty-five thousand two hundred (155,200) trees in 2019 to six hundred and thirty-five thousand, eight hundred and forty (635,840) by the second quarter of 2021.\n\nIn addressing the adverse effects of pollution in the environment, the Ministry is ensuring compliance with global environmental agreements through transformative strategies such as The Extended Producer Responsibility, EPR, the framework being implemented in three sub-sectors; electrical electronics equipment, food and beverages, and battery waste streams. The goal is to formalize the activities of producers in these sectors to ensure sustainable production and consumption processes.\n\nAnother strategy is the Implementation of a comprehensive program on the domestic use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas.\n\nShe explained that the Ministry has taken positive steps towards the actualization of the Gas Utilization Initiative, GUI: Development of Environmentally Friendly & Sustainable Gas to Energy Master Plan (Mapping of Gas Flare Points Project in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister, therefore, urged National Council to critically appraise the emerging challenges faced by the environment while also acknowledging the opportunities that are inherent to be able to balance our actions towards achieving a sustainable environment.",

          "title": "Nigeria: $3.097bn Investment Opportunities Exist in Condensate Refineries, NNPC Says",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said investment opportunities worth nearly $3.097 billion currently exist in the country\u2019s condensate refineries\u2019 space. Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated this on Tuesday in Lagos in his keynote address at the 15th Oil Trading and Logistics (OTL) Africa Downstream Week.\n\nKyari said between $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion were required by the corporation to improve the supply and distribution of petroleum products, revamp Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) infrastructure, and build Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) plants in the country.\n\nKyari, who was represented at the event by the Group Executive Director, Downstream, NNPC, Mr. Adetunji Adeyemi, projected that Nigeria\u2019s petroleum product demand would grow to 17.3 million metric tons by 2025, up from the 15.1 million MT in 2020.\n\nThe theme of the conference was, \u201cDownstream in Transition: Getting Set.\u201d\n\nKyari added that the country would need a refining capacity of about 1.52 million barrels per stream day (MBPSD) to meet its petrol requirement in the next four years.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs Nigeria\u2019s demand for petroleum products is expected to grow from 15.1 million MT in 2020 to 17.3 million MT by 2025, the country needs a refining capacity of about 1.52 million barrels per stream day (MBPSD), to meet its PMS requirement in the next four years.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries\u2019 445,000 BPSD and Dangote Refinery\u2019s 650,000 BPSD running at 60 per cent and nameplate capacity, respectively, would supply 76 per cent of that requirement, leaving a shortfall of about 17 million litres of PMS daily.\n\n\u201cNNPC is adding 215,000 BPSD of refining capacity through private sector driven co-location at the existing facilities in PHRC and WRPC, respectively. Modular refineries are also adding capacities, such as the 5,000 BPSD Waltersmith refinery, which will be upgraded to 50,000 BPSD.\n\n\u201cAdditional 250,000 BSPD is expected to come from the Condensate Refineries through the private sector partnership. The co-location and condensate refineries will close the PMS supply-demand gap and create positive returns to the investors.\n\n\u201cAbout $3.097 billion investment opportunities exist in condensate refineries while $1.6 \u2013 $2.7 billion is required by NNPC to improve the supply and distribution petroleum of products, revamp LPG infrastructure and build CNG plants.\u201d\n\nKyari said the demand for natural gas could grow about four times over the next decade, increasing from 4.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in 2020 to between 10 \u2013 23 bcf/d in 2030.\n\nHe said currently, supply to the domestic market was about 8bcf/d to power, 0.77 bcf/d to industries, and about 54 bcf/d was flared, while 3.2 bcf/d was for export gas through the LNG and the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP).\n\nAccording to him, achieving this growth in demand would be occasioned by increasing the dispatchable capacity of existing power in line with the Presidential Power Initiative, which is less than 1.4 bcf/d).\n\nHe added that the growth would be achieved through assuring delivery of major fertiliser projects (Dangote, Brass) 5 bcf/d), and enabling industrial demand for natural gas in the northern axis of the country (1.2 bcf/d).\n\nOn the global oil market outlook, Kyari said, \u201cSome $10.4 trillion global stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rebound in consumers\u2019 spending while incentives for long-term investments in hydrocarbon has waned.\u201d\n\nHe stated that hydrocarbon would continue to be relevant in the global energy mix for the next two decades, quoting the recent data by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nAccording to the data, the world oil demand was expected to rise from a pandemic stricken 90.6 million bpd in 2020 to 108.2 million bpd in 2045, thereby accounting for 28 per cent of global energy needs. The OPEC data further stated that the rise in demand would be driven by growth in world population, which is set to expand to 9.5 billion by 2045, and the huge potential for expanding access to modern energy services for the under-served.\n\n\u201cHowever, $11.8 trillion in oil-related investments will be required mostly in the US upstream to meet the market needs,\u201d Kyari noted.\n\nOn the issue of downstream in transition, the NNPC boss noted that the Nigerian oil and gas industry has been in transition prior to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) passage in response to the global energy transition and decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nKyari maintained that it would be difficult to discuss the transition in the downstream sub-sector in isolation from the overall evolution that was happening in the industry. He said NNPC had diversified its portfolio over the years, transiting to an energy company with new investments in gas, power, and renewables, pointing out that key pipeline projects are on-going to assure delivery of gas to the demand nodes.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe OB3 project, which brings gas from East to West, is nearing completion. The 614km Ajaokuta, Kaduna, Kano (AKK) project, which was launched by Mr. President in June 2020, is progressing very well. These could add up to $40 billion to annual GDP and create additional six million jobs.\n\n\u201cThe corporation has progressed with the Refineries Rehabilitation Programme to further boost its participation in the Oil and Gas value chain by awarding the $1.5 billion Port Harcourt rehabilitation contract with the commitment to deliver on Warri and Kaduna Refineries.\n\n\u201cThe rehabilitation of critical downstream infrastructure comprising of major pipelines, depots and terminals through the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) financing model is on course.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has declared 2021 \u2013 2030 as decade of gas development in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKyari explained that the transition in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector was being driven by the global decarbonisation efforts to switch to renewables in response to environmental concerns.\n\nAs investments in hydrocarbon continued to wane due to energy transition and geopolitics, Kyari said the world economy faced shortages, high energy prices, rising inflation and sluggish growth.\n\nPeter Uzoho",

          "text": "A Japanese startup backed by soccer player Keisuke Honda hopes to persuade wealthy consumers to swap their supercar for a 77.7 million yen ($680,000) hoverbike which went on sale on Tuesday.\n\nThe \u201cXTurismo Limited Edition\u201d from Tokyo-based drone startup A.L.I. Technologies is equipped with a conventional engine and four battery-powered motors and promises to fly for 40 minutes at up to 100 kph (62 mph).\n\n\u201cUntil now the choice has been to move on the ground or at scale in the sky. We hope to offer a new method of movement,\u201d Chief Executive Daisuke Katano told Reuters.\n\nThe black and red hoverbike consists of a motorcycle-like body on top of propellers. The machine rests on landing skids when stationary.\n\nThe startup, whose backers include industrial heavyweights Mitsubishi Electric (6503.T) and Kyocera (6971.T), demonstrated the bike with a short flight a few metres off the ground at a race track near Mount Fuji.\n\nKatano said that in the near term its uses will be limited to such sites \u2013 and will not be allowed to fly over Japan\u2019s packed roads.

You say [it will be valid] for two years and tell us to vote for it. Why?\u201d CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu asked Erdogan in an address to his party members in parliament.\n\nThe CHP party voted against the deployment of Turkish forces in Iraq in 2003, but had otherwise backed Erdogan in his various international campaigns.\n\nThe new motion allows the military to carry out cross-border operations against groups deemed by Ankara as \u201cterrorist organisations\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe risks and threats to national security posed by ongoing conflicts in regions near Turkey\u2019s southern border are continuing to increase,\u201d the motion presented to parliament by Erdogan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) said.\n\nEarly this month, Erdogan said Turkey was preparing to step up operations in Syria, where its forces came under attack from Kurdish fighters supported by Washington in the fight against the ISIL group.\n\nTurkey and its proxies have seized control of territory in northern Syria over four military operations launched since 2016, heavily targeting Kurdish fighters there.\n\nThe fighters have used their hideouts in northern Iraq as a springboard for attacks aimed at Turkish soil for decades. The Turkish army often bombs their bases in the mountainous regions.\n\nAnkara says it uses its right under international law to self-defence, although the operations cause strains in ties with Baghdad.\n\nTurkish authorities said on Tuesday that security forces \u201cneutralised\u201d five Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq.\n\nAccording to the Turkish National Defence Ministry, they were targeted in the Zap region.\n\nTurkish authorities use the term \u201cneutralise\u201d to mean the targets in question surrendered, were killed or were captured.",
