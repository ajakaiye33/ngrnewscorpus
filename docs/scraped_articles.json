          "title": "S\u2019West PDP leaders tackle Aliyu over presidential ticket comment",
          "text": "\u2022Ignore him, he doesn\u2019t speak for us \u2013Party\n\nProminent Peoples Democratic Party leaders in the South-West have faulted claims by ex-Niger State Governor, Babangida Aliyu, that the party had zoned the 2023 presidential ticket to the North.\n\nThe former governor said on Friday when members of the Atiku Support Organisation visited him in Minna that the party had zoned its presidential ticket to the North.\n\nBut a former National Secretary of the PDP, Prof. Wale Oladipo, who spoke with our correspondent on Saturday, faulted Aliyu\u2019s claim.\n\nOladipo said, \u201cHe (Aliyu) should be asked at what meeting the decision was made? To the best of my knowledge, the National Executive Committee meeting and the expanded caucus meeting decided that we were going to zone only party offices and that we would reconvene later to discuss the issue of the presidential candidate, whether we would zone it or not.\n\n\u201cWe also set up a committee and the committee has submitted its report where it was clearly stated that the presidential ticket be thrown open to all Nigerians who are members of the PDP. That was the last discussion we had about our presidential ticket. No meeting has been convened after that to either zone the ticket to the North or to the South.\n\n\u201cIf he is supporting a particular aspirant, he is free to do that just like some of us will also take decisions to support whoever we like later.\n\n\u201cThe party has not taken any decision on that. I am a member of NEC and also a member of the Board of Trustees of the party. Those are the top organs and we have not taken that decision at all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, a former National Vice Chairman of the PDP in South-West, Chief Bode George, while responding to inquiry by our correspondent on the issue, said he had no idea that the party had zoned the ticket to any region.\n\nGeorge said, \u201cI have no idea that the position has been zoned to the North. The party did not meet to take that decision. When we zoned the national offices, it was agreed that the presidential ticket be left open to the entire country. The former governor is a member of the BoT and I am sure he is an honourable man.\n\n\u201cBut I am also sure that the party has not met to take any decision on that, unless he has any information not known to us or he is privileged to information that we do not know. I also know that the party at the national level would not play with the southern caucus. This is because, when we sneeze, the entire nation catches a cold.\u201d\n\nAlso, a member of the PDP BoT, Dr Saka Balogun, said what the ex-governor said was new to him.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is an organ for processing that kind of statement and to the best of my knowledge, that organ, that is the National Working Committee of the party has not met and if the NWC has met, they have not given us such information.\n\n\u201cEven when they meet, they don\u2019t decide in isolation, there are other organs which have to be taken into account, I am a member of the party\u2019s BoT and we have not been informed of anything like that.\n\n\u201cThere is also the PDP Caucus in the National Assembly and to the best of my knowledge, such a decision has not been conveyed to that organ. I think that is his own personal opinion and to say PDP has settled for a presidential candidate is an overstatement.\u201d\n\nBesides, another member of the party\u2019s BoT, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, told Sunday PUNCH that he was not aware that such a decision had been made by the party.\n\nBabatope, who is a former Minister of Transport said, \u201cI have not been told that as a leader in the party. I am not aware of that. We have a good leadership in the PDP. Iyorchia Ayu is a credible leader and that gives us hope and confidence that everything is now well with the party.\u201d\n\nThe party has also urged Nigerians to ignore Aliyu\u2019s statement, saying it didn\u2019t represent the party\u2019s position on the matter.\n\nThe party in a statement on Saturday titled, \u201cWe have not zoned our presidential ticket,\u2019\u2019 by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, described Aliyu\u2019s statement as misleading.\n\nThe party statement read in part, \u201cThe attention of the Peoples Democratic Party has been drawn to comments and speculations from certain individuals claiming that our party has zoned its presidential ticket to a particular part of the country. This is completely misleading as it does not in any way represent the position of our party.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country. The PDP therefore urges Nigerians, our teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled. Our party also cautions those behind the claims to desist forthwith.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We thought we are the only people witnessing it, but with the award you got from the wife of the Inspector General of Police, it is an eloquent testimony that what we are seeing as a state is also being observed from all the nation,\u201d Wike stated.\n\nThe governor said policing in Rivers State has improved remarkably because the management of the Nigeria Police Force at the Force Headquarters and the state command, respectively, distanced themselves from politics.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we will continue to support the security agencies in the State. Our support for security agencies is not only centered on the police force. We are also extending similar gesture to the Navy, Air force and others. For us, we believe the primary function of any responsible government is to protect life and property. So, we have no option than to continue to support in providing logistics and everything that can make the security agencies in the state function very well.\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that if our people are safe and life here is peaceful, there will be an increase in economic activities and the Internally Generated Revenue will also go up,\u201d the governor added.\n\nHe commended Eboka, the 42nd CP in Rivers State for discharging his duty professionally and not joining the league of some of his predecessors, \u2018\u2019who were posted to the state to cause turmoil and instability.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governor announced a N1 million reward for each of the recipients of the Rivers State Police Command award and N10mn for the command for organizing the event.\n\nEboka explained that 2021 was a remarkable year because Rivers State emerged as one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, the award recipients include: Godstime Nwuju, (best traffic officer); Insp Winfrey Akpan, (best controller); CSP Bako Aghashim, (best Divisional Police Officer); CSP Grace Wonwu, (best female DPO) while CSP Adamu was awarded the best visiting tactical team leader.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Lagos Nurses union reaffirms vow to embark on 3-day warning strike",
          "text": "By Chris Onuoha\n\nThe National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Lagos State Council has reiterated its resolve to go on a 3 day warning strike starting on Monday January 10 through Wednesday, January 13.\n\nAt a general congress of all the Nurses in the State held on Friday, January 7 in Lagos, the Council stated that there is no going back on the planned strike, saying that Lagos State government has not come up with an agreeable truce over their demands. This, according to the union, will mount to severe consequences on the residents of Lagos whose healthcare demands would be impeded.\n\nIn a statement by the Chairman of the Council, Olurotimi Awojide, he disclosed that efforts made overtime to let Lagos State government to resolve the situation has proved inconclusive, hence, the need to press home their demand with a warning strike as the situation demands.\n\n\u201cThe Council decided to embark on a three-day warning strike after careful consideration to call the attention of the Government to the severity of the situation and to get them to address the issues promptly. The association has engaged Government on several occasions on these issues without the desired pace of outcome. In our estimation, the Lagos government is yet to fully come to terms with how incredibly challenging the situation in the health sector has been for our members especially in the last two years,\u201d said Awojide.\n\nAwojide reiterated that Nurses are critical assets to the nation, saying that the increased foreign labour migration of Nurses is no longer news and has further overburden and overstressed the Nurses that are still in service.\n\n\u201cAccording to our records, more than 496 Nurses left the service of the Lagos State Health Service Commission between 2019 to 2021. Over 200 Nurses left the service of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital within the same period. Over 80 left the Primary Healthcare Board within the last two years which has only about 700 Nurses and Midwives. It is clear that Nurses do not find job satisfaction or fulfillment here. Nurses are quitting within weeks of taking appointments,\u201d remarked Awojide.\n\nHe also noted that besides the acute shortage of Nurses and Midwives, retention of incentives for those in service which are currently being enjoyed by other health workers must be considered.\n\nOthers are proper consolidation of Salary Structure to tally with those in Federal Service with improved working conditions, regularization of graduate Nurses, hazard allowance and life insurance for Nurses, Nurses representation in relevant Boards among others.\n\n\u201cI want the public to know that we have their interest in our heart and it is not our wish to embark on strike, but the issue is that when Nurses who are the most essential healthcare workers are not happy, they cannot give quality service.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is for the Lagos State government to be agile in its response to the challenges of Nurses and to come up with comprehensive and well-thought-through policy responses to reduce the turnover rate among Nurses by rewarding their service appropriately,\u201d said Awojide.",

          "text": "By Chris Onuoha\n\nElerinmo of Erinmo, Oba Michael Odunnayo Ajayi, has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari may have meant well by trying to involve traditional rulers in tackling insecurity, but said that it must be backed with constitutional actions.\n\n\u201cI want to believe that the speech was made in good faith. It is a welcome development coming from the President, but it is not enough to challenge traditional rulers to take charge of their people\u2019s security. What is more important is to empower the traditional rulers to be able to carry out these responsibilities.\n\nMuch as I would like to thank the President for remembering monarchs as the missing link, I would also urge him to take a step further by recognising and stating specific roles for us in the constitution. This will in no small way have positive effects on our present predicaments\u201d, Ajayi said while reacting to the President.s New Year broadcast to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI have long been an advocate of making the traditional rulers the fourth tier of the government. Indeed, let me fly a kite here by saying that traditional institutions should actually be the recognised authority at the local government level. Responsibilities must be matched with equal level of authority. Long before Africa was colonised, traditional institutions had existed and had taken charge of not only the security but also the general administration of our people as well as their welfare at the local government level. The real question is why are the traditional rulers not given that role in the Nigerian constitution?\n\n\u201cHowever, it is a known fact that no traditional ruler can turn a deaf ear to the plight of his people. I believe the time has now come to engage monarchs in governance beyond being symbolic representatives of their people. I view the statement from the President as a sign that sooner than later, he will be given more attention and support to the monarchs to take charge of things at the local level and in their respective domains: one of which is to ensure that there is a budget that matches the responsibilities given. I have always wondered why security votes gets to the States but none ever comes to the traditional rulers\u201d.\n\nThe monarch went on: \u201cTalking about the herders and farmers clashes, it has many angles to it. Firstly, I believe the ranks of many of the so called herders has been infiltrated by bad elements or bandits as you call them, who are outrightly there for criminal purposes. Secondly there has always been a competition for available resources between farmers and herders which even from time immemorial, has led to clashes, though not as violent as it is now.\n\nThe world, no doubt has advanced and there are better and more economically beneficial ways to rear animals as well as farming. The government needs to engage the major stakeholders without taking sides to ensure that the other root causes of these problems, the sponsors of these evil and those benefiting from the problems are brought to justice to avoid anarchy.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of state police, I still find it difficult to understand what people mean by that under the present structure we have in Nigeria today. In Yoruba land we say when a child falls he/she looks forward but when an elder falls, he looks back to see the root cause. The way forward is to look back and go back to where we started from. In a country like the United States of America, they have police department structure in each State and County. There is no overall Inspector General of Police.\n\nEvery locality develops the kind of police that suits its needs. Such structure is not enshrined in our constitution for now. That is one area the legislatures have to look into. No doubt all crimes are local to a certain extent but our present federal structure is federal in words but not indeed. I will suggest that the elected parliamentarians should go back to their respective constituencies to get their people\u2019s views and of cause this must involve the traditional institutions to avoid abuse of power before State police becomes a reality.",

Clement Ekpeye, has stated that the problem the nation is facing would be a thing is the past if Nigerians would accept change genuinely.\n\nEkpeye spoke yesterday at Ochigba, in Upata Kingdom, Ahoada East Local Government Area at the 10th memorial anniversary in honour of the late King of Upata/Ekpeye, His Royal Highness, Late King Clifford Nwuche, Eze Igbu Upata II of Upata Kingdom, father of a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives Hon Chibudom Nwuche.\n\nREaD ALSO:Support good govt to deliver, PDP urges Lagos citizens\n\nSpeaking, the cleric stated that the challenges the nation is facing is because the people have failed to accept change and abandon sin, adding that anyway the people accept right attitude that change would come.\n\nEkpeye, who was speaking on the topic, \u2018Life after Death\u2019, regretted that church has not been able to bring the needed change, adding that the more churches come the more evil spread.\n\nHe said: \u201cEven evil men are also remembered, but we know that there are people who died without helping anybody and they are remembered, how much more can we then remember those who helped and built people?\n\n\u201cIf we repent what we are passing through in Nigeria will not be there. What we are seeing is as a result of sin. As churches increase, crime and evil increase.\n\n\u201cThe challenges we are facing in this country will be a thing of the past if we change from sinning. We are calling on you to change. May not be able to please man try to please God.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the former Deputy Speaker, Hon Chibudom Nwuche, stated that the late Eze, lived a worthy, adding that it was important for individuals to lead a good life.\n\nChibudom said :\u201dMy father lived a worthy life and he was a politician, a business man, and a king of our people. He was also a party Chairman of NPP, those days. His life was rich.\n\n\u201cIt is 10 years since he passed on. Today was a day for the family to remember him and mark it in solemn manner in the mood of the nation.\n\n\u201cIt is a lesson for all of us, that soon will go to be with our lord. We must make sure we leave a good name even after we have gone our did will still speak for us.\n\nHe opined that what makes good leadership is when the leader shows more interest in serving that people through his office and not focused on what he benefits from the office.\n\nChibudom said: \u201cWe cherish people that is why we have offered ourselves for the service of our people not because we need the benefits that come with the office, but because we believe that society is meant to enhance the welfare of people who are lowest.\n\n\u201cWe are always with the people in spite of our so called elevation we are still down to earth and they can rely on us and can meet them at the point of need within our means.\n\n\u201cWe live for each other.

She also assured that healthcare in Edo would always be accessible to the poor, with the administration to explore all existing health policies and programmes that would take care of the poorest of the poor. Akoria spoke with reporters yesterday in Benin.\n\nEdo Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Col. David Imuse (rtd.), last week accused Obaseki of insincerity on the proposed demolition of central hospital, Benin, which he declared that Edo governor wanted to turn into a motor park, instead of completing phase two of Edo Specialist Hospital in the state capital, which was started by his predecessor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, a former National Chairman of APC.\n\nEdo health commissioner said: \u201cIn recent time, anybody who has been to the Central Hospital, Benin, will see the state of the structure, infrastructure and service provision. So, the decision to upgrade healthcare for the citizens meant that there has to be a lateral phased movement of services from Central Hospital to Edo Specialist Hospital.

We have stationed about ten teams right there, between Stella Obasanjo Specialist Hospital and Central Hospital, both in Benin City, and as patients come, they are accessing the team\n\n\u201cThere is something called the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund, which is supposed to take care of the healthcare needs of the poorest of the poor, through insurance and our people are already paying for insurance.\u201d Akoria also revealed that the Federal Government had provided some funds, the state government has its own counterpart funding, while there were many mechanisms that were on the ground that would take care of the health needs of different strata of the population.",

          "title": "National Convention: APC crisis deepens as Govs Forum DG demands Buni, Akpanudoedehe\u2019s resignation",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday took disturbing dimensions when the Director-General of the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, demanded immediate resignation of the Chairman and Secretary of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni and Sen John James Akpanudoedehe, respectively.\n\nThe PGF DG hinged his demand for their resignation on their failure to put practical arrangements in place for the initially agreed February 5, 2022 APC National Convention.\n\nIn the letter dated January 5, 2022 he wrote to PGF Chairman, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, Lukman also urged Governor Buni to clear himself from the speculations that he wants to transmute to the substantive National Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cAs things are, if the APC National Convention is to hold February 5, 2022 as decided, by January 15, 2022, notice of the Convention must be transmitted to Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as required by the Electoral Act. In which case, details of the agenda of the Convention and Venue should have been decided. If this is not the case, it should be taken that the CECPC chairman, Mala Buni and Secretary, Akpanudoedehe have decided not to implement the decision to hold the Convention on February 5, 2022.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere in APC Constitution or any law for that matter, that confer prerogative of whether an important decision such as holding the National Convention should hold or not on the party Chairman and Secretary. At best, if there are challenges, they should present the challenges to superior organs of the party.\n\n\u201cIt may be necessary for party leaders to therefore consider convening emergency meeting of the National Caucus to review all these developments and perhaps give opportunity to the Chairman, Mala Buni and Secretary, Akpanudoedehe to explain whatever difficulty they may be having.\n\n\u201cIt may also be necessary to appeal to both Mala Buni and Akpanudoedehe, in the event that superior organ of the party, possibly the National Caucus, is unable to meet before January 15, 2022, they should take the path of honour and honourably resigned if by that date they have not conclude preparations for the Convention and appropriate notice to INEC duly served as required by the law.\n\n\u201cShould that be the case, Your Excellency, may again have to provide the leadership to facilitate consultations with President Buhari and all party leaders to choose necessary replacements from among members of the CECPC or in whatever way possible. Your Excellency, at this point, given experiences first with the Comrade Oshiomhole-led NWC and now with the His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC, there is the glaring issue of political leadership recruitment challenges, which if not resolved will continue to undermine the capacity to produce competent political leaders in the country,\u201d he warned.\n\nAlso reflected in the letter he wrote to the PGF Chairman, included his warning that the duo are taking the Governors Forum for granted.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cAs the Chairman of Forum, you had to take very difficult internal initiatives to unite Governors and party leaders.\n\n\u201cYou were able to earn the confidence of President Buhari and party leaders based on your leadership ability to ensure that all Governors are united to support the work of the CECPC. Your Excellency, it would appear that both the CECPC Chairman, Mala Buni and Secretary, Akpanudoedehe are taking the support of the Forum for granted to the point of working to sabotage the decisions of holding the APC National Convention on February 5, 2022 based on the recommendations of Forum.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dangerous trend. Some of the speculations as the reasons for that include the alleged ambition of Mala Buni to manipulate his emergence as the substantive National Chairman of the party. Ideally, there should be nothing wrong with this once he is able to satisfy the requirements of the law and the party\u2019s Constitution. If true, however, the assumption that he will provide neutral leadership, which is required to guarantee level playing field that was the basis of vesting him with the responsibility of serving as the Chairman of CECPC has been eroded.\n\n\u201cShould it be confirmed that Mala Buni is aspiring to be the substantive National Chairman of APC, in whatever way possible, elementary logic required that he should be immediately replaced as Chairman of CECPC. This is further strengthened by the fact that being a serving Governor, he is disqualified to aspire to hold any position, which the law only permits him to hold on temporary basis,\u201d he warned.\n\nLukman also copied party leaders like President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President. Sen Ahmed Lawan Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon.

          "text": "Northern elders: Buhari\u2019s comments on restructuring, state police insensitive\n\n\u2022 There should always be room for political solutions\n\nFrom Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari dos not have the final say on the contentious issues of restructuring, state police, and the release of detained agitators for self-determination.\n\nReacting to President Buhari\u2019s statement in an exclusive television interview on Wednesday, spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Hakeem Baba-Ahmad said the voice of majority of Nigerians advocating restructuring must be respected.\n\nAhmad also said that Buhari\u2019s fear that state police might be abused by state governors did not hold water, adding that there is federal might to checkmate such abuses.\n\nOn the release of agitators, NEF Spokesman cautioned Buhari to allow judicial process has its way, rather than heating the already tensed situation.\n\n\u201cThe worry now is the huge distance which appears to exist between the thinking and posit of the President and those of other Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThere is virtually unanimity on the need to restructure the country, even if the details may vary. To shut out a major issue like restructuring that could determine the future of the country is insensitive at best and contemptuous at worst.\n\n\u201cOn state police, if the President\u2019s objection is predicated on abuses by governors over local government assets, we have to ask what he has done to stop such abuses with his huge powers. In any case the country should work towards producing better quality of leadership at all levels so that our federal system is not held hostage to incompetence and corruption of elected leaders.\n\n\u201cOn the release of agitators, we have made our position very clear. The judicial process should be allowed to determine whether they are guilty of threatening our existence as a country or not, as well as their involvement in criminal activities.\n\n\u201cThere should always be room for political solutions, but they must not cause more damage that already exists,\u201d Baba-Ahmad said.\n\nAPC has jettisoned its campaign promises \u2013PANDEF, MBF, SOKAPU\n\nBy Vincent Kalu\n\nThe midweek television interview in which President Muhammadu Buhari spoke extensively on some contentious national issues, while fielding questions from his interviewers, have continued to attract reactions from across the country.\n\nNational President of PANDEF, Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, wondered why the president and his ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), would jettison what was a campaign promise on which they rode into power.\n\n\u201cIf after six years, going to seven, he came out to bluntly tell Nigerians that there is nothing like restructuring, it means they have to look for a saviour that would restructure Nigeria in some other party. Nobody can say, \u2018no\u2019 to restructuring because Nigeria can never have peace until it is restructured.\u201d\n\nNational President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, agreed with Essien when he mentioned the case of Katsina State taken out of then Kaduna State, which in terms of population is about one third of the state. Yet it was given 34 local governments areas while Kaduna has less than 30, he pointed out. \u201cThis thing happened all over the North and today, we base everything on local governments, whether it is primary elections, revenue allocations, etc. We are all watching; everything he does is being watched and assessed. In the South-West, why would Osun have about 30 or more local government areas? What is its population? There are some local governments that were made federal constituencies just to favour a section of this country.\u201d\n\nHe warned: \u201cThat is what created all these distortions, which has made Nigeria what it is. If we don\u2019t correct these things so that people will no more continue to use them to destabilise this country and to override the rest, we would continue to have problems.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nEssien who expressed his disappointment with the President\u2019s decision to veto the idea of state police, said: \u201cState police is one of the things that will restore peace to Nigeria. Nigerians should appeal to Mr. President to reconsider his stance on the issue.\u201d\n\nReacting, on the issue, Jonathan Asake, the National President of Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) said: \u201cLook at the banditry and terrorism going on in the North. If our hunters and vigilantes are supported and empowered, they will be able to flush them out. But the government of the day has not got the will to do that. Whether state police or not, the political will of the leadership is not there.\u201d\n\nOn the continuous call for the release of agitators, Essien and Pogu noted that if the President could allow political solution to be applied in resolving the issue of Boko Haram members who allegedly repented, by reintegrating some of them into the society and security forces, then what is good for the goose is good for the gander, in the case of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cOtherwise it might be construed that the President has special hatred for the South-East and the South as a whole. If the Boko Haram members are given amnesty and political solution, they are also murderers; so, it should apply also the Kanu,\u201d Pogu added.\n\nAsake lamented that whereas the Minister of Justice and Attorney General was quick to gazette the declaration of IPOB as a terrorist organization, he is only doing that of the bandits one month after, and tagged it a clear case of nepotism.\n\nAfenifere, YCE to Buhari: You\u2019re not being properly briefed\n\nFrom Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nFor restating his opposition to state police and restructuring, and for saying he would not consider any political solutions in the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), President Muhammadu Buhari has come under attack from the Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural and political organisation, Afenifere, and the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE).\n\nIn separate interviews with Saturday Sun on Friday, the two leading Yoruba groups contended that the statements made by Buhari during a recent interview, showed that he had either lost touch with reality, or he was not being properly briefed by people around him on the true situation of things in the country.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cIt\u2019s so sad that in spite of various advocacies that have been made, in spite of the appeals and agitations that have been made along this line, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria could still maintain the kind of stand he enunciated in his interview, because these are the areas where the solutions to the multi-various problems that Nigeria has, lie.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, also noted Buhari \u201cwas expressing his personal opinion and to my opinion, he has not been able to really see himself as combining his personal opinion with the headship of Nigerian state. So, one wonders if he is truly really very patriotic, as some of us have held him to be.\u201d\n\nOn restructuring, Afenifere stated that: \u201cThere is no way Nigeria can do without restructuring. So, it is a pity that Mr. President has not seen that.\u201d But YCE is pushing for a new constitution for the country, saying the 1999 constitution is a fraud and that the 1963 and 1958 Constitutions of Nigeria should be the way to go. He added that the new constitution would ensure restructuring of the country into a truly federal system.\n\nOlajide said: \u201cYou cannot compel us to live under a unitary system. In fact, I don\u2019t agree with restructuring because it really should be one of the byproducts of a new constitution. A new constitution is what will ease the problem of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nReacting to tBuhari\u2019s opposition to state police, Afenifere stated: \u201cBy saying no to state police, he is saying that Nigeria is no longer being run under a federal system because state police is a component of the federal system of government, which means each layer of government, federal, state and local should have their own security outfits. When I was growing up, I knew native authority police (akoda) of the native council, which is an equivalent of local governments today. It made taking care of security at the local level easier.\u201d\n\nBut for YCE, Olajide said: \u201cThere is no country in the world as diverse as Nigeria that has a centralized police system. One, Nigeria is made up of different ethnic groups with different culture, history, habits, backgrounds and religions. When you are bringing different people together to form a country, they must sit down to agree on the basis of their union. That is what gave birth to the United States in 1776. The 13 colonies had to sit together to agree on powers to be ceded to the centre and the powers that each of them would hold in the federating units. So, you cannot run Nigeria as under a unitary system of government and unitary system of security.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of no political solution to free self-determination agitators like Nnamdi Kanu and Chief Sunday Adeyemo, better known as Sunday Igboho, everything about that issue is political. For the president to say there is no political solution, it means he is not been realistic. He is not in touch with reality because the whole issue is political. This is giving us an impression that those who surround the president are not briefing him properly for him to be in touch with reality.\n\nAnd, through their spokesman, the Yoruba elders noted: \u201cThere is no where in the world where any president rules out political solution to a problem. Even, people who committed murder, they were granted amnesty after some time in incarceration. For me, such a blanket statement is misplaced. Igboho did not breach any of the Nigerian laws. He was exercising his fundamental human rights. He expressed his opinion that he wants his people to go with him to a separate country. It was his opinion. In United Kingdom, it happens that citizens can abuse the Prime Minister and nothing will happen. We never heard that Igboho killed anybody anywhere. So, for Igboho, it has to be a political solution. Though I don\u2019t know much about Nnamdi Kanu, the president cannot rule out political solution. It was not a mischief, but a misplaced statement.\u201d",

          "text": "*Say date in February still possible as 5 disgruntled members beg Abuja court for restraining order\n\n*Party set to deal with recalcitrant followers\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja, Charles Ajunwa in Lagos\n\nThe Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have summoned an emergency meeting in Abuja tomorrow to pick a date for the party\u2019s National Convention, in line with the advice of President Muhammadu Buhari that the party should put its house in order to avoid being kicked out by the opposition in 2023.\n\nThe Chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, who disclosed this yesterday after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, said \u201cthe party is still hopeful that a date in February is still feasible for the convention\u201d during which new national officers of the party would be elected.\n\nIn a related development, five aggrieved members of the APC have commenced legal action in Abuja, seeking an order to stop the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, from going ahead with the convention. This is the latest in the series of court cases rocking the party.\n\nLalong said the President\u2019s warning to the party that it risks losing power to the opposition, including the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), was a signal to the APC to have a seamless convention \u201cso that it will not disintegrate.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the President\u2019s warning was for the party to redouble its efforts and do the needful.\n\nLalong said: \u201cYou know when convention is coming, there will be fears here and there. Some people will tell you it will work,some will say it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday. By Sunday, we will tell you when we\u2019re holding the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think during our first date before Christmas, we said we\u2019re going to do the convention in February and we are still working on it. As far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThe President was raising his fears, but we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election. Some parties have done their own; the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from doing its own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, are also telling the governor\u2019s please do more, and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to keep our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss, but I\u2019m not drawing conclusion, but I always tell you that a political party is about interests, the interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\u201d\n\nLalong further assured that the meeting scheduled for tomorrow would address all the contending issues affecting the conduct of the convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.\n\n\u201cBut I just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonise all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping; that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss, I have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party, because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from this present government.\u201d\n\nOn whether the several court cases pending against the party and its leadership will not abort plans of the convention, the governor said: \u201cThere are procedures for holding court processes. Many of the court processes were there when we set up the caretaker committee, but up to this moment, if you go to take a census of some of the court proceedings, you will realise that a lot of them have been resolved out of court. So, it\u2019s still the duty of the party, it\u2019s still part of the functions of the party to resolve.\n\n\u201cBut we must not wait to resolve all court processes before you go to the convention. I don\u2019t think so because there are also machineries for resolving court processes, even after convention. I had a court process in my state, that did not stop me from going on and at the end of the day, we resolved the court process and we\u2019re still going on, preparing and waiting for convention.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC would meet the speculated February 5 date for the convention in view of the need for mandatory 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Lalong said \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the chairman of the convention committee, but I want to assure you that we\u2019ve called a meeting for Sunday and if there is a meeting on Sunday, and you\u2019re thinking about next Friday. Just wait and see what will happen before next Friday. I don\u2019t want to draw conclusions now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already talking of litigation, you draw conclusions, somebody will go and file a case tomorrow. So, I don\u2019t want us to draw a conclusion on that, but I want to assure you that we are meeting. We already sampled the minds of many of the governors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019re going to get a date and then with the admonition given by the President, it\u2019s a warning signal to all of us to sit up and ensure that we have a seamless, very clean, fair and transparent convention so that our party will not get disintegrated.\u201d\n\nAggrieved Members Move to Stop Convention\n\nFive aggrieved members of the APC yesterday commenced legal action to stop the planned National Convention of the party by dragging the CECPC, under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, before a Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe aggrieved members want the court to issue an order restraining the Buni-led CECPC from going ahead with the convention.\n\nRecall that some members of the APC are clamouring for a change in date of the scheduled national convention.\n\nThe suit dated January 4, 2022, has as plaintiffs, Suleiman Usman, Muhammed Shehu, Samaila Isahaka, Idris Isah and Audu Emmanuel.\n\nThe APC, Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were listed as 1-3 defendants in the court processes.\n\nThe plaintiffs are praying the court for an order to stop the convention on the grounds that state congresses are yet to be completed in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nLawyer to the plaintiffs, Olusola Ojo raised five questions for the court to determine and also sought eight declarative reliefs.\n\nOne of the reliefs included \u201can order of this Court restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants from organising and conducting the national convention of the 1st defendant unless state congresses of the 1st defendant were first concluded in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\u201d\n\nAPC Set to Deal With Erring Members\n\nWith the National Convention of the APC being threatened by a plethora of crises, the ruling party may have resolved to come down hard on some erring members to ensure discipline and position the APC to retain power in 2023, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAPC\u2019s planned disciplinary actions are said to be fully supported by President Buhari who wants to leave behind a peaceful and united party in 2023.\n\nAccording to the President, the ruling party would shoot itself in the foot if \u201cit fails to resolve the disunity and lack of agreement amongst members of the party.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the decision of the party to sanction some erring members is in tandem with the President\u2019s position to instill discipline within the party.\n\nA source close to the APC National Secretariat in Abuja, who preferred anonymity, said the APC was considering \u201cvery serious and severe disciplinary measures against some people whose activities and utterances are threats to the health of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source adds: \u201cI can tell you categorically that the party is coming down heavily on some party members whose actions are becoming dangerous for the unity of the party. Some of the individuals involved are high-profile.\n\n\u201cI am aware of two governors that have been pencilled down for disciplinary action. One is from the North-west while the other is from the South-west. The governors are said to be throwing stones at the party through their agents. Also, two former governors who are working against the APC secretly have been identified and will be sanctioned at the appropriate time. Also, some Senators and House of Representatives members are fingered in a secret report at the disposal of the party.\n\n\u201cA minister from the South-east was also said to have been working against the interest of the party. The party may soon unmask these characters and deal decisively with them.\u201d\n\nThe source further said \u201ca meeting will be scheduled shortly to address this matter.\u201d\n\nAccording to insiders at the party\u2019s headquarters, the desperation of some individuals, especially aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the party, and groups within the APC remain a big threat to the peace and stability of the party.\n\nAnother highly ranked member of the party, who does not want his name mentioned, wondered why some aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the APC want to \u201cderail the party at this critical period instead of helping to build it and consolidate on the gains so far achieved by the Buhari government.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThere has to be APC first for these aspirants to realise their aspirations. APC is a big family and it has the capacity to accommodate all interests. Buni is working tirelessly to hold the party together and he needs the support of every stakeholder in order to take the party to greater heights. Buni is not contesting for the party\u2019s chairmanship seat. He will be seeking reelection in Yobe State as second term governor.\n\n\u201cSome political parties have predicted that APC will implode. But I have good news for them \u2013 APC will never implode. It\u2019s one united family. We have internal mechanisms we use in settling matters with dispatch. APC is the party to beat in 2023.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a group within the APC called Progressive Initiative For Change and Development has called on the leadership of the APC to ensure all crises in the party are resolved amicably before any National Convention is conducted.\n\nThe National Coordinator of the Group, Chief Donatus Okereke told journalists in Abuja that the party was clearly not ready for a National Convention with the crisis engulfing some state chapters, urging the national leaders of the party to ensure \u201cproper and thorough reconciliation\u201d before any National Convention is staged.\n\nPGF DG Calls for Buni\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Director General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Lukman Salihu has called on Buni and the Secretary of the party\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe to resign honourably if they can\u2019t conclude preparations for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nLukman stated this in a letter dated January 5, 2022 titled, \u201cAPC National Convention: Urgent Matters for the Survival of APC,\u201d and addressed to the Chairman of PGF and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State.\n\nThe director-general also copied President Buhari and key party leaders in the letter which was sighted by THISDAY.\n\nLukman recalled that on Monday, January 3, 2022, he sent an open letter to all APC leaders titled \u201cPlausibility of February 2022 APC Convention\u201d, which highlighted some of the reasons the APC National Convention should not be postponed.\n\nThe party chieftain pointed out that leaders of the party must understand that the survival of the party was at stake and any attempt to continue to contemplate postponement of the Convention means gambling with the future of the party, which he said was unacceptable.\n\nThe party chieftain said the failure of the Buni-led Committee to implement decisions makes APC leaders complicit and therefore agreeable to acts that are injurious to the survival of the party.\n\nAccording to him, the insinuation in the public is that the reluctance of Buni to proceed with implementation of the decision to hold the APC National Convention on February 5, 2022 as agreed was because governors want to continue to control the party, which to the best of my knowledge is not true.\n\nLukman stressed that some commentators both within the party and in the public have argued that there are deliberate efforts to prevent the convention from holding on February 5, 2022, which was why the CECPC did not make any public announcement or begin to make any preparation.\n\nThe director-general said that APC leaders should imagine the consequences of ruining the electoral potentials of the party in 2023 such that beyond losing the federal government, self-implicated legal challenges are created to weaken the electoral prospects of the party simply because of actions or inactions of the CECPC, especially Buni and Akpanudoedehe.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has mandated the Board of the newly incorporated Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, to ensure that the firm focuses on profitability and operates at par with its industry peers across the world, \u201cwhile acting as enabler company that will foster the development of other sectors of our economy.\u201d\n\nInaugurating the Board chaired by Senator Margery Chuba Okadigbo, at the State House, Abuja yesterday, the President also charged them to ensure that NNPC strictly complies with Corporate Governance principles that place premium on doing business with the highest ethical standards, integrity, and transparency.\n\nBuhari said: \u201dThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited is mandated to focus on profitability and continuous value creation beyond the simple fulfilment of legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n\u201dNNPC Limited is expected to operate at par with its industry peers across the world, while acting as Enabler Company that will foster the development of other sectors of our Economy.\n\n\u201dThe inauguration of this Board is a major step in the ongoing transition to a more viable petroleum industry that will attract investment to support our economic growth and generate employment to millions of our people\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201dI expect the NNPC Limited to be mindful of our commitments to net carbon zero aspirations and to ensure total alignment with the global energy transition realities.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari reminded the Board members that they came on board sequel to the reforms put forward by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, which seeks to reposition the Nigerian petroleum industry to a commercially viable and competitive industry in line with global business dynamics and best practices.\n\nThe President directed that there should be full alignment and synergy between NNPC Limited, the Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority in compliance with the provisions of the law in all respects to deliver the onerous reforms envisaged for the energy industry.\n\nWhile thanking the leadership and members of the National Assembly for their seamless support in the journey towards a viable, accountable and transparent energy industry, the President said he would count on the professional insights and ethical conduct of the Board members to ensure the delivery of his administration\u2019s promises to Nigerians.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said under the present administration a lot had been achieved in the petroleum industry, including the signing of the PIA, the registration of NNPC Limited as a CAMA company and the inauguration of the Board of the NNPC Limited.\n\n\u201dMr. President, this is history in the making because this is the first time any President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is inaugurating an independent board of an independent NNPC Limited. This, however, puts a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of those inaugurated and those of us in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nApart from the Chairman, Senator Okadigbo, other members of the Board inaugurated include Mele Kolo Kyari, Chief Executive Officer; Umar I. Ajiya, Chief Financial Officer; Dr Tajudeen Umar (North East); Mrs Lami O. Ahmed (North Central) and Mallam Mohammed Lawal (North West).\n\nOthers are Engr.

How do we keep them from enlisting in violent groups and gangs of kidnappers? A not-well managed cluster of population is frightening.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be a solution. Political will and political action can make the population an asset. This is the master key. The key has the will and the action. It is not enough to shout political will in mere political rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe former president also said there was an index that countries could use to enhance their populations and make it an asset.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to introduce the population and assets responsiveness index, just as UN, AU and other international agencies have established indices for comparing performance of countries,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some political bigwigs in the ruling All Progressives Congress have started perfecting their plot of manipulating the party\u2019s primaries and 2023 general elections by nominating proxies to President Muhammadu Buhari to be made electoral commissioners, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters further learnt that the stooges planted by the cabals in the country's electoral agency, the Independent National Electoral Commission, had already been approved by Buhari, who was not diligent to be aware of the grand plot to manipulate the electoral process.\n\nReliable sources confided in SaharaReporters that the regional gladiators within the APC had concluded plans to capture the party's primary elections and have the process rubber-stamped by the INEC officials after deceiving the President into accepting their proxies as nominees for the electoral umpire.\n\n\n\n\"It is a preliminary strategy to ensure that when the APC gladiators conduct primary elections in their zones, they will have the outcome rubber-stamped by INEC officials who are now nominated as national commissioners that will supervise the zones and erect a solid foundation against any possible legal challenge.\n\n\n\n\"This power bloc with vested interests within the APC are bent on eliminating from INEC individuals of proven integrity who can frustrate their plans. That is why they have allotted slot of commissioners nominees shared among themselves to their proxies for the success of APC members, a trap that President Buhari who is not diligent has fallen into,\" an top insider in the APC revealed.

          "text": "Some Senior Advocates of Nigeria have said that President Muhammadu Buhari should be ready to account for his actions when he leaves office next year.\n\nTheir views came as a response to the President\u2019s statement during his interview on Channels Television on Wednesday where he said that anybody who asked him to come and give any evidence in any court when he leaves office would be in trouble because he already made sure all important issues are on record.\n\nPresident Buhari\n\nAsked by his interviewers what comes to his mind about 2023 elections, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my problem.\u201d\n\nAsked further if he had no interest in who succeeds him, he said, \u201cNo, let him come whoever it is. All important things I made sure are on record.\n\n\u201cNobody should ask me to come and give any evidence in any court, otherwise, whoever it is would be in trouble because all important things are on record. I made sure about that. Important issues are all on record.\u201d\n\nBut in their separate reactions, Senior Advocates of Nigeria including Femi Falana, Ifedayo Adedipe, Mike Ozekhome and Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa said the constitution does not give immunity to former presidents and so Buhari should be ready to be questioned when he leaves office.\n\nFalana said he believed Buhari was misquoted in that part of the interview, noting further that the orders that could not be enforced against him at the moment because of his immunity would be enforced when he leaves office.\n\nHe stressed that the President would be called to account locally and internationally.\n\nMaking reference to a recent report by The Guardian titled, \u2018BPP kicks against award of ICTN contract to medical firm\u2019, the lawyer said while still in office enjoying immunity from prosecution Buhari was already being indicted by a Nigerian Government agency.\n\nFalana also made reference to several court judgments secured by an anti-corruption group, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, against the Buhari regime.\n\nHe said, \u201cRight now, he (Buhari) is already being called upon to give account not to talk of after he leaves office. These orders are going to be enforced.\n\n\u201cMore accountability cases are likely to be filed between now and 2023 and thereafter. In view of the avalanche of petitions alleging extrajudicial killings by security forces, the Special Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is likely to open investigations that may implicate top officials of the Federal Government.\n\n\"While he is still in power, even the BPP is indicting him. People have gone to court to say, \u2018You and (Rotimi) Amaechi can\u2019t award this contract.\u2019 Now he enjoys immunity; when he is out of office, he won\u2019t enjoy any immunity. So, he should be expecting to be called upon to give account. And if the records are there, he will have to come forward to present the records. Those records are not in the public domain.\n\n\u201cMany of the times you request for information under FOI (Freedom of Information Act), they won\u2019t reply. So, how can he say the records are there?\u201d\n\nFalana added that if nobody was in trouble \u201ceven now that he (Buhari) is in office enjoying immunity and has all the forces, instruments of oppression and intimidation and people are suing him, demanding accountability, when he is no longer in power, his immunity would have expired, so he could be called to account (for his actions) locally and internationally\u201d.\n\nAdegboruwa expressed discontent with the President\u2019s comment, describing it as an attempt to blackmaik this successor in office even though his immunity, according to Section 308 of the constitution, ends upon the expiration of his tenure.\n\nHe said,\u201d What the President has said is purely emotional blackmail and is using style to threaten his successor, which is unexpected of a President that claims to be fighting corruption. The person fighting corruption cannot himself be running away from investigation or probe because that would be inconsistent with the President\u2019s open declaration to be ahead in anti-corruption fight.\n\n\u201cThe immunity granted to him is limited while in office, and once he concludes his tenure he can be arrested, like every other citizen. There is no law that protects an ex-public officer from being summoned by the court to give evidence or account of their tenure. Under section 6 of our constitution, the courts are given the right and power to exercise jurisdiction over any citizen, and once the President completes his tenure in 2023, he should be expecting that a lot of times, he would be summoned to account for his tenure; the railway project, Chinese loans, humongous amount spent on electricity and we are only getting darkness and a lot of things the President has to account for, so he should be ready. As a matter of fact, he should be ready.\u201d\n\nAdegboruwa noted that in the countries Nigeria copied its democracy from, some presidents had had to waive their immunity to be probed.\n\n\u201cI think if the President has nothing to hide, he should be the first person to attend court if there is any matter that seeks to interrogate his tenure in office.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to agree that he does not want to be held accountable, of course he can be compelled to appear in court after his tenure ends. He can be summoned, the law of evidence permits that, and the constitution does not extend the immunity to after office,\u201d he added.\n\nFurther commenting on the issue, Ozekhome described the President\u2019s statement as a display of impunity and disregard for the rule of law.\n\nHe said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari loses his immunity enshrined in section 308 of the 1999 constitution by May 29, 2023. He becomes an ordinary citizen liable to be subpoenaed to \u2018answer any questions\u2019 from any court of law. He can never run away from it.\n\n\"He said all important things are on record. It\u2019s all well and good. But where clarifications or evidence are required, he is subject to being invited like any other citizen to come with answers.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he is more obligated than other citizens because he is the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This kind of statement shows a mindset of disdain for the rule of law and due process. It is not acceptable at all. I humbly condemn it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 83-year-old Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Robert Clarke, said the President had the impetus to say such because no former Nigerian President had been questioned after leaving office.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a tricky situation. Normally if a President resigns or leaves office and does many things wrong, the succeeding government can call him to come and account for what he did while in office but because it has not happened maybe that is why the President is feeling that way.\u201d",
          "summary": "Some Senior Advocates of Nigeria have said that President Muhammadu Buhari should be ready to account for his actions when he leaves office next year.\nFalana also made reference to several court judgments secured by an anti-corruption group, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, against the Buhari regime.\nHe said, \u201cRight now, he (Buhari) is already being called upon to give account not to talk of after he leaves office.\nThere is no law that protects an ex-public officer from being summoned by the court to give evidence or account of their tenure.\nHe said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari loses his immunity enshrined in section 308 of the 1999 constitution by May 29, 2023.",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, the highest grossing nollywood movie in 2021 and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven to a casual observer, 2021 was a massive year for the African tech ecosystem. It was the year when there were more disclosed funding rounds than we could keep up with. Data from various sources show that startups on the continent received over $4 billion from investors in 2021. That represents more than double the investments gotten in 2020.\n\nNumbers, they say, don\u2019t lie, and with help from Briter Bridges\u2019 Africa Investment Report 2021 and data from Africa: The Big Deal, we\u2019ll be extracting some insights.\n\nFunding for women-led startups needs to be better\n\nMuch has been written about the near absence of financing for women-led startups. While startup funding continues to grow, it is still disproportionately skewed towards startups led by men or at least one man on the founding team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdunayo Eweniyi, Co-founder, FirstCheck Africa\n\nThe Big Deal reports that only 0.95% of the funding raised by African startups went to startups founded or led by a woman. While this percentage is less than that of 2020 (2%), it is partly explained by the fact that funding raised in 2021 was 2.5x more than 2020\u2019s figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that while the total amount raised by women is increasing, the percentage of funding going to startups founded or led by women is on the decline from 4% in 2019 to 0.95% in 2021.\n\nTo be fair, women worldwide have a harder time raising money than men, and with Africa\u2019s startup scene in its early stages, that is to be expected. However, more can and should be done to fund African startups founded by women. Fortunately, it seems more investors are willing to do this with firms like FirstCheck Africa providing funds for female founders.\n\nFintech reigned supreme\n\nAs has been the case in the last few years, fintech startups received the bulk of funding in 2021. According to Briter Bridges, 62% (~$2.9 billion) of total funding in African startups went to fintech startups, double the 31% recorded in 2020.\n\nHealthtech and Biotech follow closely at 8%, with logistics (7%), education (5%), and cleantech (5%) rounding up the top five sectors by investment value. With payments still posing a problem for businesses and individuals, fintech looks set to retain its place as a preferred destination for investment in Africa for a while.\n\nFour countries still dominated\n\nJust like fintech and men dominate funding received, the Big Four \u2013 Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya \u2013 still dominate Africa\u2019s funding scene. For example, Nigeria alone accounts for a whopping $1.5 billion of the total funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax AB, an Egyptian eCommerce startup raised a $55 million Series A across two rounds in 2021.\n\nOne country that is worth talking about is Egypt. With 562 active tech startups, it sits behind only Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya as the countries with the most startups in Africa. Startups in the country also showed significant growth in terms of the amount of funding they received. However, Briter Bridges\u2019 report shows a growing interest in Francophone Africa, inspired, perhaps by Wave\u2019s unicorn status.\n\nMore $100+ million deals\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear of deals exceeding $100 million in Africa. Even when they happen, they are often mergers and acquisitions, but 2021 saw the highest number of $100+ million deals ever. There were 12 deals worth at least $100 million, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total funding value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSome startups that raised at least $100 million include Andela, $200 million Series E; Flutterwave, $170 million Series C; Chipper Cash, $250 million Series C across two separate rounds; OPay, $400 million Series C; Trade Depot, $110 million Series B; and Jumo, $400 million led by Fidelity Management & Research Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign investments dominate, but local investors stepped up.\n\nSo far, foreign investors still dominate funding for African startups. Briter Bridges reports that the United States and the United Kingdom lead the way. In Africa, South Africa and Mauritius are the top two countries where local investors have their headquarters. Asian investors are not left out with growing interest from Singaporean, Chinese, and Japanese investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nHowever, local African investors are increasingly stepping up activities. In 2021, several African investors threw their hats in the ring or raised new funds. Some of these investors include Ventures Platform, Savannah Fund, FirstCheck Africa, LoftyInc Capital, and Flat6Labs.\n\nOn a lighter note, some of the things that stand out include the fact that about 43% of startup founders have their alma mater on the continent. I may be reaching, but I believe this helps them tap into a wider network when raising money for their startups, considering most of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from outside the continent. However, it is also a reminder that Africa\u2019s education system still has a long way to go before it catches up with its Western counterparts.\n\nWith the heights reached by African startups in 2021, it is logical to expect them to be matched and hopefully eclipsed in 2022. Only time will tell, but 2022 looks set to see more growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\n2022 predictions for the fintech industry\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s Clubhouse-like platform\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2m fund\n\nWhat does 2022 hold for the fintech industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, Africa has seen rapid growth in the fintech industry. In 2021, for instance, approximately $5 billion was raised by startups across the continent. Interestingly, this exceeded 2020\u2019s investment and is almost four times what was raised five years ago. This demonstrates how much the fintech space has evolved in recent years.\n\nMoreso, the fintech industry is reshaping and simplifying our lives. Who would have predicted a decade ago that Point of Sale (PoS), and mobile and Internet banking would be a part of our everyday lives?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2021 was a great year for fintech startups, 2022 could hold more. What do you think? We don\u2019t know what 2022 will bring, but we can see the future by looking into the past.\n\nHere\u2019s Emmanuel Paul\u2019s take on that: Nigerian fintech predictions for 2022: Dollar exchanges go the way of Bitcoin.\n\nPlease read and leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nLinkedIn to launch a Clubhouse rival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn, a professional network service, is launching a new events platform to list, host, and market interactive, virtual live events. It will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end without the need for any other third-party software.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means users can record and run the event directly from LinkedIn, featuring tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and moderate discussions. Attendees can also communicate with each other during and after events.\n\nThe new events platform will begin with an audio-only product \u2014 clubhouse-style audio events \u2014 released in beta this January. This will follow a video version that will be released in March 2022. However, it will be targeting users who use LinkedIn to connect with a larger audience.\n\nHave we seen this before? This is similar to Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, but with content geared towards career development, professional topics, and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.\n\nRemember that LinkedIn shut down Stories in September 2021, partly because LinkedIn discovered that users didn\u2019t want disappearing videos. In addition, Twitter, a social media giant, discontinued Fleets, its Stories-like product, in 2021. Twitter discovered that users did not respond to short videos in the way they had hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2021, LinkedIn confirmed that it has been working on a Clubhouse rival to cultivate a larger and more active Creator community. Over the last year, the company has also been experimenting with other features that it may add to this events service, such as a paid, ticketed option which will be launched as a free service for the time being.\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce startup, JABU, has confirmed the closing of $3.2 million in seed funding to assist small retailers in ordering and stocking their products while also providing data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAfore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, among other unnamed investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nSuppliers who use the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators, and book merchandising. They can also run advertising and marketing campaigns, hold product giveaways, and generate merchandising revenue.\n\nIntriguingly, the company, which operates in three Namibian cities and has recently expanded into two Zambian cities, is planning a Series A fundraising round this quarter.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy 2022 Is the Year We Learn to Live With COVID-19.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 2021 was an amazing trip for Nigerian fintechs, then 2022 could be a blast off to space. That\u2019s how significant the exponential growth in the fintech space has been in recent years, and it creates room for bullishness in the space. But then, no one can see the future, and we can only use past experiences to gauge future expectations.\n\nFor instance, Nigerian fintech funding in 2021, $800 million, was 120% higher than funding in the last three years combined. Also, there are new dimensions to our understanding of fintech companies.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API fintech companies, which we examined closely. In 2021, we saw the launch of an open banking framework and lending companies deepen their tentacles in the Nigerian market.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what to expect, but for the fifth year running, Adedeji Olowe, a Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria, has made interesting predictions for the fintech space in 2022. While you can find the predictions on his website, our tradition for the past two years has been to give them relevant context and leave you with the caveat: No one can really predict the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom foreign exchange disruptions, expected acquisitions, and a new KYC king, here\u2019s a peek behind the curtains for Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions for 2022.\n\nThe market goes super-hot. New unicorns are born. Old players die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nIn 2021, Africa minted five unicorns, two of which were Nigerian fintech companies. With $800 million in fintech funding in 2021 and the CBN licensing new payment services providers, Olowe believes there will be heavy competition in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe market becomes competitive like crazy; fintechs would use dollars as weapons to snap talents and do marketing; larger and ballsy fintechs may start doing their APIs directly, bypassing Mono and others. When the smoke clears, the battlefield would be full of dead bodies,\u201d he declared.\n\nOlowe maintains that the aftermath of this battle would see new players crowned unicorns and any of the older players born before 2015 sink.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to reflect on here that hasn\u2019t been said already, but in these kinds of battles, the only clear winner is usually the customer. The only exceptions would be cases of companies using severely unethical practices to gain a competitive advantage. In this case, the media\u2019s watchful eye will be very important.\n\nA global giant comes to play; I will pay you with WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStripe came in 2020 to buy Paystack but not to play. But in 2022, my blurry eyes see a global player coming to play big time,\u201d Olowe says.\n\nThough Africa has witnessed much growth in recent years, most global tech giants do not take the African market seriously. But we began to see a shift last year, with Google playing a major role and launching a $1 billion fund to build giant subsea cables and fund startups, among others.\n\nLast year, we saw TechCrunch hire its first African reporter to increase its coverage of Africa. Also, in 2021, Apple appointed a country manager for Nigeria and Twitter opened its first African office. However, these moves do not show full intent to set up shop in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle and Apple stores are unavailable in Nigeria; PayPal still only allows Nigerians to send money. It appears the market is still too nascent for most prominent players, so why would a global fintech player come in?\n\n\u201cThe market is hot as hell; alternative payments methods, such as virtual accounts, have proven to be very successful. API players like OnePipe and Mono are doing very well and shipping data around like smugglers, and lastly, open banking would go live once the standards are approved by the CBN. There is simply no better time to be here,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHe\u2019s betting that WhatsApp comes back with payments and could build on their shaky launch in Brazil and India with a push for the African market.\n\nRecall that when WhatsApp launched its payment service in Brazil earlier in 2021, the country\u2019s central bank put a hold on things. It\u2019s unlikely that WhatsApp\u2019s payment play would be good news to existing banks and fintech players.\n\nConsidering how Paystack and Flutterwave helped trigger a wave of startups in Nigeria, would global players\u2019 entry into the Nigerian market open the doors to more big tech players in other sectors?\n\nVisa and Mastercard acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe made this prediction in 2021, and remains adamant that both moves make perfect sense for the two major incumbents of global payments services.\n\n\u201cNaira is at an all-time low, and Interswitch fundamentals are anchored on the naira, which makes them cheaper and because they are a grown-ass fintech, they can\u2019t enjoy the 20x EBITDA multiple that smaller and younger fintechs use for their valuation. But then, they are a behemoth, and they control 90%+ of ISO card traffic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSide note: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) multiples are used to calculate startup valuations, and it varies depending on the growth potential perceived in that industry. For instance, a tech company would have a higher EBITDA multiple than a manufacturing company because of the perceived growth potential.\n\nSo far, Mastercard has dominated more in Nigeria, and Olowe believes Visa\u2019s next big play would be to buy Interswitch. Considering Interswitch\u2019s influence, he insists that the only option is for Mastercard to acquire Visa.\n\nMTN launches PSB and blows everyone away\n\nTelco-led mobile money has not gained much traction compared to Kenya and Ghana. Nigerian telcos have struggled to get a banking licence from the CBN, and though 9mobile and Glo received theirs in 2019, other players like TeamApt and OPay have stolen the headlines.\n\nLeveraging a strong belief in the execution prowess of MTN\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, Olowe predicted that MTN would finally get a PSB licence in 2021, and it did, alongside Airtel.\n\n\u201cMTN would drive its PSB so hard and super agents so amazingly, they would quickly suck the oxygen out of the market. \u201cI expect a rapid decimation of Super Agents when MTN\u2019s PSB goes live,\u201d Olowe declared.\n\nOlowe\u2019s bullishness is not without good cause. He explains to Techpoint that MTN has a history of executing with surgical precision, aptly exemplified by their dominance of the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets.\n\nWith 73.6 million subscribers, MTN controls 38% of Nigeria\u2019s telecom market. But that\u2019s not the whole story. At its annual general meeting in September 2021, it announced that it had 88% nationwide network coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super curious about who Karl would anoint as the CEO of the bank, though; I smell some ex orange-coloured EDs who know all the tricks of the traditional banks and where dead bodies can be buried,\u201d Olowe mused.\n\nThe reference to ex orange-coloured executive directors seemingly points to Guaranty Trust Bank, with its orange-themed colours. But it\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nPer Olowe, MTN would also learn of the difficulties of working with two regulators, the CBN and the NCC, one of which is very strict.\n\nIn Ghana, MTN\u2019s mobile money dominance triggered legislative actions in 2020, to stem a monopoly. While that\u2019s a possibility in Nigeria, the market is way bigger and more competitive.\n\nFree transfers and realisation of financial inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the CBN implemented policies that reduced transaction fees for bank transfers, but nothing happened in 2021. For Olowe, this could either be a prediction or a wishlist, as he maintains that if it doesn\u2019t come to pass on its own, he will devote his energy to making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\u201cMake transfers below a certain amount free for everyone, and you have a good chance of bringing financial inclusion to every Nigerian,\u201d he argues, saying that \u201cThe last time the cost of transfer went down to \u20a610, the market jumped like drops of water inside hot oil.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, free transfers would largely benefit people with bank accounts and drive cashless adoption, but that might only be the starting point for financial inclusion. Credit and insurance remain big mountains to climb for financial inclusion, but free transfers would not hurt the vision at all.\n\nLending becomes hot; bigger banks jump in and get shocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by Lendsqr, a lending tech startup, Nigeria has a \u20a674 trillion lending gap across SME lending, asset, smartphone, laptop, education, vehicle, and mortgage financing. Despite the regulatory attention being directed towards unethical players, the space is still exploding.\n\nAs a result of this opportunity, Olowe holds that five of Nigeria\u2019s top ten banks would delve into the lending space without looking and, consequently, have disastrous experiences.\n\n\u201cThey will fail because their loans would be packed like corporate bank credits.\u201d\n\nOpen banking goes live. API players are shaken off the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API-fintech startups such as Okra, Mono, and OnePipe, which have all raised impressive amounts of funding. In 2021, the CBN launched an open banking framework, and Olowe believes it will go live in 2022.\n\n\u201cNow, open banking is significantly more comprehensive, faster, and safer than the APIs being sold. And because only licensed players would be allowed, the market may shake some old API providers out the way mobile Internet killed business centres,\u201d he argues.\n\nOlowe is a Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria and has been deeply involved in ensuring open APIs become a reality in Nigeria. If you\u2019re not sure how open APIs work or what an API is, check out the analogy in this piece.\n\n\u201cAPI fintechs are seen as the broker between two parties. How? By accepting messages from the sender, passing them as requests to the receiver, and returning data to the sender. Similarly, via API calls, users can request information from the broker at any time,\u201d reads an excerpt from our previous article.\n\nThough Olowe holds this position, Abdul Hassan, Mono CEO, maintains that API fintechs are building the infrastructure to enable open banking. There\u2019s more.\n\nIf you have any interest in fintech, then check out the two articles linked in this section and either keep a close eye on proceedings or become an active player yourself.\n\nNIN dethrones BVN. CBN\u2019s fear comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Bank Verification Number (BVN) is a unique identifier for every user of financial services in Nigeria. To date, there are over 51.8 million registered BVNs in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, citing the misuse of the BVN, the CBN clamped down on several fintech providers and limited access to the BVN. However, this move coincided with the resurgence of the National Identity Number (NIN), which had enrolled over 71 million people as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe NIN is increasingly becoming the digital identity of choice, but there are some question marks around its security.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is NIN being government property means data security and privacy may be poor. Soon, a major breach happens, and DSS is called to fish out fintech founders,\u201d Olowe surmised.\n\nDigital identity has been a significant problem for most Nigerian businesses, and while enrollments for the NIN are skyrocketing with the help of private companies, questions around security would have to be addressed. With the presence of VerifyMe and Youverify, there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about on this front in 2022.\n\nFX goes the crypto way. P2P FX transactions power investment apps. CBN is upset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2021, the CBN clamped down on several companies operating anything remotely connected to foreign transactions. It started in 2020. The naira\u2019s value was in free-fall against the dollar, and the country\u2019s apex bank was taking no prisoners as it dealt brutal blows to any party it deemed responsible.\n\nIt came after remittance services providers, mobile money operators, then it went after crypto startups, next was the investment tech startups, and soon after, FX platform, abokifx.com. With many Nigerians shopping online and interacting with several foreign websites, there\u2019s still pressure on the naira.\n\nOlowe believes that these clampdowns could lead to a P2P play by FX dealers, a move that saved the crypto space from regulatory scrutiny, for better or for worse.\n\n\u201cWhile some investment apps may have gotten an injunction to prevent CBN from locking their accounts up, trust them to throw a party if P2P can save their business model,\u201d Olowe stated.\n\nSo there you have it.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201cMy people perish for lack of knowledge\u201d says HOSEA.\n\nAs a journalist, writer and social scientist I have interacted with hundreds of politicians, public office seekers, academics, civil servants, clerics, critics and scores of other individuals in Edo State. My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality. The term \u201ccritique\u201d is used in the cover of the work to show no malice is intended in writing it. After all, all mortals on earth and institutions have their high and low points. Only God is perfect, does not err and is omniscient.\n\n5.OBASEKI: THREE YEARS ON THE SADDLE (NOVEMBER 12, 2016- NOVEMBER 11, 2019)\n\nIt contains the activities of Obaseki in the three years of his first tenure in office as Governor of Edo State. Obaseki relied on his performance during this period as a launch pad for his re-election September 19, 2020.\n\n6.FIRST TENURE: CONSOLIDATED DIARY OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nThis is a compendium of all the plans, programmes and projects either executed or proposed by the administration of Obaseki during the four years of his first, concluded tenure as Governor on November 11, 2020.\n\n7.MILESTONES OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a body of work which highlights the official accomplishments of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies under Obaseki during the first year of his second tenure in office as Governor.\n\n8.SECOND TENURE: FIRST \u2013 YEAR HARVEST OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a detailed summary of the activities of Obaseki Government that is self-sufficient in facts and information arranged in chronological sequence of occurrence. When you read through this work, you are educated about all that the administration did in the first year of its second tenure.\n\n9.Proposed Plans, Programmes And Projects Of Obaseki Administration (2021 Edition)\n\nThe work lists 68 items on the shelf of Obaseki government that are ongoing or awaiting execution as at the last quarter of 2021.\n\nLast Work: All these works are apolitical. Therefore, they are not sponsored by any individual, group or political party. Rather, the works were put together by a team of researchers who believe passionately in providing resources material with which Edo citizens and other interested persons can get relevant facts about Edo State Government.\n\nMICHAEL A.

          "text": "Lukman Otunuga\n\nStock markets are limping into Thursday\u2019s session in a frightened state after the minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting pointed to a faster than expected hike in interest rates.\n\nAsian stocks flashed red this morning following the heavy selloff on Wall Street overnight as hawkish signals from the FOMC minutes and spread of the Omicron variant sapped investor confidence. Gold has also found itself under pressure with prices struggling to keep above the psychological $1800 support level. In the FX space, the dollar appreciated as US Treasury yields jumped after the meeting minutes were released.\n\nGiven the market reaction to a more hawkish Fed, global equities certainly remain highly sensitive to increased rate hike expectations. With the US December jobs report around the corner, the atmosphere across the board could become tense and nervy as investors adopt a cautious stance. Whatever the outcome on Friday, the first trading week of 2022 has already kicked off with a bang.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the US non-farm payrolls\n\nAll eyes are now firmly focused on December\u2019s US jobs report which will be released on Friday. The pending data will be heavily scrutinised by investors for key insight into the health of the US labour market and wage growth.\n\nYesterday, the ADP Employment Report revealed that private sector employment surged by 807,000 in December. This figure smashed market forecasts and was a big jump from the 505,000 witnessed in November. Even though the ADP data is a poor predictor of the key non-farm payrolls report on Friday, markets may be readying themselves for a potential upbeat number. Consensus expects 425,000 jobs to have been created by the US economy last month, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.1% from 4.2%.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the US jobs report is being released at a time when the Fed has signaled interest rate hikes may be more aggressive than expected, amid concerns over soaring inflation. The March Fed meeting is now very much \u201clive\u201d with an 80% chance of an interest rate hike. The general consensus at the Fed also appears to be emerging that the maximum employment goal is now within reach, so NFP may play a big part in validating this thinking.\n\nShould the jobs report exceed market expectations, this is likely to boost confidence in the US economy and reinforce expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates in the Spring. Such a development may result in a stronger dollar while pressuring equity bulls and gold further. Alternatively, a massive payroll miss similar to November may raise questions over the health of the US economy and the Fed\u2019s ability to aggressively raise rates.\n\nCommodity spotlight \u2013 Gold\n\nA stronger dollar, hawkish Federal Reserve, and rising treasury yields make a poisonous cocktail for gold. The precious metal is under pressure on the daily charts with prices struggling to keep above $1800 as of writing.\n\nWhere the precious metal closes the week is likely to be heavily influenced by the key US jobs data on Friday. A strong report could cripple gold bugs, opening a path lower towards $1786 and $1770. Should $1800 prove to be reliable support, prices may rebound back towards the $1810 and $1831.\n\nLukman Otunuga is a Senior Research Analyst at FXTM\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

We showcase some of them:\n\nAlgeria\n\nDefending champions Algeria head the list of favourites after an impressive run in 2019 where they beat Senegal in the final.\n\nIn the qualifiers, they topped Group H with 14 points to book their ticket to Cameroon where they are drawn in Group E alongside another African giants Cote d\u2019 Ivoire.\n\nAlgeria have retained some of the players that did duty in Egypt. Led by the experienced captain Riyad Mahrez who is currently on fire in England for Premier League leaders Manchester City.\n\nThe Fennec Foxes have not been beaten since October 2018 and recently lifted the Arab Cup to further boost their confidence ahead of the 2021 AFCON.\n\nThey scored 25 goals in six World Cup qualifiers but they will have to be on the look out for Senegal who are looking to lift their first title after several attempts, including finishing as runners-up in the last edition of the tournament.\n\nSenegal\n\nThe Lions of Teranga marched into qualification without losing a match, registering four wins and two draws.\n\nWith the likes of Sadio Mane of Liverpool and Chelsea goal minder Edouard Mendy, they are surely one of the sides to watch in Cameroon.\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria is another nation that should definitely not be overlooked, having won the tournament three times in 1980, 1994 and 2013, including being losing finalists on five occasions.\n\nNigeria will head into the challenge with a new and interim manager in Augustine Eguavoen who will face the task of guiding the team to their fourth AFCON title.\n\nHe led the Super Eagles to third-place as a manager back at AFCON 2006.\n\nTherefore, the likes of midfielder Wilfred Ndidi, striker Kelechi Iheanacho (both of Leicester City), Everton\u2019s Alex Iwobi, Taiwo Awoniyi of Union Berlin and Frank Onyeka of Brentford will be looking to impress.\n\nThe West African giants open their campaign in Group D against seven-time champions Egypt on Tuesday.\n\nEgypt\n\nThe Pharoahs failed to lift the trophy on home soil in 2019 and the appointment of new coach Carlos Queiroz of Portugal could bring back the inspiration they need to win their eighth title.\n\nThey can also call upon one of Africa\u2019s biggest exports in captain Mohamed Salah who has been setting the scene alight in England for Liverpool.\n\nThey however did not do well in the Arab Cup recently and only managed to finish in third-place.\n\nBut they will surely be looking to put that performance behind them and focus on the business at hand.\n\nMorocco\n\nAnother side that has the nation in huge anticipation ahead of the tournament is Morocco.\n\nThe Atlas Lions have been in fine form over the last few months with a World Cup qualifying record of six wins in six matches, scoring 20 goals and conceding only one in the process.\n\nThat is a strong indication of a very well balanced team.\n\nIn spite of being without key players who have been omitted from the final squad, they are still a force to be reckoned with in the tournament.\n\nCote D\u2019Ivoire\n\nCote d\u2019Ivoire is another side not short of talents but who have failed to impress in recent times.\n\nThey will not be going to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after being knocked out and perhaps they could use that as motivation to do well in Cameroon.\n\nThe Elephants are one of the sides that boast of a large contingent of players based overseas and that experience could come in handy.\n\nThey have only lifted the trophy once, back in 2015.",

Abdulahi Adamu, disclosed their readiness to ensure fair hearing, equity and justice in carrying out their official exercise in the State.\n\nSpeaking during the courtesy call, the Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Abdulahi Adamu, said members of the party have come to attend to palpable contentious matters, treat petitions and elicit responses after which their report would be made in line with the directive of the authority of the party at the national level.\n\nHe said the Committee would be attending to petitions vis-a-vis complaints from the members of the party before coming up with its findings.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Mr. Governor for personally being available to receive us. We are the committee appointed and inaugurated sometimes in November last year to serve as members of the reconciliatory committee on issues that border on relationship and institutional matters.\n\n\u201cWe have done much on the northern states and we started that of Southwest on Thursday in Lagos. Yesterday, we were in Ogun State, and today, we are in Osogbo, the Osun State capital city.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of tradition and respect, when we go to a State like this, where our party is in power, we owe it a duty to pay courtesy on the Governor, because here (Government House) is our home, to announce and inform him we are in his land. That is what brought us here. After this, it is our intention to see what efforts had been made on those who petitioned. If they are identifiable, we want to meet with them.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting them, we will come back to our home to meet the Governor and our party so that if there is any allegation or accusation from the petition received, and after listening to the petitioners, we will listen to the responses in order to ensure fair hearing from all the parties involved.\n\n\u201cOur intention here is to maximize the opportunity of getting evaluation of relevant materials after which we will go to Abuja and sit as a committee and develop what we have in the report, which we will share with the authority of the party at the national level that appointed us.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are here for. Once again, we appreciate the solidarity and love you have shown to receive us. It is our hope that we will have the cooperation to succeed from you, the government and, of course, our genuine party members\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his response, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola assured the Committee of his Administration\u2019s absolute cooperation and support to carry out the exercise.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the composition and ability of the members of the Committee to dispense justice and ensure fair play throughout the exercise.\n\n\u201cI appreciate this visit and I thank you most sincerely for taking the trouble to come to us. No organization without issues, but what is important is to find possible way of reconciliation.\n\n\u201cWe will give you all the support, you will have the maximum cooperation expected of us. I welcome the idea of accepting petitions and finding solutions to all contentious issues.\n\n\u201cWe are peaceful people. Looking at the caliber of people that are involved in the Committee, I have no doubt that reconciliation is possible. The Chairman of the Committee had done so well when he served as Nasarawa Governor, ditto the other Governors in the Committee as well as other members of the Committee.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we are willing to give you all necessary support to make this a success. I hope you will enjoy the hospitality of our State. By any standard, we have not disappointed the party. Within the little we have, we have justified the confidence reposed in us\u201d, Oyetola added.",

          "text": "Former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has said a political solution is still being pursued concerning the case of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. The IPOB leader, who is facing charges bordering on terrorism and treason, is currently in the custody of the Department of State Services.\n\nSome Igbo leaders had last year visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the State House in Abuja to seek Kanu\u2019s release. This is amidst calls for a political solution to Kanu\u2019s case. During the visit, Buhari told them that an unconditional release of the IPOB leader runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nThis is as he stated in a recent interview with Channels Television that Kanu should defend himself in court for peddling false information about his regime while he was overseas.\n\nReacting, Ekweremadu, in an interview with Dream FM, Enugu, said he doesn\u2019t think Buhari ruled out a political solution to Kanu\u2019s case.\n\nThe Senator said, \u201cPolitical solution in the Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s matter is still very feasible. I also watched the Channels Television interview and I don\u2019t think Mr. President ruled out a political solution. In fact, I would have been surprised if he said he would just release Nnamdi Kanu because there is the independence of every arm of government, including the judiciary. There are procedures.\n\n\u201cI recall that it was exactly Mr. President\u2019s response when I led a delegation of the South-East Caucus of the Senate to see him on the Nnamdi Kanu issue in November 2016. But ultimately we kept reaching out and dialoguing until we had a political solution, which resulted in the judiciary granting Mazi Nnamdi Kanu bail because ultimately, everything will come to the judiciary because every arm of government is independent.\n\n\u201cSo, we will keep working on a political solution, nevertheless. We will keep engaging the government, just as we will continue to appeal to our youth and people to ensure the stability and prosperity of our region.\u201d\n\nHe said feedback is being expected from the government concerning the political solution being pursued.\n\n\u201cIn line with the political solution, which the southeast Caucus of the National Assembly is quitely pursuing, I led a delegation of some Igbo leaders like the Deputy Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Secretary-General, Amb. Okey Emuchay; and Bishop of the Methodist Church of Nigeria and Co-Chair Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace, Bishop Sunday Onuoha.\n\n\u201cAs usual, I deliberately didn\u2019t want to make it public because it is a quiet service we are rendering to Ndigbo and the nation. But the DSS eventually made it public in one of their statements. So, to answer your question, yes, I did lead a delegation to interface with the Kanu and the authorities. We had useful conversations. We have equally made some requests and we are waiting for feedback from the government to make progress,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Romelu Lukaku\u2019s row with Thomas Tuchel; Odion Ighalo\u2019s AFCON absence to Watford\u2019s eventual release of Senegal\u2019s Ismaila Sarr for the competition, sports fans had a lot to chew on in the first week of the year.\n\nOn First Eleven this week, we capture the stories that made headlines to help sports lovers make sense of an eventful seven days.\n\nAFCON Is Here!\n\nFinally, the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) is here! The competition, which was postponed last year, will begin in Cameroon on Sunday.\n\nSeveral clubs in Europe had criticised the timing of the competition as well as raised concerns over the rising rate of COVID-19 infections across the world, a development that triggered fears that the tournament may not hold.\n\nBut in his visit to the Central African country late last year, CAF President Patrice Motsepe, who met with Cameroonian authorities, said the biennial football showpiece will go ahead as planned.\n\nTo make this happen, a string of measures including a mandatory COVID-19 test for fans, and a limited crowd at the stadia, were introduced. Earlier in the week, Arsenal\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had contracted the disease and is a doubt for Gabon\u2019s opening game against Comoros on Monday.\n\nAside from concerns about the timing, security issues also appeared as a major stumbling block to Cameroon\u2019s hosting of the AFCON. Fears of attacks from separatists have led to the tightening of measures in the nation.\n\nEagles Land Without Ighalo\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Super Eagles arrived in Cameroon for the AFCON tournament but were without forward, Odion Ighalo. A post on the team\u2019s social media handles showed the players disembarking from the plane.\n\nIghalo\u2019s absence followed his club, Al-Shabab\u2019s refusal to release him for the competition, further compounding the woes of a country already missing star man, Victor Osimhen.\n\nCoach Austin Eguaveon, has, however, said there is no replacement for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) top scorer. Nigeria are in Group D alongside record winners, Egypt, Sudan, and Guinea Bissau.\n\nWatford Bow\n\nThe row over the release of players for the continental event did not only affect Nigeria. Senegal and Watford \u2013 the club which barred Super Eagles\u2019 Emmanuel Dennis from the competition \u2013 finally bowed to pressure from the Senegalese football authorities and released Ismaila Sarr to join his compatriots.\n\nSarr had been a doubt for the team with the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF) claiming the Premier League side blocked the release of the 23-year-old. The federation in describing the claim said it was a \u201cdisrespectful, pernicious and discriminatory behaviour\u201d from Watford. The club though dismissed the accusation.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s Ordeal Lingers On\n\nCOVID-19 is also raising more debates in the tennis world and Novak Djokovic continues to make headlines.\n\nThe Serb has repeatedly refused to confirm if he has taken the shots. He, however, got a medical exemption to participate in the Australian Open. Hours after the move, the Australian authorities denied him a visa to the country.\n\nAs expected, the development sparked outcry globally but the conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison maintained that \u201crules are rules and there are no special cases\u201d. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic waded into drama, describing it as a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d.\n\nOsaka Expect Fun-Filled Return\n\nAlso in tennis, Naomi Osaka is expecting fun on the court following her return from a four-month break! The four-time Grand Slam winner tearfully exited at the US Open in September.\n\nThe Japanese fell to 13 in the rankings and had said after her third-round defeat at Flushing Meadows that she was \u201cdealing with some stuff\u201d and was taking a break from the game!\n\nShe flew into Melbourne last week to prepare for her Australian Open defence.\n\nGuardiola Gets COVID-19\n\nIn England, COVID-19 cases have also continued to soar among Premier League teams. Manchester City coach, Pep Guardiola and his Burnley counterpart, Sean Dyche, tested positive for the disease.\n\nThe duo is now in isolation and Guardiola will miss the team\u2019s FA Cup trip to Swindon Town. Before then, the Carabao Cup tie between Arsenal and Liverpool was also moved due to the increasing number of cases in England. But other FA Cup games are expected to continue.\n\nMessi Tests Positive\n\nApart from Guardiola, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)\u2019s, Lionel Messi also tested positive to COVID-19. The seven-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner was one of four PSG players to contract the virus, according to the club.\n\n\u201cHe is constantly in contact with our medical service. When he is negative, he will be able to return to France,\u201d PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino told a press conference.\n\nLukaku Backtracks\n\nStill in England. Following the controversy generated by an interview with Sky Italia, Romelu Lukaku apologised to manager, Thomas Tuchel.\n\nThe Belgian star was in the news after he claimed he was unhappy at the Stamford Bridge side, claiming Tuchel had been playing him out of position for the Blues.\n\nHe was axed for the game against Liverpool and days after the encounter, the former Inter Milan forward, said he was \u201csorry\u201d over his comments.\n\n\u201cTo the fans, I\u2019m sorry for the upset that I\u2019ve caused,\u201d Lukaku told Chelsea\u2019s website. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s up to me now to restore your trust, and I\u2019ll do my best every day to show commitment on the training ground and in games to make sure we win games.\n\n\u201cAnd also to the manager, my teammates, and the board, I apologise, because I think it was not the right moment, also.\u201d\n\nAll Clear for Plumptre\n\nBack home, footballer Ashleigh Plumptre, formally switched her nationality to Nigeria after FIFA cleared her to play for the African nation.\n\nThe Leicester defender had indicated interest to represent the Super Falcons and last year played an unofficial game for the Nigerian side.\n\nSpokesman of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Ademola Olajire, confirmed the development, saying the former England youth international fast-tracked the move.\n\n\u201cIt was only possible because of her commitment and dedication. She made the federation\u2019s work a lot easier by providing all the requirements in quick time,\u201d Olajire told the BBC.\n\nFinidi\u2019s Honeymoon Over\n\nOn the local scene, George Finidi\u2019s Enyimba lost their second league game in a row on Sunday. The People\u2019s Elephant fell 2-0 to Kano Pillars in a Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) matchday 4 encounter.\n\nThe team earlier on suffered a 1-0 defeat against Rivers United, the first loss for the Aba-based side since Finidi\u2019s appointment. Enyimba had enjoyed a five-game unbeaten run before then. Matches continue this weekend in the league.\n\nMendy Granted Bail\n\nAway from Nigeria, Manchester City defender, Benjamin Mendy, was granted bail after four months in prison.\n\nMendy was granted bail by Judge Patrick Thompson at a private hearing at Chester Crown Court at a private hearing in a Chester Crown Court. But pressmen were barred from the hearing. He has been bailed until January 24 pending a further pre-trial hearing.\n\nThe Frenchman is facing a seven counts charge of rape and sexual assault and was held at the HMP Altcourse, Liverpool, from where he was transferred to HMP Manchester.\n\nHe was billed to go on trial this month but that has now been moved to June at the earliest.",

          "text": "Tigrayan rebels claimed Saturday that dozens of people had been killed in a drone strike on a camp for civilians displaced by the brutal war in northern Ethiopia.\n\nReports of the attack emerged just a day after the government declared surprise pardons for a number of detained opposition leaders, including senior Tigrayan figures, in what it said was a move to foster national reconciliation.\n\nThe amnesty has been welcomed by the international community as a possible way out of 14 months of brutal fighting between forces loyal to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the rebel Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF).\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement followed a dramatic shift on the battlefield, with the rebels retreating to their Tigray stronghold at the end of December in the face of a military offensive that saw government forces retake a string of strategic towns.\n\nREAD ALSO: Ethiopia Frees High-Profile Political Prisoners\n\nAlthough there appeared to be a lull in fighting since, the rebels have accused the government of continuing to conduct deadly drone attacks on Tigray.\n\nTPLF spokesman Getachew Reda said on Twitter that an attack on the camp in the northwestern town of Dedebit \u201chas claimed the lives of 56 innocent civilians so far\u201d.\n\nHis claim could not be independently verified, with access to Tigray restricted and the region under communications blackout, and there was no immediate response to requests for comment from Ethiopian government officials.\n\nHowever, a senior official at the main hospital in Tigray\u2019s capital Mekele told AFP that the hospital in the town of Shire where the victims were taken had reported 55 people dead and 126 injured.\n\nThe EU also briefly referred to the air strike in a statement Saturday, saying it had killed and wounded many civilians.\n\nEarlier this week the United Nations said three Eritrean refugees including two children had been killed in an air strike Wednesday on a refugee camp in Tigray.\n\nMixed messages\n\nThe conflict in Africa\u2019s second most populous country has killed thousands of people and created a deep humanitarian crisis in the north, with fears it could tear apart a country where ethnic tensions are never far from the surface.\n\nTigray itself is under what the UN calls a de facto blockade that is preventing life-saving food and medicine from reaching its six million people, including hundreds of thousands suffering famine-like conditions.\n\nWhile Friday\u2019s amnesty statement also spoke of national dialogue, it did not say if Abiy was considering any negotiations with the TPLF, the party that dominated politics for three decades until he took power in 2018 but is now considered a terrorist group by Addis Ababa.\n\nAbiy \u2014 a Nobel peace laureate who reportedly went to the battlefront in November to direct his troops \u2014 called for \u201cnational reconciliation\u201d and \u201cunity\u201d in a message for Orthodox Christmas.\n\nHowever, in another statement Saturday he lashed out at \u201cforeign and internal enemies\u201d and described the TPLF as \u201csnakes\u201d.\n\n\u2018Seize the moment\u2019\n\nThe amnesty coincided with a new peace mission to Ethiopia by US envoy Jeffrey Feltman, and was welcomed by the United Nations, the EU and the African Union, which has been spearheading efforts to end the conflict.\n\nAmong those pardoned were prominent politicians rounded up after deadly protests that erupted in mid-2020 over the killing of Hachalu Hundessa, a popular Oromo singer and activist.\n\nThey included Eskinder Nega, a veteran Amhara journalist and fierce government critic who has spent many years in prison under various administrations since 2005.\n\nAlso freed was Jawar Mohammed, a former media mogul and one-time Abiy ally, and his colleague in the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress, Bekele Gerba.\n\nIn all, 239 people were killed in the 2020 bloodshed that saw Abiy \u2014 who had himself swept to power on the back of anti-government protests \u2014 wrestling to keep a lid on the simmering ethnic tensions.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the TPLF stalwarts granted amnesty \u2014 including one of its founders Sibhat Nega and former Tigray president Abay Woldu \u2014 had been released by Saturday.\n\nThe fate is also unclear of thousands of people reportedly detained in sweeps that appeared to target Tigrayans under a wartime state of emergency declared in November.\n\nAfrican Union Commission chief Moussa Faki Mahamat described the amnesty as an \u201cimportant gesture\u201d and voiced hope it would pave the way for a \u201cgenuinely inclusive\u201d national dialogue.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also welcomed the release of the opposition leaders and the establishment of a National Dialogue Commission as \u201cpositive steps\u201d, but said the IDP camp strike showed the fighting was still going on.\n\n\u201cAll parties must seize the moment to swiftly end the conflict and enter into dialogue,\u201d he said.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The former head of Kazakhstan\u2019s counterintelligence and anti-terror agency has been arrested on charges of attempted government overthrow in the wake of violent protests that the president has blamed on foreign-backed terrorists.\n\nThe arrest of Karim Masimov was announced Saturday by the National Security Committee, which Kasimov headed until he was removed this week by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.\n\nAuthorities say security forces killed 26 demonstrators in this week\u2019s unrest and that 18 law-enforcement officers died. More than 4,400 people have been arrested, the Interior Ministry said Saturday.\n\nThe protests in the Central Asian nation were the most widespread since Kazakhstan\u2019s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe unrest began in the country\u2019s far west as protests against a sharp rise in prices for liquefied petroleum gas that is widely used as vehicle fuel, and spread to the country\u2019s largest city, Almaty, where demonstrators seized and burned government buildings.\n\nAt Tokayev\u2019s request, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russia-led military alliance of six former Soviet states, authorized sending about 2,500 mostly Russian troops to Kazakhstan as peacekeepers. Some of the force is guarding government facilities in the capital Nur-Sultan, which \u201cmade it possible to release part of the forces of Kazakhstani law enforcement agencies and redeploy them to Almaty to participate in the counter-terrorist operation,\u201d said a statement from Tokayev\u2019s office.\n\nTokayev said Friday that he had authorized security forces to shoot to kill those participating in unrest. On Saturday, there were no immediate reports of unrest in Almaty, but police dispersed a demonstration and made detentions in the city of Aktau, while sporadic gunfire was heard in Kyzylorda, the Russian agency Sputnik said.\n\nNo details were given about what Masimov, the security agency head, was alleged to have done that would constitute an attempted government overthrow. The agency, a successor to the Soviet-era KGB, is responsible for counterintelligence, the border guards service and anti-terror activities.\n\nAlthough the protests began as denunciations of the near-doubling of LPG prices at the start of the year, their spread and intense violence indicate they reflected widespread dissatisfaction in the country run by the same party for more than 30 years.\n\nMany demonstrators were shouting \u201cold man out,\u201d a reference to Nursultan Nazarbayev, who was president from independence until resigning in 2019 and anointing Tokayev as his successor. Nazarbayev, who was given the title Ebasy (leader of the nation), retained substantial power after resignation as head of the National Security Council.\n\nBut Tokayev removed him as council head amid the unrest, possibly aiming at a concession to mollify protesters. Nazarbayev remained invisible during the chaos, but on Saturday his spokesman said Nazarbayev is in the capital and \u201ccalls on everyone to rally around the President of Kazakhstan to overcome current challenges and ensure the integrity of our country.\u201d",

          "text": "Tennis world number one Novak Djokovic mounted his legal challenge on Saturday to being refused entry to Australia, saying he had immigration clearance to enter the country after contracting COVID-19 last month.\n\nOn his third day in immigration detention in Melbourne, the Serbian superstar\u2019s court filing confirms widespread speculation he had caught the coronavirus. It escalates a furore over Australia\u2019s handling of a medical exemption from the country\u2019s vaccination rules that has rocked world tennis.\n\nDjokovic, a vocal opponent of vaccine mandates hoping to win his 21st Grand Slam at the Australian Open, has been holed up since Thursday in a modest Melbourne hotel after his visa was cancelled due to problems with the exemption.\n\nThe drama has become a diplomatic issue, as Serbia says Australia is treating Djokovic as a prisoner. It has also become a flashpoint for opponents of vaccine mandates around the world.\n\nHis filing, ahead of a court hearing on Monday over his visa cancellation, says Djokovic had received the exemption from tournament organiser Tennis Australia, with a follow-up letter from the Department of Home Affairs saying he was allowed into the country.\n\n\u201cI explained that I had been recently infected with COVID in December 2021 and on this basis I was entitled to a medical exemption in accordance with Australian Government rules and guidance,\u201d Djokovic says in the filing about his experience being detained at Melbourne Airport.\n\nDjokovic says he told Australian Border Force \u201cofficers that I had correctly made my Australian Travel Declaration and otherwise satisfied all necessary requirements in order to lawfully enter Australia on my visa.\u201d\n\nDjokovic returned his first positive COVID-19 test on Dec. 16 but by Dec. 30 \u201chad not had a fever or respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 in the last 72 hours\u201d, the filing says. On Jan. 1, it says, he received a document from Home Affairs telling him his responses indicated he met \u201cthe requirements for a quarantine-free arrival into Australia\u201d.\n\nThe federal court has ordered Home Affairs to file its response by Sunday. The Border Force, a unit of Home Affairs, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Saturday.\n\nThe Australian Open starts on Jan. 17.\n\nMany countries allow a recent COVID infection as a reason for an exemption from vaccine requirements, but Australia\u2019s federal government released a letter soon after Djokovic arrived showing that it had notified Tennis Australia that was not necessarily the case in the country.\n\nThe federal and Victorian state governments and Tennis Australia have denied responsibility for the dispute.\n\nCzech player Renata Voracova, who was also detained in the same detention hotel as Djokovic and had her visa revoked after issues with her exemption, was seen by reporters leaving the hotel in a van on Saturday evening.\n\nHer destination was not immediately clear, but she told Czech media earlier that she was still waiting to leave the country after deciding not to appeal the decision.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s court filing confirms a media report that he asked to be moved to lodgings with access to a tennis court but that his request was denied. The Park Hotel, where he is staying, is also home to dozens of asylum seekers trying to enter the country.\n\nThe feted sportsman expressed \u201cshock, \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cconfusion\u201d when he was held overnight, and had a bed prepared near his airport interview room so he could rest while waiting until the morning when he would be able to reach legal representatives and Tennis Australia, the filing says.\n\nCustoms officers ultimately \u201cpressured\u201d Djokovic to undertake an interview before he had spoken to either, the filing says.\n\nTennis Australia said it never knowingly misled players and had always urged players to be vaccinated, after News Corp papers published a document from the organising body apparently advising players on ways to enter the country with a medical exemption from vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe have always been consistent in our communications to players that vaccination is the best course of action \u2013 not just as the right thing to do to protect themselves and others, but also as the best course of action to ensure they could arrive in Australia,\u201d Tennis Australia said in a statement quoted by local media.\n\n\u201cWe reject completely that the playing group was knowingly misled.\u201d\n\nTennis Australia\u2019s advice was based on the contents of a federal government website to which it had been referred by the federal health minister, the statement added.\n\nThe group\u2019s information sheet, as published by News Corp, said players could enter the country with an \u201coverseas medical exemption\u201d that had been \u201creviewed by an Australian medical practitioner\u201d then entered on a central database.\n\nThe document was distributed to players last month, News Corp reported. But the federal government released a letter showing it wrote to Tennis Australia in November saying that prior infection with COVID-19 was not necessarily grounds for exemption in Australia, as it was elsewhere.\n\nTennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley defended the organisation\u2019s actions, according to a video that emerged on Saturday.\n\nIn an address to Tennis Australia staff, uploaded to News Corp websites, Tiley said he would tell the full story about the saga but was constrained because Djokovic was challenging his visa cancellation in court.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve chosen at this point not to be very public with it and simply because there is a pending lawsuit related to entry into Australia,\u201d he said in the video.",

          "text": "Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Friday questioned the legality of President Joe Biden\u2019s pandemic-related vaccine-or-testing mandate for large businesses but appeared more receptive to his administration\u2019s vaccine requirement for healthcare facilities at a time of surging COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe court\u2019s nine justices, who are all vaccinated, heard more than 3-1/2 hours of arguments in two cases that test presidential powers to combat a raging public health crisis that already has killed roughly 835,000 Americans.\n\nThe conservative justices, who hold a 6-3 majority, signaled sympathy toward arguments by the state of Ohio and a business group that the federal workplace safety agency that issued the rule affecting businesses with at least 100 workers \u2013 a policy requiring vaccines or weekly COVID-19 tests for more than 80 million employees \u2013 overstepped its legal authority.\n\nThe challengers have asked the court to block the policy before the administration begins enforcement on Monday.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservatives suggested that the 1970 law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) did not authorize this type of broad emergency action.\n\nThey seemed more open to a separate federal vaccine requirement that states led by Missouri and Louisiana are asking the court to block nationwide. It covers an estimated 10.3 million workers at about 76,000 healthcare facilities including hospitals and nursing homes that accept money from the Medicare and Medicaid government health insurance programs for elderly, disabled and low-income Americans.\n\nThe conservative justices have shown skepticism toward sweeping actions by federal agencies in past rulings. Decisions in both cases are expected quickly.\n\nThe arguments underscored how divisive the issue of vaccination has become in the United States, as in many nations.\n\nThe three liberal justices indicated that both policies were justified during a pandemic showing no signs of abating, with an upswing in COVID-19 cases driven by the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant.\n\n\u201cThis is a pandemic in which nearly a million people have died,\u201d liberal Justice Elena Kagan said, referring to the U.S. death toll during arguments over the OSHA mandate. \u201cIt is by far the greatest public health danger that this country has faced in the last century. More and more people are dying every day. More and more people are getting sick every day. \u2026 And this is the policy that is most geared to stopping all this.\u201d\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh indicated that the OSHA rule could be invalid under a legal doctrine that says Congress must provide a clear statement on a specific issue in order for a federal agency to issue broad regulations on it.\n\nThe conservative justices suggested Congress or individual states would be better suited to act.\n\nRoberts voiced doubt that the law passed by Congress establishing OSHA empowered it to take such action.\n\n\u201cThat was 50 years ago that you\u2019re saying Congress acted. I don\u2019t think it had COVID in mind. That was almost closer to the Spanish flu than it is to today\u2019s problem,\u201d Roberts said, referring to the pandemic that occurred a century ago.\n\nThe White House has said the two temporary mandates will save lives and strengthen the U.S. economy by increasing the number of vaccinated Americans by the millions.\n\n\u201cI would find it would be unbelievable to be in the public interest to stop these vaccinations,\u201d liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said.\n\nSome justices raised the possibility of the court issuing a temporary stay blocking the OSHA rule while the court decides how to proceed.\n\nRoberts and Kavanaugh appeared more sympathetic to the Biden administration\u2019s arguments regarding the healthcare facilities mandate issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for administering those programs.\n\nKavanaugh noted that private healthcare providers did not challenge the mandate that states are contesting. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested the government could require vaccinations in certain facilities but not others.\n\nGorsuch seemed skeptical of the policy as a whole, questioning whether CMS has the authority to issue a vaccine regulation because such action affects an employer\u2019s staffing decisions, which Congress has said the agency could not do as part of its Medicaid and Medicare funding requirements.\n\nGorsuch said that \u201cyou cannot use the money as a weapon to control these things.\u201d\n\nAll the government is doing, Kagan said, is \u201cto say to providers, you know what, basically, the one thing you can\u2019t do is to kill your patients, so you have to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor participated in the arguments from her chambers. Ohio Solicitor General Benjamin Flowers and Louisiana Solicitor General Liz Murrill participated remotely by telephone. Flowers tested positive for COVID-19, his office said. Murrill\u2019s office said she acted in accordance with the court\u2019s COVID-19 protocols, which require lawyers to argue remotely if they receive a positive test.\n\nThe justices spent much of the pandemic working remotely before returning to in-person arguments in October, although the building remains closed to the public.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration asked the justices to lift lower court orders blocking the CMS mandate in half the 50 states.\n\nThe Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Dec. 17 lifted an injunction issued by another court that had blocked the OSHA rule, prompting challengers to ask the Supreme Court to intervene.",

          "title": "Arbery Killers Sentenced to Life in Prison; No Parole for Father, Son",
          "text": "Three white men convicted of murder for chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery were sentenced to life in prison Friday, with a judge denying any chance of parole for the father and son who armed themselves and initiated the deadly pursuit of the 25-year-old Black man.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley said Arbery left his home for a jog and ended up running for his life for five minutes as the men chased him until they finally cornered him. The judge paused for a minute of silence to help drive home a sense of what that time must have felt like for Arbery, whose killing became part of a larger national reckoning on racial injustice.\n\n\u201cWhen I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles. I kept coming back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores,\u201d he said, mentioning the neighborhood where Arbery was killed.\n\nGreg and Travis McMichael grabbed guns and jumped in a pickup truck to chase Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. Their neighbor, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael firing close-range shotgun blasts into Arbery.\n\n\u201cAhmaud Arbery was then hunted down and shot, and he was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands,\u201d the judge said. Walmsley ordered the McMichaels to serve life without parole and granted Bryan a chance to earn parole after serving at least 30 years in prison.\n\nA few dozen supporters cheered Arbery\u2019s family as they exited onto the courthouse steps Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cToday your son has made history, because we have people who are being held accountable for lynching a Black man in America!\u201d said Benjamin Crump, a civil attorney representing the family.\n\nMurder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison under Georgia law unless prosecutors seek the death penalty, which they opted against in this case. During the sentencing hearing, Arbery\u2019s family had asked the judge to show no lenience in deciding whether to grant an eventual chance at parole.\n\nArbery\u2019s sister recalled his humor, describing him as a positive thinker with a big personality. She told the judge her brother had dark skin \u201cthat glistened in the sunlight,\u201d thick, curly hair and an athletic build, factors that made him a target for the men who pursued him.\n\n\u201cThese are the qualities that made these men assume that Ahmaud was a dangerous criminal and chase him with guns drawn. To me, those qualities reflect a young man full of life and energy who looked like me and the people I loved,\u201d Jasmine Arbery said.\n\nArbery\u2019s mother said she suffered a personal, intense loss made worse by a trial where the defense was that her son had made bad choices that led to his death.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact. They chose to target my son because they didn\u2019t want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community,\u201d Wanda Cooper-Jones said. \u201cAnd when they couldn\u2019t sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him.\u201d\n\nThe sentences matched the recommendation of prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, who said all deserved the mandatory life sentence for showing \u201cno empathy for the trapped and terrified Ahmaud Arbery.\u201d\n\nContending the McMichaels still believed they didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Dunikoski disclosed Friday that Greg McMichael gave Bryan\u2019s cellphone video of the shooting to an attorney, who leaked it.\n\n\u201cHe believed it was going to exonerate him,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nThe McMichaels\u2019 defense attorneys argued that their clients deserved the possibility of parole because the killing was an unplanned, unintentional act. Bryan\u2019s lawyer said he showed remorse and cooperated with police, turning over the cellphone video of the shooting to help them get to the truth.\n\n\u201cMr. Bryan isn\u2019t the one who brought a gun,\u201d Kevin Gough said. \u201cHe was unarmed. And I think that reflects his intentions.\u201d\n\nBryan is 52, raising the chances that he will spend the remainder of his life in prison even with the chance of parole after serving 30 years.\n\nThe guilty verdicts against the men handed down the day before Thanksgiving prompted a victory celebration outside the Glynn County courthouse. In addition to murder, all three men were also convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Travis and Greg McMichael were each sentenced to an additional 20 years for aggravated assault.\n\nDefense attorneys have said they plan to appeal the convictions. They have 30 days after sentencing to file them.\n\nNext month, the McMichaels and Bryan face a second trial, this time in U.S. District Court on federal hate crime charges. A judge has set jury selection to begin Feb. 7. Prosecutors will argue that the three men violated Arbery\u2019s civil rights and targeted him because he was Black.",

How are we going to house them, educate them, provided we have security and other variants of security?\u201d\n\nHe said the second cluster of questions are: \u201cHow do we keep this large army of unemployed youths from exploding? How do we keep them from enlisting in violent groups and gangs of kidnappers? A not-well managed cluster of population is frightening.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be a solution. Political will and political action can make the population an asset. This is the master key. The key has the will and the action. It is not enough to shout political will in mere political rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe former president also said there was an index that countries could use to enhance their populations and make it an asset.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to introduce the population and assets responsiveness index, just as UN, AU and other international agencies have established indices for comparing performance of countries,\u201d he said.\n\nTHISDAY",
