made the recommendation in its proposed state fire service bill.\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Special Duties, Mr Raheem Kazeem representing Ibeju Lekki II, disclosed this at a one-day public hearing on the Bill yesterday.\n\nThe public hearing was conducted by the House of Assembly.\n\nThe Bill tagged, \u201cA Bill for a law to establish the Lagos State Fire And Rescue Service and for Connected Purposes\u201d, passed through a public hearing at the premises of the Lagos State House Assembly.\n\nAccording to the Bill, \u201cAny person or persons who obstruct, interferes with, assaults or resists any officer of the fire service in the course of the execution of his duty under a proposed fire service law or resist any such officer or service is to be fined the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Naira (N500,000.00) or sentence to a jail term of 2 years or both for an individual and Five Million Naira (N5,000,000.00) fine for a corporate body.\n\n\u201cIn addition, failure to yield right of way to engines or other mobile fire-fighting equipment as required by the law is an offence and on conviction, the accused shall be liable to a fine not exceeding One Hundred Thousand Naira (N100,000.00) or to a term not exceeding six (6) months or both.\n\nAccording to the Chairman, \u201cThe Bill is to provide fire fighting and rescue services or use any equipment maintained by the service for the prevention, extinguishment and control of fire or natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.\n\n\u201cIt is also to ensure that reasonable steps are taken to prevent or mitigate damage to property resulting from fire incidents and promote a culture of safety in the state through pubic education on fire prevention and emergency preparedness.\n\n\u201cProvide for fire safety code to be followed by all persons, including entities operating within the state.\n\n\u201cProvides and maintains fire alarms in such positions in any street or public place as deemed proper, and to affix any such fire alarm to any wall or fence adjoining a street or public place.\n\n\u201cEmploy its services for purposes other than fire-fighting, for which it appears to the service to be suitable, and if deemed fit, to make such charge as may be prescribed for any service, excluding fire-fighting and rescue services rendered in the course of such employment or use.\n\n\u201cIt also provides that the service would prohibit and control the use of materials classified as fine hazard in the erection, alteration, improvement or repair of any building or other structure.\n\n\u201cAll buildings must have fire safety equipment such as conventional fire extinguishers, smoke detector, a central fire alarm system and at least two staircases for storey buildings.\n\n\u201cBuildings that are two storeys or more are to have hose reel equipment and an automatic fire detection and suppression system\u201d, he disclosed.\n\nRaheem explained that the fire service is empowered to investigate and respond to complaints from the public on matters that can lead to an outbreak of fire or other related emergencies.\n\nAdding that, it is also empowered to carry out investigations after fire-fighting and rescue operations and other related emergencies to determine the causes and effects of the incidents.\n\n\u201cThe parastatal will charge fees annually for service rendered other than for extinguishing fires at the rates prescribed under the schedules of the law, and the rate of the fees charged by the service prescribed under the schedules to the law is to be reviewed periodically\u201d, he noted.\n\nHowever, Raheem noted that, the Bill if passed will require every private organisation or company in Lagos state to apply for registration with the service to establish a private fire department or unit.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Director of Lagos State Fire Service, Mrs Abimbola Adeseye said that the public hearing was in line with their duty call in fulfilling the THEMES agenda of the Governor to aid governance and make the state\u2019s security function effectively.\n\n\u201cThat informed some of the provisions in the bill that is being examined.\n\n\u201cIt is to enable us to work more with a law that empowers us to function maximally.\n\n\u201cIt is for us to work at reducing the number of emergencies and the damages it could cause, be it fire outbreak or any other disaster.\n\n\u201cWe want the House of Assembly to help us examine it more and incorporate those things we said could assist our operations and we are urging Governor Sanwo- Olu to sign the Bill into Law in time,\u201d she said.\n\nAdeseye added that the establishment of a fire academy will also help in Lagos State, which she said is available in other climes.\n\nShe stated that it is an institution that is needed in Lagos State to help educate firefighters, not only government workers, but private firefighters.\n\nAccording to her, members of the public are also not left out in the sensitisation, it will let them know what to do in case of emergency.\n\nSome stakeholders expressed their views on the Bill during the hearing.\n\nIn his contribution, a former head of the Lagos State Fire Service, Mr Aderemi Ajose said that the agency should be domiciled under the Ministry of Special Duties and suggested an amendment to some of its sections.\n\nAjose said that two of the board members should be a retired director in the service and that the other should be someone with about 30 years of experience in fire service.\n\nHe also said the Chairman of the Board should be appointed by the Governor with the recommendation of the Head of Service rather than the commissioner of the ministry and that salary and emoluments of paramilitary service agencies should be included in the proposed law.\n\nAlso contributing, Mr Ologunboye Pascal, a retired fire service officer said that provision should be made for fire medics to help in dispending first aid at the fire incident scene.\n\nA fire engineer, who was also at the event, Eng. Jumade Adejola said that commercial buildings, including companies, should be mandated to install fire hydrants in their apartments to reduce fire incidents.\n\nHe added that anyone that is building a market must have a fire hydrant at a close perimeter.\n\nA former commissioner for Home Affairs in the state, Oyinlomo Danmole, who was also present, advised that fire hydrants should be stationed across the state so that firefighters would not wait for water corporations at fire scenes.\n\nEarlier in his address, the Deputy Speaker of the House, Wasiu Eshinlokun-Sanni, who represented the Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa said that the Lagos State Government shall continue to attach importance to the security of the people of the state.\n\nEshinlokun-Sanni recalled that there had been several fire incidents in the state in recent times, adding that the Bill was meant to address issues relating to the issue and find lasting solutions to them.",

From records of history, it is only northern Nigeria that has not called for the breakup of the country at the slightest of pretence.\n\n\u201cWith the arrest of Kanu and now Igboho, we are hoping that the government would go beyond prosecution to digging up and exposing their sponsors and the agenda behind them,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe statement noted that while Kanu\u2019s case may be attributed to some form of insanity which was exploited by the South East elites who were playing a double game, it said Igboho is a deliberate and calculated, supported and encouraged attempt by the Yoruba leaders including their governments to scare the North into agreeing to cede power without competition.\n\nThe group said unfortunately they (Yoruba leaders and government) took it too far by arming Igboho and setting him against law abiding citizens from other regions particularly the North.\n\nAccording to the group, the arrest if considered along with that of Kanu should serve as a lesson to those blind followers who are instigated into setting fire to their own backyards whereas the instigators of such lawlessness and violence almost all the time have a fall-back option that includes escaping abroad.\n\nThe statement observed that the two arrests also attest to the level of cross regional cooperation that is working across Africa.",

          "text": "By Okodili Ndidi, Abuja, Sani Muhammad Sani, Gusau, and Precious Igbonwelundu\n\nBuhari asks Northwest governors to end banditry\n\nCDS meets with ex-military officers\n\nAn Air Force fighter pilot jumped to safety on Sunday after bandits shot down a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha jet in Zamfara State.\n\nZamfara, along with Kaduna, is the hotbed of banditry in the Northwest.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has directed the Northwest governors to end banditry in the zone.\n\nChief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Lucky Irabor has met with retired military officers in the zone to enlist their support for the onslaught against the bandits.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, according to the NAF, was returning from a mission against the bandits when his jet was brought down.\n\nRecalling the incident in a statement, NAF\u2019s Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said: \u201cOn 18 July 2021, at about 12.45 pm, a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircraft, returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna states came under intense enemy fire which led to its crash in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cLuckily, the gallant pilot of the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, successfully ejected from the aircraft.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cUsing his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset. Using the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and maneuvered his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\u201d\n\nThe NAF spokesman explained that the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Alao, on hearing of the crash \u201cdirected that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force said: \u201cdespite the setback of yesterday\u2019s (Sunday) crash, NAF \u201cremains committed to fulfilling Mr. President\u2019s mandate as well as other constitutional roles assigned to it.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s het crash is the fourth this year involving Air Force aircrafts. On May 24, a NAF jet crashed in Kaduna State, killing Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 other officers.",

          "text": "By Damian Duruiheoma, Enugu\n\nApex Igbo sociocultural group Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has told the Federal Government prosecuting the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho would amount to nothing without justice.\n\nIt also expressed surprise at the efficiency with which security operatives arrested Kanu and Igboho without applying similar zeal in treating Boko Haram kingpins, herdsmen and bandits in the North West among other criminal elements.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday in Enugu by its spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia, Ohanaeze said as long as the Federal Government fails to address issues of injustice, many \u201cother Kanus and Igbohos will sooner than later emerge\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ohanaeze, Kanu and Igboho who wittingly or unwittingly are seen as heroes by their people were products of unjust society.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cNigeria security operatives have in recent time shown that they have teeth and can bite.\n\n\u201cThe question on every mouth is whether they can apply similar zeal in treating the Boko Haram Kingpins; Fulani Herdsmen; the North West Bandits, etc. The foregoing selective efficiency of the security operatives elicits the reason for the making of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and Chief Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cOne of the departing admonitions of Pope John Paul II, was \u201cif you want peace, then work for justice\u201d It is an age old maxim founded on reason, experience and truth that the only way for peace to reign in society is for justice to be seen to be served to all.\n\n\u201cWe recall that Chief Sunday Igboho emerged in the scene because he could not endure the daily menace of the herdsmen in the Yoruba localities for a very long time. The herdsmen would kill, maim and rape women at random.\n\n\u201cAll entreaties to the presidency for a swift action against the AK-47 wielding herdsmen appeared to fall on deaf ears. Then Igboho in a patriotic heroic zeal intervened to save the rural farmers, women and children from the daily menace of the herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the military operations against the Boko Haram in the North East of Nigeria but the rate at which the herdsmen destroy farm crops, attack villages, kill the indigenes and forcefully occupy their ancestral lands is most callous, unconscionable and condemnable. This is where the intervention of the presidency is most needed; and of course, the Igboho paradox.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide led by Ambassador Professor George Obiozor has maintained the need for the presidency to embrace equity, justice and fairness in public policy formulations and execution. And that the various forms of agitation in Nigeria is an effect and not a cause in itself.\n\n\u201cThe cause of the agitations is the obvious injustice in federal public policies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMeasures should rather be taken to address the causes of the agitations and only then can Nigeria have peace and sustainable economic growth.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho who wittingly or unwittingly are now seen as heroes by their people, are but the products of unjust society.\n\n\u201cTherefore, a concerted effort in search of the Kanus and the Igbohos without addressing the basis of the agitation is an effort in futility. Otherwise other Kanus and Igbohos will sooner than later emerge\u201d.",

          "text": "*PIB will take care of host oil communities, secure environment, says Buhari\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nAfter over a two-week stalemate, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, yesterday resolved to gradually add more inventory to the oil market, as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) finally put aside their differences.\n\nWith the new agreement, the oil cartel will boost supply by as much as 400,000 barrels per day each month from August until all of its stranded output due to its decision to curb production last year, following the twin impact of the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia and COVID-19 pandemic, has been restored.\n\nThe breakthrough came just as President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nAccording to the new deal, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Russia have now been given new baselines against which their production cuts are measured from May next year.\n\nThe baselines, which were set using October 2018 production volumes, are used by the OPEC+ alliance to set output quotas, so a higher baseline for a country would result in a more generous allocation.\n\nThe UAE had said that the way its quota was calculated was unfair because it didn\u2019t reflect a costly expansion in the country\u2019s industry. Now seemingly convinced by the country\u2019s presentation, the baseline was increased yesterday to 3.5 million barrels per day, below the 3.8 million it initially demanded but well above the previous level of 3.2 million.\n\nOne of the immediate impacts of the new agreement is that it will ease a looming supply shortage and reduce the risk of an inflationary oil-price spike as well as end the division with the OPEC group.\n\nBack home in Nigeria, it is also expected that the truce will lead to some relief for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), whose Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently raised the alarm over the rising oil price.\n\nKyari hard warned that a rising oil price was bad for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria since buyers of the nation\u2019s crude would either resort to buying less or start the search for alternatives.\n\nKyari put the oil price band with which Nigeria would be comfortable at between $50 to $60 per barrel. The price of the commodity hit $77 recently before falling to between $73 and rising again to $75 during the last week.\n\nWith certainty now restored to the market, consumers now have a clear line of sight as to how quickly OPEC+ will restore the 5.8 million barrels a day of production it is still withholding.\n\nA statement after the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), held via videoconference, stated that the ongoing strengthening of market fundamentals, with oil demand showing clear signs of improvement as economic recovery has continued in most parts of the world with the help of accelerating vaccination programmes.\n\nOPEC welcomed the positive performance of participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), especially their overall conformity to the production adjustments which was out 113 per cent in June.\n\nThe statement said OPEC resolved to \u201cAdjust upward their overall production by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis starting August 2021 until phasing out the 5.8 mb/d production adjustment, and in December 2021 assess market developments and participating countries\u2019 performance.\n\n\u201cContinue to adhere to the mechanism to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meetings for the entire duration of the Declaration of Cooperation, to assess market conditions and decide on production level adjustments for the following month, endeavouring to end production adjustments by the end of September 2022, subject to market conditions.\u201d\n\nEffective May 1, 2022, OPEC further agreed to adjust the baseline for the calculations of the production adjustments and reiterated the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of September 2021 and fixed the next meeting for September 1, 2021.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s reference oil production up to the end of April 2022 and effective May 2022 stayed at 1.829 million barrels per day, countries that had theirs raised included Iraq, which was increased from 4.653 million bpd to 4.803 million bpd, while Kuwait\u2019s was raised from 2.809 million bpd to 2.0959 million bpd.\n\nAlso, Saudi Arabia\u2019s baseline was raised from 11 million bpd to 11. 5 million bpd, UAE had theirs raised from 3.168 million bpd to 3.5 million bpd and Russia\u2019s was put at 11.5 million bpd from 11 million bpd.\n\nBut it is unclear how quickly additional supplies can be delivered to the market as August sales volumes are largely locked in and most Gulf countries are preparing for an Islamic holiday that will close government offices and businesses for most or all of next week.\n\nBuhari: PIB Will Take Care of Host Oil Communities, Secure Environment\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in the just-released OPEC bulletin, which was dedicated to Nigeria, the president stated that when it becomes law, the legislation will reinvigorate the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Nigerian oil and gas industry needs reinvigoration in the presence of the global uncertainty and the threats surrounding the industry. This is the purpose of the PIB. We need more investment to be able to derive optimal benefits from these natural resources.\n\n\u201cWe need a better enabling environment for growth in the industry. We need to take better care of the host communities. We need to be more environmentally conscious. And so the PIB is focused on all these, and more.\u201d\n\nHe lauded the oil cartel for the role it has consistently played in the industry, saying that is important because without OPEC the oil industry would have been in a chaotic situation where the winner takes all.\n\nHe added: \u201cMany countries, like Nigeria, would not have been able to develop their oil industry due to stiff competition. However, the good collaboration between OPEC member countries has made it possible to accommodate both the weak and strong players in the oil production industry. This has been very important, and a catalyst, to the development of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the country must constantly look ahead and plan for the future to ensure that it does not get caught off guard, reason it has to keep investing and strengthening its local capability, both in technology and human resources.\n\nHe stated that being a member of OPEC has facilitated closer relationships and fostered bilateral cooperation in other fields and industries as members seek areas where they can be of help to one another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria's national female football team, Super Falcons are on a wasteful trip to Vienna, Austria to train for a self-serving tournament to honour the African country's first lady, Aisha Buhari.\n\nAlready the trip is not short of drama as a visibly angry Nigerian man could be heard in a viral video querying the footballers for representing Nigeria during the government of Muhammadu Buhari, whose regime has been marred by human rights abuses, nepotism, sectarianism, killings, poor economy, and worsened unemployment rate and poverty.\n\nThis happened on a bus after their training in the European country.\n\nIndeed, the contingent of the nine-time African champions - Nigeria - are in Vienna, the Austrian capital, for reasons that are less than noble.\n\nThe team is in Austria for an 8-day training camp as part of preparations for some upcoming games, most notably the Aisha Buhari Invitational Women\u2019s Football Tournament.\n\nA source in the government told SaharaReporters that \"a lot of money is being spent on the tournament organised by the Nigerian Football Association, and this runs into lots of millions.\"\n\n\"It is a wasteful tournament to boost the ego of the first lady who never stands up for the real issues affecting the girl child in Nigeria. So what purpose is this supposed to serve?\" the source asked.\n\nLagos is scheduled to host the six-nation invitational tournament that will see the Super Falcons, Ghana\u2019s Black Queens, Cameroon\u2019s Indomitable Lionesses, Banyana Banyana of South Africa, Morocco, and Mali compete in September for a trophy named in honour of Nigeria\u2019s First Lady, Aisha Buhari.\n\nTwenty-six Nigerian players, alongside technical and administrative staff, are staying at the Event Hotel Pyramide, Vienna for camping.\n\nDirector of organisation of the Aisha Buhari Invitational Women\u2019s Football Tournament, Aisha Falode recently revealed that the committee was determined and prepared to deliver an event befitting the person of Aisha Buhari, which comes at a time when the per capita income of the average Nigerian and other indices of measuring an area's prosperity have nose-dived.\n\nHowever, currently, Buhari Government is characterised by a high unemployment rate of 33.3% (Q4 2020), a high inflation rate of 18.17% (March 2021), and a prime lending rate of 11.24% in April, worse than previous governments. These placed the misery score at 62.2 index point, according to data from Nairametrics.\n\nAfrica\u2019s powerhouses in women's football, namely Cameroon, Ghana, South Africa, Mali, and Morocco have confirmed their participation in the maiden invitational football festival said to be aimed at uplifting the cause of the girl-child in the continent.\n\nBut hundreds of schoolgirls have been kidnapped in Northern Nigeria by bandits and insurgents with the first lady mostly withdrawing into sullen silence.\n\nMeanwhile, according to organisers, the event will address issues affecting women in developing countries with direct reference to the place of the girl-child in society.\n\nThe six-nation football tournament is billed to hold in Lagos from September 14 to 20, 2021, when some kidnapped schoolgirls are still likely to be in the den of bandits and insurgents.\n\nOrganisers of the Aisha Buhari Invitational Women\u2019s Football Tournament have also confirmed that FIFA President, Gianni Infantino; CAF President, Dr. Patrice Motsepe; FIFA General-Secretary, Fatma Samoura, and other world football dignitaries will be in Lagos for the tournament.\n\nBut the same government cannot provide decent schools for schoolchildren.\n\nFor instance, just in June 2021, Nigeria's Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, said the country has the highest number of Out-of-School Children in sub-Sahara Africa.\n\nMr Nwajiuba announced that Nigeria had an estimated 10,193,918 children out of school, many of whom are girls.\n\nHe noted that \u201cthe current challenges affecting the Nigerian education system has left much to be desired, the system is characterised by high illiteracy level, infrastructural decay, and deficits.\u201d\n\nBut according to Falode, \"The football top shots' acceptance to be part of the Aisha Buhari Cup as confirmed by the NFF President is a mark of respect for Nigeria\u2019s indefatigable First Lady, Aisha Buhari.\" \"They want to use the occasion to honour her as well as recognise her various activities and contributions in and outside Nigeria over the girl-child advocacy and empowerment programmes.\n\n\u201cRemember that the football event will host the best women football playing countries in Africa and the presence on such august occasion of the movers and shakers of football in Africa and world will just be right and deserving for the name of the First Lady, Aisha Buhari,\" Falode was also quoted as saying.",

          "text": "Nigeria's national female football team, Super Falcons are on a wasteful trip to Vienna, Austria to train for a self-serving tournament to honour the African country's first lady, Aisha Buhari.\n\nAlready the trip is not short of drama as a visibly angry Nigerian man could be heard in a viral video querying the footballers for representing Nigeria during the government of Muhammadu Buhari, whose regime has been marred by human rights abuses, nepotism, sectarianism, killings, poor economy, and worsened unemployment rate and poverty.\n\nThis happened on a bus after their training in the European country.\n\nIndeed, the contingent of the nine-time African champions - Nigeria - are in Vienna, the Austrian capital, for reasons that are less than noble.\n\nThe team is in Austria for an 8-day training camp as part of preparations for some upcoming games, most notably the Aisha Buhari Invitational Women\u2019s Football Tournament.\n\nA source in the government told SaharaReporters that \"a lot of money is being spent on the tournament organised by the Nigerian Football Association, and this runs into lots of millions.\"\n\n\"It is a wasteful tournament to boost the ego of the first lady who never stands up for the real issues affecting the girl child in Nigeria. So what purpose is this supposed to serve?\" the source asked.\n\nLagos is scheduled to host the six-nation invitational tournament that will see the Super Falcons, Ghana\u2019s Black Queens, Cameroon\u2019s Indomitable Lionesses, Banyana Banyana of South Africa, Morocco, and Mali compete in September for a trophy named in honour of Nigeria\u2019s First Lady, Aisha Buhari.\n\nTwenty-six Nigerian players, alongside technical and administrative staff, are staying at the Event Hotel Pyramide, Vienna for camping.\n\nDirector of organisation of the Aisha Buhari Invitational Women\u2019s Football Tournament, Aisha Falode recently revealed that the committee was determined and prepared to deliver an event befitting the person of Aisha Buhari, which comes at a time when the per capita income of the average Nigerian and other indices of measuring an area's prosperity have nose-dived.\n\nHowever, currently, Buhari Government is characterised by a high unemployment rate of 33.3% (Q4 2020), a high inflation rate of 18.17% (March 2021), and a prime lending rate of 11.24% in April, worse than previous governments. These placed the misery score at 62.2 index point, according to data from Nairametrics.\n\nAfrica\u2019s powerhouses in women's football, namely Cameroon, Ghana, South Africa, Mali, and Morocco have confirmed their participation in the maiden invitational football festival said to be aimed at uplifting the cause of the girl-child in the continent.\n\nBut hundreds of schoolgirls have been kidnapped in Northern Nigeria by bandits and insurgents with the first lady mostly withdrawing into sullen silence.\n\nMeanwhile, according to organisers, the event will address issues affecting women in developing countries with direct reference to the place of the girl-child in society.\n\nThe six-nation football tournament is billed to hold in Lagos from September 14 to 20, 2021, when some kidnapped schoolgirls are still likely to be in the den of bandits and insurgents.\n\nOrganisers of the Aisha Buhari Invitational Women\u2019s Football Tournament have also confirmed that FIFA President, Gianni Infantino; CAF President, Dr. Patrice Motsepe; FIFA General-Secretary, Fatma Samoura, and other world football dignitaries will be in Lagos for the tournament.\n\nBut the same government cannot provide decent schools for schoolchildren.\n\nFor instance, just in June 2021, Nigeria's Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, said the country has the highest number of Out-of-School Children in sub-Sahara Africa.\n\nMr Nwajiuba announced that Nigeria had an estimated 10,193,918 children out of school, many of whom are girls.\n\nHe noted that \u201cthe current challenges affecting the Nigerian education system has left much to be desired, the system is characterised by high illiteracy level, infrastructural decay, and deficits.\u201d\n\nBut according to Falode, \"The football top shots' acceptance to be part of the Aisha Buhari Cup as confirmed by the NFF President is a mark of respect for Nigeria\u2019s indefatigable First Lady, Aisha Buhari.\" \"They want to use the occasion to honour her as well as recognise her various activities and contributions in and outside Nigeria over the girl-child advocacy and empowerment programmes.\n\n\u201cRemember that the football event will host the best women football playing countries in Africa and the presence on such august occasion of the movers and shakers of football in Africa and world will just be right and deserving for the name of the First Lady, Aisha Buhari,\" Falode was also quoted as saying.",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down. The network provider operates in South Africa\u2019s major metropolitan areas with 3,000 towers.\n\nChildren are evacuated from a burning building in downtown Durban, South Africa. Image credit: AP via NZHerald\n\nOnly Cell C\u2019s facilities had not experienced significant damage from the unrest as of Friday, according to its chief operations officer Andre Ittman.\n\nJust one of its network towers was vandalised within the Durban area but it did not affect service delivery to consumers.\n\nAccording to Ittman, there are six other sites available within a two-kilometre radius of the damaged site, which helped to absorb the coverage provided to ensure customers stayed connected.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe ongoing unrest in South Africa, said to be the worst since the end of the apartheid regime 27 years ago, was sparked by the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nLast month, the ex-leader was sentenced to 15 months jail time for defying an order to provide evidence at a judicial inquiry set up to probe high-level corruption during his nine-year tenure (from 2009 \u2013 2018).\n\nProtests swiftly degenerated into violent marches and looting. Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "How Agritech startup, Releaf, wants to change the face of food processing in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dominance of Nigeria\u2019s palm oil industry during the 1960s is often repeated when tales of the country\u2019s glory days are told. In the years following independence, Nigeria was the world\u2019s largest palm oil producer with a whopping 43% market share.\n\nThe story is different today as the country is the fifth-largest palm oil producer, but with only 2% of world production, it is far from a major player in the industry.\n\nAccording to Bernard Okata, a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, the annual demand for oil palm in Nigeria stands at 3 million metric tonnes. However, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, the country only produces 1.02 million metric tonnes.\n\nSuch a considerable gap means that Nigeria has to supplement local demand using imports. And as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, revealed, the country spends about $500 million annually to meet this demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious reports suggest that a lack of funding is responsible for Nigeria\u2019s loss of dominance in the oil palm industry, but that may not be entirely true. In 1965, several countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America received nearly $2 billion from the World Bank for the oil palm industry.\n\nNigeria was the second-highest recipient of this funding with $451.5 million. Furthermore, between 1975 and 2009, it was the second-largest recipient of funding from the World Bank. Therefore, it seems funding was not the major reason for the drop in production.\n\nIt is in this market that agritech startup, Releaf, is looking to make its mark. Founded in 2017 by Ikenna Nzewi (Co-founder and CEO), Isaiah Udotong (Co-founder and Chief Growth Officer), and Uzoma Ayogu (Co-founder and CTO), the startup briefly functioned as a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities.\n\nWhile doing this, the founders realised that food factories could not get enough high-quality raw materials to operate their factories at maximum capacity. They typically have fixed production costs, and the inability to run at optimal levels would mean they pass these costs down to the final consumer.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from leading with solutions, the founders set about understanding the market before making a move. They spent some time interacting with farmers and understanding how the market works. Armed with this knowledge, they changed their focus from a marketplace to an agro-processor producing palm kernel oil (PKO).\n\nPKO \u2014 extracted from the palm seed or kernel \u2014 is often used in food processing industries and cosmetics manufacturing. And according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), it is responsible for about 45% of the fat intake in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, getting quality PKO is difficult, and most factories depend on smallholder farmers responsible for about 80% of the industry\u2019s output. Others rely on importation to meet their needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith little financial assistance, these farmers have to crack the kernels manually, wasting precious person-hours that could be spent producing palm oil.\n\nThis is where Releaf plays. They buy the palm nuts and process them into PKO \u2014 using Kraken, a machine they created \u2014 before selling to factories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nEmployers of labour in Nigeria often complain about the unemployability of Nigerian youth. Still, Nzewi reveals that while it was a bit difficult, they got capable hands who assisted in the development of Kraken.\n\nIt also helped that Ayogu has a mechanical engineering degree from Duke University and previously worked at General Electric.\n\nEmpowering smallholder farmers\n\nSmallholder farmers currently drive the startup\u2019s supply, and Nzewi reveals that they are trying to reorient their mindset from what he calls a margin mentality to a volume mentality.\n\n\u201cA margin mentality is, \u2018okay, I have one ton of these palm kernels, how can I make 10,000 profit off it?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to make as much profit off whatever I have. That\u2019s the mentality I have. A volume mentality is, \u2018how can I work with the partners so I can produce 10 tons of this a week instead of the one tonne I\u2019m currently doing?'\u201d\n\nThis is done through various means, including financing and educating the farmers. With more money and knowledge of agricultural best practices, they can improve their production capacity.\n\nNzewi reveals that there are farmers in their network whose incomes have increased 5x since they started working with them.\n\nIn June 2021, the startup revealed a partnership with OnePipe to enable farmers to access digital financial services. The startup says that over 60% of the beneficiaries are women, with a 100% repayment rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalm kernel mill. Image source: Supplied\n\nThis is significant because women constitute 75% of the workforce in the agricultural sector but do not earn enough and can often lose their land when their husbands or male relatives die.\n\nIt is common for agritech startups that work with smallholder farmers to have an extensive network of farmers, but this is not the route Releaf has chosen. Instead, they are focused on increasing the production capacities of the 3,000 farmers in their network.\n\nAccording to Nzewi, \u201cYou might not see that we have 100,000 farmers that we\u2019re working with in the first year, but you will see that many of our farmers are tripling, quadrupling or 5xing their income, and that\u2019s where our focus is. We\u2019re focusing on rural industrialisation, and we understand that takes concerted effort rather than just giving everyone a t-shirt or giving everyone a form to fill or something.\u201d\n\nDecentralising food production\n\nMost food factories in Nigeria are located in big cities such as Lagos, Kaduna, and Ibadan, but Releaf has taken a different approach.\n\nTheir factory is located in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. As it turns out, the South-South of Nigeria is responsible for 42% of Nigeria\u2019s palm oil production.\n\nOn what the startup\u2019s vision for food processing in Africa is, Nzewi says, \u201cMany people have tried to take Western models and fit them into Nigeria because they see a country with many people. The same thing has been done to the food processing industry, so most food processing factories are set up in big cities like Ibadan, Kaduna, or Lagos.\n\n\u201cThey are big factories with large capacity, but when you go into those factories, you will see that they are using about 30% of the capacity, and that is generally driven by the fact that they cannot get access to high-quality raw material.\u201d\n\nNzewi points out that while food factories in the West often have the luxury of sourcing raw materials from large farms, the same method can\u2019t be applied in Africa. By building factories in these big cities, they have to source their raw materials from distant farmers, which increases their production costs.\n\nConsequently, they can\u2019t pay farmers well. However, by locating factories close to these farmers, Releaf can help them increase their productivity and pay them more than the bigger factories.\n\nPalm trees grow in other parts of Africa, and Nzewi revealed expansion plans in the works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just trying to colour the African map with a presence in different countries, but we\u2019re more focused on deep impact. That\u2019s why I talk about things like the volume mentality and increasing the income of one of our smallholders 5x because that\u2019s the type of impact you should expect to see with Releaf,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalm trees. Image Source: Iwaria\n\nStanding out from the crowd\n\nWhile PKO production is not foreign to Nigeria, Releaf\u2019s technology and scale set it apart. The startup reveals that it can produce 500 tonnes of PKO every week. In addition, Kraken can crack palm kernel nuts with a 95% efficiency, ensuring little wastage.\n\nWith smallholder farmers as their major competitors, its network of 3,000 farmers supplying them with the necessary raw materials gives Releaf a huge advantage.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nHaving created their proprietary technology, I was curious to know if that could change the startup\u2019s focus, but that does not seem to be the case. Releaf plans to build a network of decentralised factories powered by its technology close to farming hotspots on the continent.\n\nHowever, they revealed a willingness to adjust their approach as long as it ties in with their overarching mission to empower farmers and factories.\n\nSixty per cent of the world\u2019s uncultivated land lies in Africa, and experts believe that with the aid of technology and adequate help from research institutions, the continent can feed the world.\n\nWith the help of Kraken, Releaf is gunning for a portion of the global $61 billion palm oil market.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nChaka\u2019s pre-seed round\n\nInternet speed in Nigeria\n\nMobile Money Regulations\n\nChaka secures $1.5 million in pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? On the heels of a shiny, new licence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), digital stock trading platform, Chaka, has announced the raise of $1.5 million pre-seed.\n\nThe round was led by Breyer Capital, a venture capital and private equity investment firm. Other investors include Future Africa, 4DX Ventures, and Seedstars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the funds in place, the startup is looking to expand into other West African countries, strengthen its team by hiring more technical talents, and advance the platform\u2019s functionalities.\n\nAs investments and financial services become digitised, various investment options in stocks and shares are a lot more available and accessible than before.\n\nMany issues beyond technology still shroud Nigerian stock offerings, with more people leaning towards foreign and cryptocurrency investments.\n\nYou can read the details of Chaka\u2019s pre-seed funding here: Nigerian investment-tech startup, Chaka raises $1.5m pre-seed, led by Breyer Capital\n\nInternet speed in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to believe that I am the only Nigerian who has ever argued about what mobile network has higher Internet speed.\n\nThere are also times that I have been shocked by someone praising the Internet speed of a network that I\u2019ve found to be really slow.\n\nWell, on this issue of the condition of mobile and fixed Internet supply in the country, Ookla, via Speedtest\u2122 platform, released a market report on the state of Nigeria\u2019s mobile and fixed networks for Q2 2021.\n\nAs was the case with Ookla\u2019s Q1 report, Airtel remains the fastest mobile operator among the top providers in Nigeria, with MTN being the most consistent. Among the leading providers of fixed broadband in Nigeria, ipNX led the pack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re tempted to question this report, you\u2019re not alone. Let\u2019s not start the argument yet; you can read the report here and examine the methodology.\n\nMetropolises in Nigeria were not left out. And guess what city showed the fastest mobile download speed? Port Harcourt.\n\nThe data pooled showed that the city had the fastest mean mobile download speed \u2014 26.34 Mbps \u2014 among Nigeria\u2019s most populated cities in Q2 2021.\n\nFactors ranging from power disruption at Internet infrastructure sites to the cost of operating a telecommunications licence contribute to the unstable Internet quality in most parts of the nation.\n\nRemember this? Why high-quality Internet in Nigeria remains a dream\n\nEven vandalism of telecom infrastructure is almost normal and this caused the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to declare all telecom infrastructure as Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) in May 2020.\n\nThe following month, the Federal Government approved the deployment of national security to protect telecom infrastructure as is done with oil pipelines and power.\n\nOkay, so what next? A lot that needs to be done to provide sustainable and affordable Internet access in Nigeria and Africa. The actions geared toward achieving this are a combined effort of the governments, telcos, ISPs, and global tech companies.\n\nNigeria\u2019s new regulations for mobile money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been on a regulation spree. From the new licence categorisation for payment services to a new supervisory framework for payment service banks.\n\nQuite recently, it was the turn of Mobile Money Operators. And of course, there were some new ones.\n\nRestrictions, restrictions, and more restrictions: Raise your hand if CBN stopping Mobile Money Operators from lending or giving insurance comes as a shock to you?\n\nWell, if your answer is yes, I\u2019ll point you in one direction very quickly: Why Payment Service Banks could face an uphill battle in the Nigerian market\n\nRobbing Peter to pay Paul: I have another question for you. If MMOs can\u2019t lend you money or help out with insurance, then who can?\n\nDing ding, you guessed it, traditional banks, of course. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Read our conversation with Adedeji Olowe, Trium Network\u2019s CEO, here.\n\nMore to the point, though, how does this new regulation affect Nigeria\u2019s plans to bank the unbanked.\n\nCheck out Ogheneruemu Oneyibo\u2019s article for answers.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe days are long but the decades are short. Read\n\nWhy is Russia So DAMN BIG? Watch.\n\nHave a great day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Intern Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "title": "Why Nigerian SMEs, fintechs should be bothered about the new Mobile Money Regulations",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 9, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) released its Framework and Guidelines on Mobile Money services in Nigeria (PDF). This follows a recent spate of regulations in the payments systems sector targeted at enhancing financial inclusion.\n\nIn 2018, CBN revised the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (PDF) document to reflect its new goal of reducing financial exclusion to 20% by 2020. It also revealed a drastic shift in favour of mobile money and agent banking.\n\nInterestingly, CBN last updated the mobile money regulations in 2015. With the target year of 2020, it is almost safe to expect several changes in these new guidelines.\n\nIn with the new, out with the old. Or not?\n\nOne fact has always been clear, Nigeria does not operate a telco-led mobile money model. Unlike other African countries like Ghana and Kenya, the government employs the bank-led and non-bank-led models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, only banks or licenced corporate organisations can be Mobile Money Operators (MMOs). Previously, only deposit money banks and telcos were excluded from the non- bank-led model. However, this exception now also covers national primary mortgage banks, national microfinance banks, and telecom subsidiaries.\n\nApart from that, these new regulations mean MMOs can now operate savings wallets, issue e-money, recruit and manage agents, card acquiring, and any other activities permitted by the CBN. The circular for New Licence Categorisations for the Nigerian Payments System (PDF) already contained these provisions.\n\nHowever, these regulations formalise and give more insights into the modalities of the wallet system, investment operations, and interest distribution. For example, we now know that all funds in the savings wallet are to be invested in Nigerian Treasury Bills. We also know that fees and charges for managing these investments can not be more than 10%.\n\nUnder these new regulations, MMOs cannot\n\ngrant loans, advances or guarantees (directly or indirectly),\n\nAccept foreign currency deposits,\n\nDeal in the foreign exchange market,\n\nCarry out insurance underwriting,\n\nAccept any closed scheme electronic value (e.g. airtime) as a form of deposit or payment,\n\nEstablish a subsidiary, or\n\nany other activities not permitted by the guidelines.\n\nOther introductions include:\n\nCustomers can no longer escalate complaints to CBN if they are dissatisfied with dispute resolution.\n\nAudited annual returns must now be relayed within the first three months after the year-end or March 31st.\n\nTransaction and balance limits for wallets already stated in a 2017 circular.\n\nPrevious guidelines regarding know-your-customer (KYC), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) codes, usage of Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) for interoperability still apply.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintechs and telcos?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor fintechs in the Mobile Money space, such as Paga and Opay, they can now offer savings wallets that accrue interest.\n\nInterestingly, Paga and Opay already offer these services using their Transactions Savings Wallet and Owealth products, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with restrictions on their ability to accept foreign currency deposits, Paga\u2019s international remittance model could be affected. Under these new regulations, they can only sell foreign currencies from inbound cross-border remittances to authorised forex dealers.\n\nThe other restrictions are the same as those placed on Payment Service Banks (PSBs). And as Techpoint Africa\u2019s conversation with Adedeji Olowe, Trium Networks CEO, revealed, they serve to insulate traditional banks from the competition MMOs and PSBs would otherwise have provided.\n\nPer Inclusion Times, CBN is expected to make MMOs key participants in the upcoming final open banking framework. Open banking will enable banks, particularly microfinance banks, to access their user records for lending purposes.\n\nFor telcos, CBN\u2019s continuous insistence on excluding them from the mobile money space is an interesting move.\n\nIt becomes even more interesting when considered in the light of the role played by telcos as MMOs in other African countries. In Kenya, for example, Safaricom\u2019s M-Pesa helped drive up access to financial services. As of December 2018, there were 25.57 million M-Pesa users.\n\nIn Nigeria, telcos can only acquire a PSB licence and face the same restrictions as MMOs. Currently, 9mobile and Glo are the only telecom companies granted the licence.\n\nIronically, these restrictions appear counterproductive to the CBN\u2019s financial inclusion strategy to bank the unbanked. With a handicap on the services these MMOs and PSBs can provide, the objective of becoming alternatives is only half accomplished.\n\nAt this junction, a statement in Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion strategy document bears consideration. After mentioning Ghana\u2019s mobile money user population increase by 72% within the first year of provider-neutral regulations, the statement reads as follows:\n\n\u201cNigeria can also attain a significant increase in mobile money penetration if it opens the field to more players, particularly non-banks that can offer payment and other financial services while at the same time regulating healthy competition taking into account the Nigerian context and past performance.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Nigerian context? What are the parameters for defining healthy competition vis a vis access to financial services?\n\nIs financial inclusion a myth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBN\u2019s goal of a 20% reduction in financial exclusion by 2020 seems a long way off.\n\nAccording to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa. It also predicts that a 20% rate might not be possible until 2030.\n\nThe survey identifies the main barriers to financial inclusion as institutional exclusion, affordability, access, little/irregular income and low awareness.\n\nEssentially, people complained of banks being too far from their home, how costly it is to go to the bank, bad experiences with traditional banks leading to them closing their accounts, among other things. 51% of the 27,938 persons surveyed either had no job or irregular income.\n\nA 2015 World Bank report on global financial inclusion noted that 59% of the 150,000 respondents cited a lack of money as the main reason for not having a bank account. A second reason was that people depended on family members who already had an account.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate is 33.3% or 23.2 million. The country\u2019s underemployment rate \u2014 people who work less than 20 hours a week \u2014 is also high at 22.8%.\n\nIt is safe to conclude that a low financial inclusion rate is primarily driven by a lack of money. While access to banking services play a crucial role, EFInA\u2019s survey reveals that it only accounts for 31%\n\nThe Nigerian adult population \u2014 18 years and above \u2014 is 106 million. Of this number, about 70 million live in rural areas\n\nPersons in rural areas would rather not go through the hassle of going to a bank several miles away from their homes. With these new regulations, they cannot access loans or international remittances because MMOs and PSBs in their area are restricted from giving loans or accepting foreign currency deposits.\n\nAnother issue raised by the survey is population growth. Although the percentage of financially excluded adults decreased slightly between 2018 and 2020, the actual number increased from 36.6 million to 38.1 million, as population growth outpaces the rate of financial inclusion growth.\n\nWhile the problem of financial inclusion in Nigeria includes access to bank accounts, payments, loans, insurance, remittance, and pension products \u2014 most of which MMOs cannot offer \u2014 it goes beyond that.\n\nAs we have concluded in an earlier article, beyond creating a policy document and a relatively high entry barrier, more deliberate government investments would certainly be needed if the objective of financial inclusion is to be achieved.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "US forces, including the navy\u2019s SEAL Team 6, almost committed an unauthorized incursion into Nigerian territory \u2013 also commonly referred to as an invasion \u2013 last year while undertaking a mission to free a 27-year-old American kidnapped by a local militant group, a new and explosive book from two Washington Post reporters claims.\n\nIn \u201cI Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump\u2019s Catastrophic Final Year\u201d by authors Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, a chaotic scene is described as unfolding when US special forces descended upon the country in an effort to rescue Philip Walton, the son of an American missionary, who had been kidnapped at his home by armed gunmen in neighboring Niger.\n\nAccording to Leonnig and Rucker, US operators had to halt their mission while en route after learning that a White House aide, Kash Patel, had been mistaken in his assertion that Nigeria\u2019s government had given the OK or even been warned about the impending US incursion to rescue the young man, who was being held in a remote compound in the country\u2019s north.\n\nRead Also: President Trump hails US Forces over rescue of American hostage\n\nAccording to UK\u2019s Independent newspaper, the operation resumed after permission was obtained from Nigeria\u2019s government, but the revelation underscored how close the US came to making an unauthorized strike against militants in a foreign country.\n\nPatel, according to the book, was not in a role where it was his job to get in contact with foreign governments to notify them of operations in their territory, but according to the book such processes had broken down in the final months of former President Donald Trump\u2019s term in office.\n\nTrump gave approval for the military action while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was overseas, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien was out of town, and Defence Secretary Mark Esper had yet to discuss the matter with the president, the book claims. In the ensuing confusion, Patel reportedly \u201cassured\u201d senior officials involved in the process that Nigeria\u2019s government had been notified.\n\n\u201cThe mission had to be paused until the Nigerian government signed off. American forces had come very close to a technical invasion of a foreign country,\u201d wrote the authors.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump\u2019s Catastrophic Final Year was released on July 20, published by Bloomsbury.\n\nPatel declined to discuss the events of Halloween when contacted by the book\u2019s authors. The 31 Oct. mission was successful, leading to the deaths of numerous militants, according to the book, while Walton\u2019s rescue was reported by news outlets last year.\n\n\u201cBig win for our very elite U.S. Special Forces today,\u201d Trump tweeted at the time of Walton\u2019s rescue last year.\n\n\u201cLast night, our Country\u2019s brave warriors rescued an American hostage in Nigeria.

Achebe also challenged our (citizens) resignation and inspire us to reject stone age habit which inhibit our dear country from becoming a \u201cmodern and attractive country.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian media space has been awash with Electoral Act amendment which the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had in its report suggested that electronic transmission be employed by INEC where practicable, as contained in section 52(3) of the bill.\n\nHowever, according to reports, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (APC, Niger North) moved that INEC should only consider electronic transmission if the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly. Abdullahi\u2019s motion was seconded by Senator Ali Ndume (APC, Borno South). But some senators notably those of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) disagreed, throwing the Senate into a rowdy session.\n\nIn reaction, the senate minority leader, Enyinnanya Abaribe (PDP, Abia South) then called for public voting. According to Abaribe, the process would allow Nigerians to know who is voting for what. The Senators proceeded to publicly vote but they were visibly divided along party lines.\n\nOur situation as a nation can only get better if we get leadership right. How can we get leadership right if the electoral process that produce our leaders is mired with irregularities as a result of the inefficient manual system? It is a truism that analogue system does not serve any institution well in the 21st century hence INEC in it\u2019s electoral reform bill sought to digitize the electoral process to minimize the jaggedness that comes with the manual system.\n\nWhile many Nigerians saw it as a welcome development and progress long overdue, the National Assembly was plunged into disarray over whether there should be electronic transmission of election results. In the end the National Assembly was polarized along party lines with APC pugnaciously towing the path of reversing to the antiquity of manual election. Their excuse is that there\u2019s limited broadband penetration across the country. But we still have two years to invest in the electronic infrastructures that can give us a free, fair and transparent elections.\n\nRecall also that ballot snatching has been a worrisome phenomenon to electoral process in Nigeria for as long election itself. President Muhammadu Buhari perplexed about the recurrent decimal of ballot snatching during elections, ordered extra judicial killing of ballot box snatchers in the build up to 2019 election. Now that INEC has come up with electronic transmission of results that will eliminate ballot box snatching, APC law makers and the president himself are dilly-dallying about it.\n\nThough one wonders why the president himself has three times declined to assent the electoral reform bill which among others will render ballot box snatchers incapacitated to a very great extent. It\u2019s the President\u2019s procrastination that has lingered the bill at the National Assembly uptill date. The body language of APC leaders across board on the electoral reform bill has raised a lot of conspiracy theories that the party is anxious it will loose 2023 elections should the elections be free, fair and transparent in the manner the bill presents.\n\nBut, regardless of what\u2019s actually happening behind the scenes, one thing is clear. The Independence of INEC is threatened as it is now been subjected to seek approval from National Communication Commission (NCC) or the National Assembly before transmitting election results electronically. This becomes a matter of grave concern as the hope of a credible elections lies in the independence of the unbiased electoral umpire.\n\nThe sixteen years of PDP rule did not fulfil the aspirations and yearnings of the Nigerian masses hence they fell for the change mantra of APC and consequently the party won the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections. But it is rather paradoxical that the party which promised Nigerians change is in practice, curiosily averse to progressive change.\n\nThe six years of APC rule so far has left so much to be desired. Economic hardship and insecurity which the party promised to fix have worsened but the party and president Mohammadu Buhari can be judged kindly by posterity just like Goodluck Jonathan if they give INEC and Nigerians a free, fair and transparent elections by allowing INEC exercise it\u2019s duties without external control, the way it should be.\n\nIn the memorable phrase of President Abraham Lincoln, democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Let the people get the government they want in a free, fair and transparent elections as enshrined in our constitution.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving Corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\n...",

          "title": "Israeli Spy Tech Used Against Daughter of Man Who Inspired \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d",
          "text": "In August 2020, Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan dissident and the inspiration for the award-winning movie Hotel Rwanda, left his home in Texas to fly to Burundi for a speaking tour. When he landed in Dubai to change planes, he sent a WhatsApp message to his family to say happy birthday to his grandson.\n\nThen he disappeared.\n\nFour days later, Rusesabagina emerged on television in Rwanda, handcuffed and escorted by officers. In a bold and complex operation, Rwandan authorities had tricked Rusesabagina onto a private plane in Dubai. It flew him not to Burundi, as he believed, but to Rwanda, where he faced charges of financing terrorist activities.\n\nHis adopted daughter, Carine Kanimba, a U.S. and Belgian citizen, soon launched a campaign to free her father. She never set foot in Rwanda \u2014 but it is likely the government in Kigali had her under close watch, thanks to cutting-edge and highly invasive Israeli spyware that was placed on her phone.\n\nFor almost six months, until as recently as July 3, Kanimba\u2019s cell phone was bombarded with Pegasus, malicious software manufactured by Israeli tech firm NSO Group, according to research by OCCRP and The Pegasus Project, a global consortium of journalists coordinated by Forbidden Stories. Forensic analysis by Amnesty International\u2019s Security Lab, which lent technical assistance to the project, found that Kanimba\u2019s phone was successfully infected with Pegasus multiple times.\n\nWhen Pegasus is implanted on a device, it effectively gives an attacker complete access to the target\u2019s phone. It can read messages and passwords, access social media, use GPS to locate the target, listen to the target\u2019s conversations, and even record them. End-to-end encryption, available through popular apps like Signal, does not protect against Pegasus once the phone is compromised.\n\nIn a series of responses, NSO Group said Pegasus is sold only to governments to go after criminals and terrorists, and has saved many lives. It denied that its spyware was systematically misused and challenged the validity of data obtained by reporters.\n\nAs part of the investigation, reporters obtained a list of over 50,000 numbers throughout the world believed to have been selected by NSO Group clients for targeting with Pegasus. Reporters were able to identify dozens of numbers belonging to Rwandans or other people of likely interest to Rwanda\u2019s government from neighboring countries. They included activists, journalists, dissidents, and government officials.\n\nReporters were unable to conduct forensic analyses to verify infection on these phones, but the extent and nature of the Rwandan numbers in the data strongly suggests that the Rwandan government was a client of NSO Group. There\u2019s also a history of Pegasus being used against Rwandan dissidents. In 2019, a number of Rwandans were among 1,400 victims of Pegasus attack using a vulnerability in the messaging application WhatsApp that became the basis of a lawsuit by Facebook against NSO Group.\n\nThree Western government officials told OCCRP, on the basis of anonymity, that they were aware that Rwanda had access to advanced Israeli spyware technology, and that there was concern at how it was being deployed.\n\nDr. Vincent Biruta, Rwanda\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, said Rwanda does not use or have access to Pegasus. He dismissed the hacking of Kanimba\u2019s phone and the potential targeting of activists, journalists, lawyers, politicians, and others as \u201cfalse accusations.\u201d\n\nKanimba\u2019s number was not on the list of potential targets, but The Pegasus Project decided to approach her separately as a likely victim. A subsequent forensic analysis verified that her phone was infected. Many others on the list were not approached to conduct forensics before publication out of concern that a leak could undermine the security of the journalistic collaboration, or put targets in danger.\n\nRusesabagina has been a high-profile critic of Rwanda\u2019s government for many years. He was the manager of the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines in Kigali during the genocide and helped shelter and save nearly 1,300 people, acts that inspired the 2004 film Hotel Rwanda. Rusesabagina fled Rwanda in 1996, ending up in the U.S. where he was eventually granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.\n\nIn exile, Rusesabagina helped set up a coalition of opposition groups. Rwanda has accused him of a raft of terrorism-related offenses. His daughter, Kanimba, told Pegasus Project reporters that the charges are groundless and that Kagame is jealous of Rusesabagina.\n\n\u201cA running joke in our family is that Kagame thinks about us every night before going to bed,\u201d she said during an interview with Pegasus Project member Knack, a Belgian magazine.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked [about being targeted]. \u2026 Because we are dealing with a dictatorship,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are distracting me by making me think about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also an intimidation tool.\u201d\n\nListening In\n\nBy January 2021, while her phone was being targeted, Kanimba was in Belgium, where Rusesabagina holds citizenship, trying to organize support among European officials for her campaign. Kanimba said she was speaking to officials from several other major diplomatic powers as well.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAll of January and until February 11, I was contacting every single MEP across Europe, also the members of the EU delegation in Rwanda,\u201d she said. She was also using her cell phone in communications with British members of parliament, as well as British and U.S. diplomats and officials. With Pegasus on Kanimba\u2019s phone, it\u2019s feasible that Rwandan agents could have observed and recorded all of these interactions.\n\nHer phone continued to be attacked by Pegasus spyware throughout the first half of this year. It\u2019s not clear why repeated attacks were needed, but researchers believe the software is not persistent and disappears or deletes itself during certain phone operations, such as rebooting.\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s analysis found an attack on June 14, the day Kanimba met with Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sophie Wilm\u00e8s. \u201cI had the phone in the room too,\u201d Kanimba told reporters.\n\nKanimba said Rwandan officials began to act in ways that suggested they were aware of her movements, schedule, and even private conversations. Some Belgian members of parliament who had only expressed support to her privately were subsequently contacted by Rwandan officials, she said.\n\nKanimba told reporters of a conversation between her family and their lawyers about getting Rusesabagina to sign an affidavit describing how he was tortured while held captive.\n\n\u201cWe hadn\u2019t shared [this idea] with the Rwandan lawyers, but the next time our Rwandan lawyer went to see my father in prison he was searched, he was asked for a form that my father was supposed to sign,\u201d Kanimba said. \u201c[The Rwandan lawyer] didn\u2019t know anything about it. We hadn\u2019t even sent it to him. But somehow they knew to look for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenocide Ideology\u201d\n\nRwanda was once the poster child for the success of Western development aid. Emerging from the ravages of the 1994 genocide, in which roughly 800,000 were killed, Kagame\u2019s Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) took power and brought a fragile peace and order to the tiny East African nation.\n\nKagame, an RPF military leader who rose in the ranks to become president in 2000, has ruled Rwanda ruthlessly but effectively. Rwandans enjoy paved roads, fewer blackouts, and a relatively thriving economy compared to other countries in the region. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton led a long procession of world leaders eager to celebrate Kagame\u2019s \u201cvisionary leadership\u201d in the 2000s. But criticism of his methods is growing.\n\nKagame raises the specter of the genocide to justify chasing and crushing his opponents at home and abroad. The RPF dismisses critics as ethnic extremists, while laws against \u201cgenocide ideology\u201d and \u201csectarianism\u201d are loosely defined, allowing the government to criminalize particularly irksome opponents.\n\nIn 2014 the government arrested the popular singer Kizito Mihigo after he released a song remembering Hutu as well as Tutsi victims of the 1994 genocide. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiring against the government. Though freed in 2018, he was captured and rearrested at the Burundian border in February 2020, and found dead in his cell days later. Rwanda claims Mihigo killed himself, but Human Rights Watch and other groups have called for an independent inquiry into his death, which they describe as suspicious.\n\nJournalist and author Michela Wrong, the author of a recent book on Rwanda\u2019s treatment of dissidents, described Rwanda as \u201ca state run along intelligence lines.\u201d Kagame was trained in military intelligence and has carried that through into his presidency, and it\u2019s likely he is personally involved in all major decisions on espionage, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of any real power base outside Kagame,\u201d Wrong told OCCRP. \u201cWhen you have a top-down system of that kind, with such strong executive control, you can take it as read that all of these key decisions \u2013 taking out opponents, harassing and intimidating members of the opposition, surveillance, and monitoring \u2013 all that goes straight to Kagame.\u201d\n\nTargeting Opponents\n\nIn May this year, Cassien Ntamuhanga, a Rwandan asylum seeker and critic of Kagame\u2019s government who had been tried alongside the singer Mihigo in 2015, was arrested by Mozambican authorities. Mozambique police denied knowledge of his detention. Human Rights Watch said that he \u201crisks being handed over to Rwanda.\u201d\n\nNow, reporting by The Pegasus Project has found that Ntamuhanga\u2019s Dutch phone number was on the list of numbers selected by NSO Group clients for targeting with Pegasus.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if any of the Rwandans whose numbers appear on the list were successfully hacked. However, forensic checks of phones around the world from the list showed that, of those that could be tested, 84 percent showed signs of successful or attempted infection.\n\nAnother Kagame critic on the list is David Himbara, who lives in Canada and runs a prominent blog. His number was selected for targeting in early 2019, though forensic analysis of his cell phone did not find traces of an attack. Himbara told the Guardian, a participant in The Pegasus Project, that he believes Kagame poses a threat to his life.\n\nAs well as critics, the Kagame government may have targeted lawyers working against its interests. A South African phone number for lawyer and RNC spokesman Frank Ntwali was added to the list between 2017 and 2019. Ntwali was the target of a failed assassination attempt in 2012, and was one of the Rwandans allegedly hacked by Pegasus via WhatsApp in 2019.\n\nBoth Karegeya\u2019s former lawyer and Rusesabagina\u2019s Rwandan lawyer were selected as targets between 2017 and 2018. Several journalists in Rwanda, Uganda, and DRC were also on the list.\n\nOther than in the case of David Himbara, reporters were unable to carry out forensic analyses on their phones due to security concerns.\n\nDiplomatic Espionage\n\nThe list of selected numbers also shows the Kagame government may have used Pegasus to target high-ranking political and military figures in neighboring countries.\n\nSeveral numbers for high-profile figures in Uganda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) feature in the data. Rwanda has had frosty relations with these neighbors over the years. It has sponsored armed groups in the east of DRC, criticized Uganda for harboring anti-RPF militias, and been accused by Burundi of plotting to overthrow its president.\n\nTelephone numbers for Ruhakana Rugunda, the prime minister of Uganda until last month, and Alain-Guillaume Bunyoni, the prime minister of Burundi, appear on the list. Bunyoni was added before he was appointed prime minister, when he was Burundi\u2019s interior minister.\n\nAmong the Ugandans on the list, OCCRP has identified numbers belonging to longtime senior cabinet member Sam Kutesa, former Defense Forces Chief General David Muhoozi, senior intelligence officer Joseph Ocwet, and leading opposition figure Fred Nyanzi Ssentamu. The selections coincided with a visit by Kagame to Uganda.\n\nIn DRC, OCCRP identified numbers in the data for Lambert Mende and Albert Yuma, both powerful allies of longtime former President Joseph Kabila, who stepped down in January 2019. Reporters also found a number belonging to Jean Bamanisa Sa\u00efdi, a prominent provincial governor in DRC\u2019s gold-rich east. These numbers were selected around the time of a political crisis in DRC over whether Kabila would respect constitutional term limits.\n\n\u201cThere is already enormous, well-founded suspicion between the governments in the Great Lakes region and Rwanda,\u201d said journalist Michela Wrong. \u201c[Evidence of spying] will certainly encourage the view that Rwanda is not a partner playing by the rules.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for the DRC and Burundi declined to comment. A Ugandan government spokesperson, Ofwono Opondo, said that it is \u201cup to Uganda to strengthen its cyber security protocols, otherwise the world is full of spying and espionage even among allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Claws of the Monster\u201d\n\nBack in Brussels, Kanimba says she has purchased a new phone and continued her campaign to free her father. The campaign has enjoyed some recent successes. On June 23, members of the U.S. Congress from both parties sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressing concern over the detention of Rusesabagina. The next day, the Belgian parliament called for Rusesabagina to be freed and allowed to return to Belgium.\n\nEarlier, in February, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the \u201cenforced disappearance, illegal rendition and incommunicado detention\u201d of Rusesabagina.\n\nMeanwhile Rusesabagina\u2019s trial in Kigali has resumed after a hiatus. In March, he refused to participate any further in the trial, writing in a letter to the court that he did not expect justice to be served.\n\n\u201cWe know that emotionally he is a very strong man,\u201d said Kanimba. But she and her family are anxious about the 67-year-old\u2019s health. \u201cHe has hypertension. He has a heart condition. He is a cancer survivor \u2026 This is what scares us the most.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father is in the claws of the monster. So we have to get him out.\u201d",
          "summary": "It flew him not to Burundi, as he believed, but to Rwanda, where he faced charges of financing terrorist activities.\nDr. Vincent Biruta, Rwanda\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, said Rwanda does not use or have access to Pegasus.\nRusesabagina fled Rwanda in 1996, ending up in the U.S. where he was eventually granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.\nHis daughter, Kanimba, told Pegasus Project reporters that the charges are groundless and that Kagame is jealous of Rusesabagina.\nHimbara told the Guardian, a participant in The Pegasus Project, that he believes Kagame poses a threat to his life.",

          "text": "The National Agricultural Land Developement Authority (NALDA), has said that the newly established Integrated Farm Estate in Katsina State, is expected to generate N1.7billion in the first one year.\n\nExecutive secretary/chief executive officer (CEO) of NALDA, Prince Paul Ikonne, disclosed this on Monday during the commissioning of the farm estate in Suduje, Katsina State, by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIkonne expressed optimism that the project, when replicated across the country will increase GDP, reduce\n\nunemployment and will go a long way towards achieving food security.\n\n\u201cThe entire farm has the capacity to generate over N1.7b in the first year,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the estate, established on a 100-hectare land donated by the Katsina State Government, is designed as cyclical, where every process is part of a value chain, adding that the farm has the capacity to engage 1,500 women and youth directly.\n\nIdentifying sustainable development as the only way to promote rational utilisation of resources and environmental protection, Ikonne said the Integrated Farming System (IFS)\n\nholds a special position as nothing is wasted since the by-product of one system becomes the input for another.\n\nHe said the farm is divided into 80 hectares for crop production and 20 hectares for animal production, processing and packaging, with growing of feeds, which include recycling animal wastes as fertilizer for plants, and growing plants to feed the animals.\n\n\u201cWith the farm\u2019s poultry, fishery, rabbitry and bee keeping unit, about 95 per cent of the nutritional requirement of the system is self-sustained through resource recycling.\n\n\u201cAs the number of enterprises increase, the profit margin also increases and further generate employment opportunities to the farming communities all year round and provide better economic and nutritional security,\u201d he explained, adding that the estate is designed with complete production chain for food and livestock, an irrigation system so that farmers will have three production cycles in a year.\n\nThis, Ikonne said will go a long way to\n\nuplifting rural life through increased income following the vision of President Muhammadu Buhari to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty, with focus on the most vulnerable members of the society like widows, poor and unskilled, and teeming youths.\n\nHe noted that the NALDA Integrated Farm is deliberately designed to accommodate, empower and position a new set of 1,500 agro entrepreneurs every year from this category.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis program is under NALDA\u2019s National Young Farmers Scheme (NYFS), which\n\nMr President launched in November 2020. We will take in new farmers every year (and farmers pass out and move on to become independent after being trained and making money). This will attract and keep young people busy in crop and livestock production all year round,\u201d he said.\n\nThe participating farmers are from 13\n\ncommunities, namely Suduje, Madobi, Kaya, Sharawa, Sukwanawa, Dadinkowa, Daberan, Benga, Kurneji, Zari, Mazuji, Tambu and Dannakola, said Ikonne who also said that the farmers were being trained on best agricultural practices in crop farming, livestock, poultry, rabbits and fish farming.\n\nAccording to Ikonne, \u201cThe Integrated Farm Estate comprises 40 poultry pens with a capacity of over 400,000 birds, fish ponds with a capacity of 200,000 fishes, cow and goat pens with a capacity of 500 animals, rabbit pens with a capacity of 3,000 rabbits, bee apiary with a capacity of 540 litres of honey per harvest, crop farming, packaging and processing zones.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe estate has a school, clinic and a residential area, with 120 units of one bedroom apartments so that some farmers and their families can live and work in the farm.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the integrated farm has a processing and packaging zone for fish, chicken and pepper, adding that farmers from outside the estate will also have their products, especially pepper processed and packaged so they can get more value.\n\nSpeaking further, Ikonne noted that for continuity and sustainability, the organisation has designed a management system whereby Jaiz Bank will manage the entire facility with a team of professionals.",

          "text": "Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho was about to board a plane from Cotonou, Benin Republic to Germany when he was arrested by Interpol.\n\nIgboho\u2019s lawyer, Yomi Alliyu (SAN) disclosed this on Tuesday in a statement.\n\nHe said Igboho was about to board a plane to Germany with his wife, Ropo who is a citizen of Germany when he was arrested by the Interpol.\n\nAlliyu said the arrest of Igboho was shocking and appealed to the Benin Republic government and the German government to help curb the excesses of Nigerian government.\n\nHe urged the Benin Republic government to reject any application from Nigeria for Igboho\u2019s extradition.\n\nHe added that Igboho had already filed an application before the International Court of Justice which had been acknowledged.\n\nIgboho had been on the run after the Department of State Services (DSS) invade his house in Ibadan.\n\nThe DSS killed two of his men, arrested some others and declared Igboho wanted.\n\nChief Yomi Alliyu\u2019s statement:\n\nIt is a shocking news that Nigerian Government has gotten Chief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho Oosa arrested by INTERPOL in Republic of Benin notwithstanding the political nature of his offence and what the DSS earlier said that they refrained from arresting him so as not to overheat the polity of Southwestern Nigeria.\n\nIt is advisable for the INTERPOL and Benin Republic to be aware of the savagery acts committed in our clients house in the wee hours of 1st July, 202; between 1.00am and 3.00am; shooting their way through and killing 2 people in the process and maliciously damaging his properties in the course of that illegal invasion.\n\nThough the invading DSS officers did not state any reason for their invasion to our client before or during invasion they later paraded 13 people and ammunitions which our client denied to be his as he is a peaceful campaigner for self-determination and it is on good record that the guns and ammunitions displayed were the same displayed in 2013 in another instance. This could be seen on 2013 Facebook though DSS has dismissed this on their website. But what they cannot deny is that when they were leaving our clients house they left with two corpses and people arrested and nothing more except2 guns belonging to the police escorts of Mr Adisa Saheed Olalekan.\n\nOne of the people they killed was one Mr Saheed Adisa Olalekan of Oladams Motors, Osogbo, who came to Sunday Igboho\u2019s house to discuss auto business. He came with 2 police escorts. Though the policemen were not among the people paraded to the public their guns were among those displayed.\n\nThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo. Nigeria,Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution the host country should not release the fugitive.\n\nNow, Article 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries. This made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a POLITICAL OFFENDER who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason.\n\nSecondly, that he cannot get Justice or even be killed is apparent in how those arrested in his house were detained for more than 21days now without access to their lawyers. Even the wife among them could not change her undies for 21days! Which inhuman treatment can be more this?\n\nAgain another wife of our client Mrs Ropo Adeyemo, a German Citizen, has been arrested together with her husband in Cotonou. What offence has she committed to warrant this?\n\nWe urge the good government of the Republic of Benin and international community, especially Germany, to rise up and curb the impunity of the Nigerian Government by refusing any application for extradition of our Client who already has application before ICC duly acknowledged.\n\nSgd: Chief Yomi Alliyu SAN, FCIArb, mpic",

People who do not have symptoms are not capable of transmitting the virus.\n\nMonkeypox infections of that strain are fatal in about one in 100 people, affecting those with weakened immune systems more strongly.",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",

          "text": "Federal Government has flagged off the construction of the Kaduna-Kano segment of the Lagos-Kano railway modernization project.\n\nSpeaking at the Ground Breaking Ceremony in Kano, President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to reviving the Nigerian Railway system.\n\nHe said the project when completed, will not only drive the nation\u2019s economies through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation but will also reduce the deficiency in our nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis administration recognizes rail transportation as a potent economic driver and as such, has accorded railway infrastructure development the greatest priority it deserves and it is not surprising that several landmarks have been achieved, from the Flag-off for commercial operation of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway in 2016 to the recent commissioning of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project on June 10, 2021, thereby maintaining the pace for the actualization of this vital thoroughfare\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis project is crucial to the establishment of a supply chain in railway transport within its corridor, Kano \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Abuja, as it links the major commercial cities of Kano and Kaduna to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cthis railway connection when completed will establish the ports in Lagos, as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic.\n\nThe railway line will be linked to the second Port in Lagos, the Tin Can Island Port. It is also expected that the Inland Dry Port on these routes will be activated and the ports can now receive imports directly from the international market as ports of destination such as the Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano Inland Dry Ports\u201d.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi says the project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, and further create employment and promote trade.\n\nHe said \u201d The project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, create employment and promote trade. In the long term, the railway will help decongest the Lagos Port Complex and increase its efficiency as well as further increase the viability of the Inland Dry Ports located in Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cThe scope of the railway project involves a 203km double track standard gauge railway from Kano to Kaduna. The railway along this route traverses the major cities of Kaduna, Zaria, and Kano with three (3) railway stations both for passenger and freight services at Rigachukun, Zaria, and Kano with varying capacities and categories\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cThis project will link the Federal Capital, Abuja with the Commercial city of Kano and also link the ongoing Kano \u2013 Maradi project. The outstanding addendum, Ibadan \u2013 Abuja, will link the Sea Ports in Lagos to Maradi, Niger Republic. This I believe will greatly boost trade between the two countries and foster economic development. This railway line will present an opportunity for Nigerians to traverse between Abuja and Kano via Kaduna with relative ease\u201d.\n\n\u201d The rail line is also provided with accessories and special installations including Power and Water Supply schemes, Signalling System & Communication in GSM-R, Freight yards, Rolling stock depots, and maintenance workshops,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna \u2013 Kano railway project is to link the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Railway project via Abuja, Minna, Ilorin, Oshogbo, Ibadan to Lagos on one end, and Maradi, Niger Republic on the other.",

          "text": "Muslims in Nigeria have joined their counterparts across the globe to celebrate the 2021 Eid-El-Adha also known as Eid-El Kabir.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, Muslims converged on the Abuja National Eid Ground to observe the three Rak\u2019at.\n\nThe prayers were observed with strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocols.\n\nBefore going into the Eid ground, worshippers lined up to have their temperatures checked as health workers are also on the ground to administer hand sanitizers on the hands of the worshippers.\n\nAmong the personalities who observed prayer at the National, Eid ground is the FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello.\n\nThe prayer was led by the Imam of the National Mosque, Dr Muhammad Kabir Adam.\n\nIn his Sallah message, the Muslim cleric urged Muslims to imbibe the virtues of self-sacrifice, obedience to God, and love for humanity as exemplified by Prophet Ibrahim. He urged them to share part of the meat of whatever they have slaughtered with those in need.\n\nREAD ALSO: Eid-El-Kabir: Demonstrate Good Virtues Of Islam, Buhari Tells Muslims\n\nThe Minister of FCT, Mr Mohammed Bello whiled addressing journalists at the end of the prayers called on residents of the nation\u2019s capital to be law-abiding, security conscious, and united.\n\n\ufeff\n\nAccording to him, FCT is a melting pot for Nigeria where people of various backgrounds reside, making it the centre of Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\nMr Bello also said the FCT administration will continue to harp on the need for residents to abide by the COVID-19 protocols, especially in the face of a third wave of the pandemic.\n\nBuhari Prays In Daura\n\nIn Daura, Katsina North, and hometown of President Muhammadu Buhari, hundreds of residents from within and outside the town attended the two Rak\u2019at prayers.\n\nPresident Buhari and other dignitaries observed prayers were at the Kofar Arewa Eid Prayer Ground.\n\nThe prayer which was led by Imam Safiyanu Yusuf Dansanwai commenced at about 10:00 am to 10:05 am.\n\nAlso in attendance were the Emir of Daura, Umar Farouq Umar other traditional and religious leaders including the ward, village and district heads as well as members of the business and political communities in Daura.\n\nEid-El-Adha also referred to as the festival of sacrifice, is celebrated worldwide by Muslims and is marked with the slaughtering of rams, cows, and sheep.\n\nIn Muslim parlance, the festival is the most important feast because it is an occasion to celebrate the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son, Isma\u2019el, in submission to Allah\u2019s command.\n\nIn commemoration of this intervention, an animal, usually, a ram, is sacrificed ritually and divided into three parts.\n\nOne share is given to the poor and needy, another is kept for home and the third portion is given to relatives.\n\nAs usual, after performing the two Rak\u2019at Eid-El Kabir prayers and the ritual sacrifice, people come out mostly in Northern states to watch the historic Durbar otherwise called Hawan Sallah.\n\nHowever, due to the pandemic, both Katsina and Daura Emirate Councils have announced the cancellation of the 2021 Eid-El Kabir Durbar Festival to contain the spread of the virus and the banditry.\n\nSanusi Leads Prayers In Kaduna\n\nIn Kaduna, former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi led the Eid prayer at the Murtala Mohammed prayer ground in the Kaduna metropolis.\n\nAmong the dignitaries that attended the prayer include Governor Nasir El-Rufai, the Senator representing Kaduna central, Uba Sani among others.\n\nIn his message, the former Emir of Kano called on Nigerians to continue to live in peace irrespective of their religious or ethnic differences so as to foster peace and unity in the country.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai in his address spoke on the importance of peaceful coexistence. He announced that more troops have been deployed to Kaduna State to help flush out bandits and other criminals in a bid to restore peace and security in the state.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHe, however, solicited for prayers from the citizens to help tackle the myriads of challenges confronting the state.",

          "text": "The chair of former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 inaugural committee was arrested Tuesday on charges alleging he conspired to influence Trump\u2019s foreign policy positions to benefit the United Arab Emirates and commit crimes striking at what prosecutors described as \u201cthe very heart of our democracy.\u201d\n\nTom Barrack, 74, of Santa Monica, California, was among three men charged in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, with conspiring to act as an unregistered foreign agent as they tried to influence foreign policy while Trump was running in 2016 and later while he was president.\n\nBesides conspiracy, Barrack was charged with obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements during a June 2019 interview with federal agents. Also charged in a seven-count indictment were Matthew Grimes, 27, of Aspen, Colorado, and Rashid al Malik, 43, of the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cThe defendants repeatedly capitalized on Barrack\u2019s friendships and access to a candidate who was eventually elected President, high-ranking campaign and government officials, and the American media to advance the policy goals of a foreign government without disclosing their true allegiances,\u201d Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark Lesko said in a release.\n\nProsecutors said Barrack not only agreed to promote UAE foreign policy interests through his unique access and influence, but also provided UAE government officials with sensitive information about developments within the Trump administration \u2014 including how senior U.S. officials felt about the Qatari blockade conducted by the UAE and other Middle Eastern countries.\n\n\u201cWorse, in his communications with Al Malik, the defendant framed his efforts to obtain an official position within the Administration as one that would enable him to further advance the interests of the UAE, rather than the interests of the United States,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a letter seeking his detention.\n\nAuthorities said Barrack served as an informal adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign from April 2016 to November 2016 and chair of the Presidential Inaugural Committee from November 2016 to January 2017. Beginning in January 2017, he informally advised senior U.S. government officials on Middle East foreign policy, they added.\n\nAuthorities cited several specific instances when Barrack or others allegedly sought to influence U.S. policies, noting that, in May 2016, Barrack inserted language praising the UAE into a campaign speech Trump delivered about U.S. energy policy and emailed an advance draft of the speech to be delivered to senior UAE officials.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, throughout 2016 and 2017, the defendants sought and received direction and feedback, including talking points, from senior UAE officials in connection with national press appearances Barrack used to promote the interests of the UAE,\u201d authorities said in a statement.\n\nThey said that after one appearance in which Barrack repeatedly praised the United Arab Emirates, Barrack emailed al Malik, saying: \u201cI nailed it. . . for the home team,\u201d referring to the UAE.\n\nPhone and email messages sent to the UAE Embassy in Washington were not immediately returned.\n\nBarrack will plead not guilty, according to a spokesperson.\n\n\u201cMr. Barrack has made himself voluntarily available to investigators from the outset,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nGrimes also was arrested Tuesday in Southern California. A message seeking comment was sent to his attorney.\n\nBill Coffield, an attorney for al Malik \u2014 who was not in custody Tuesday \u2014 said his client had cooperated extensively with the office of special counsel Robert Mueller and that there was \u201cnothing new here.\u201d He said that al Malik had simply tried to foster a good relationship between the country where he was born \u201cand the country in which he lives and works, both of which he loves.\u201d\n\nBarrack appeared at an initial appearance in federal court in Los Angeles, where prosecutors were to ask a U.S. magistrate judge to bring him to New York.\n\nNoting that Forbes estimated his net worth at $1 billion in March 2013 and his access to a private plane, prosecutors called him \u201can extremely wealthy and powerful individual with substantial ties to Lebanon, the UAE, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u201d who poses a serious flight risk in a letter filed prior to his appearance.\n\nThey said the evidence against him was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and his risk of fleeing was higher because he\u2019d traveled extensively, taking more than 75 international trips in the last five years.\n\nProsecutors also asked that Grimes be held without bail, citing the seriousness of the crimes, overwhelming evidence of guilt, his access to Barrack\u2019s fortune and significant ties to countries without extradition treaties with the United States.\n\nIn his statement, Lesko characterized the alleged conduct as \u201cnothing short of a betrayal of those officials in the United States, including the former President.\u201d\n\nBarrack is the latest in a long line of Trump associates to face criminal charges, including his former campaign chair, his former deputy campaign chair, his former chief strategist, his former national security adviser, his former personal lawyer and his company\u2019s longtime chief financial officer.\n\nAP",

          "text": "Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man, soared about 66.5 miles (107 km) above the Texas desert aboard his company Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard launch vehicle on Tuesday and returned safely to Earth, a historic suborbital flight that helps to inaugurate a new era of private commercial space tourism.\n\n\u201cBest day ever,\u201d Bezos said after the space capsule touched down, kicking up a cloud of dust on the desert floor.\n\nThe 57-year-old American billionaire, wearing a blue flight suit and donning a cowboy hat, was joined by three crewmates for a trip to the edge of space lasting about 10 minutes and 20 seconds.\n\nAfter landing and exiting the space capsule, Bezos and the other crew members exchanged hugs and popped champagne, spraying each other.\n\n\u201cAstronaut Bezos in my seat \u2013 happy, happy, happy,\u201d Bezos said in response to a mission control status check after the crew members buckled back in aboard New Shepard\u2019s capsule following a few minutes of weightlessness in space.\n\nBezos, founder of ecommerce company Amazon.com Inc, and his brother Mark Bezos, a private equity executive, were joined by two others.\n\nPioneering female aviator Wally Funk, 82, and recent high school graduate Oliver Daemen, 18, become the oldest and youngest people to reach space.\n\nThe fully autonomous 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) gleaming white spacecraft, with a blue feather design on its side, ignited its BE-3 engines for a liftoff from Blue Origin\u2019s Launch Site One facility about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural town of Van Horn.\n\nThere were generally clear skies with a few patchy clouds on a cool morning for the launch.\n\nThe flight came nine days after Briton Richard Branson was aboard his competing space tourism company Virgin Galactic\u2019s successful inaugural suborbital flight from New Mexico.\n\nBezos gave a thumbs-up sign from inside the capsule after landing on the desert floor.\n\nHe stepped out to cheers from family members and Blue Origin employees and gave high-fives to some of the roughly two dozen people on hand.\n\nHe founded Blue Origin two decades ago. This was the company\u2019s first crewed flight to space.\n\nNew Shepard was designed to hurtle at speeds upwards of 2,200 miles (3,540 km) per hour to an altitude reaching the so-called K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line \u2013 62 miles (100 km) \u2013 set by an international aeronautics body as defining the boundary between Earth\u2019s atmosphere and space.\n\nAfter the capsule separated from the booster, the crew unbuckled for the few minutes of weightlessness. The capsule then returned to Earth under parachutes, using a retro-thrust system that expelled a \u201cpillow of air\u201d for a soft landing.\n\nThe mission was part of a fiercely competitive battle between Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic to tap a potentially lucrative space tourism market the Swiss bank UBS estimates will be worth $3 billion annually in a decade.\n\nBranson got to space first, but Bezos flew higher \u2013 Virgin Galactic managed an altitude of 53 miles (86 km) \u2013 in what experts called the world\u2019s first unpiloted space flight with an all-civilian crew.\n\nThe flight coincides with the anniversary of Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin \u201cBuzz\u201d Aldrin becoming the first humans to walk on the moon, on July 20, 1969.\n\nNew Shepard is named for Alan Shepard, who in 1961 became the first American in space.\n\nFunk was one of the so-called Mercury 13 group of women who trained to become NASA astronauts in the early 1960s but was passed over because of her gender.\n\nDaemen, Blue Origin\u2019s first paying customer, is set to study physics and innovation management at college in the Netherlands.\n\nHis father, who heads investment management firm Somerset Capital Partners, was on site to watch his son fly to space.\n\nNew Shepard is a rocket-and-capsule combo that cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft.\n\nIt is completely computer-flown and had none of Blue Origin\u2019s staff astronauts or trained personnel onboard.\n\nVirgin Galactic used a space plane with a pair of pilots onboard.\n\nThe reusable Blue Origin booster had previously flown twice to space.\n\nThe launch represented another step in the race to establish a space tourism sector that Swiss investment bank UBS estimates will reach $3 billion annually in a decade.\n\nAnother billionaire tech mogul, Elon Musk, plans to send an all-civilian crew on a several-day orbital mission on his Crew Dragon capsule in September.\n\nOn Twitter, Musk wished the Blue Origin crew \u201cbest of luck\u201d hours before the launch.\n\nBlue Origin aims for the first of two more passenger flights this year to happen in September or October.\n\nBezos has a net worth of $206 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nHe stepped down this month as Amazon CEO but remains its executive chairman.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Research: India\u2019s Deaths During Pandemic 10 Times Official Toll",
          "text": "India\u2019s excess deaths during the pandemic could be a staggering 10 times the official Covid-19 toll, likely making it modern India\u2019s worst human tragedy, according to the most comprehensive research yet on the ravages of the virus in the south Asian country.\n\nMost experts believe India\u2019s official toll of more than 414,000 dead is a vast undercount, but the government has dismissed those concerns as exaggerated and misleading.\n\nThe report released Tuesday estimated excess deaths \u2014 the gap between those recorded and those that would have been expected \u2014 to be between 3 million to 4.7 million between January 2020 and June 2021. It said an accurate figure may \u201cprove elusive\u201d but the true death toll \u201cis likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the official count.\u201d\n\nThe report, published by Arvind Subramanian, the Indian government\u2019s former chief economic adviser, and two other researchers at the Center for Global Development and Harvard University, said the count could have missed deaths occurring in overwhelmed hospitals or while health care was delayed or disrupted, especially during the devastating peak surge earlier this year.\n\n\u201cTrue deaths are likely to be in the several millions not hundreds of thousands, making this arguably India\u2019s worst human tragedy since Partition and independence,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe Partition of the British-ruled Indian subcontinent into independent India and Pakistan in 1947 led to the killing of up to 1 million people as gangs of Hindus and Muslims slaughtered each other.\n\nThe report on India\u2019s virus toll used three calculation methods: data from the civil registration system that records births and deaths across seven states, blood tests showing the prevalence of the virus in India alongside global COVID-19 fatality rates, and an economic survey of nearly 900,000 people done thrice a year.\n\nResearchers cautioned that each method had weaknesses, such as the economic survey omitting the causes of death.\n\nInstead, researchers looked at deaths from all causes and compared that data to mortality in previous years \u2014 a method widely considered an accurate metric.\n\nResearchers also cautioned that virus prevalence and COVID-19 deaths in the seven states they studied may not translate to all of India, since the virus could have spread worse in urban versus rural states and since health care quality varies greatly around India.\n\nAnd while other nations are believed to have undercounted deaths in the pandemic, India is believed to have a greater gap due to it having the world\u2019s second highest population of 1.4 billion and its situation is complicated because not all deaths were recorded even before the pandemic.\n\nDr. Jacob John, who studies viruses at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India, reviewed the report for The Associated Press and said it underscores the devastating impact Covid-19 had on the country\u2019s under-prepared health system.\n\n\u201cThis analysis reiterates the observations of other fearless investigative journalists that have highlighted the massive undercounting of deaths,\u201d Jacob said.\n\nThe report also estimated that nearly 2 million Indians died during the first surge in infections last year and said not \u201cgrasping the scale of the tragedy in real time\u201d may have \u201cbred collective complacency that led to the horrors\u201d of the surge earlier this year.\n\nOver the last few months, some Indian states have increased their COVID-19 death toll after finding thousands of previously unreported cases, raising concerns that many more fatalities were not officially recorded.\n\nSeveral Indian journalists have also published higher numbers from some states using government data. Scientists say this new information is helping them better understand how Covid-19 spread in India.\n\nMurad Banaji, who studies mathematics at Middlesex University and has been looking at India\u2019s COVID-19 mortality figures, said the recent data has confirmed some of the suspicions about undercounting. Banaji said the new data also shows the virus wasn\u2019t restricted to urban centers, as contemporary reports had indicated, but that India\u2019s villages were also badly impacted.\n\n\u201cA question we should ask is if some of those deaths were avoidable,\u201d he said.",
