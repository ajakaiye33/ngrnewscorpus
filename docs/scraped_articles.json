          "text": "The Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, has explained that the Command averted the hijack of a June 12 protest in the Ojota area of the state on Saturday.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that policemen fired tear gas canisters and gunshots at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in the Ojota area, the venue of the June 12 protest on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the CP said his men moved to forestall the hijack.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Police Command, due to its proactiveness, averted the hijack of the rally at Ojota Lagos State when some hoodlums blocked the Maryland/Ikorodu Expressway with the intent to attack motorists that got stuck in the artificial traffic congestion caused by the arranged blockage,\u201d Odumosu said in a statement by the police spokesperson in the state, Muyiwa Adejobi.\n\nThe statement also said Odumosu moved round the state to assess the general security of the state. He reportedly visited Lagos Island, Lekki Toll Gate, Surulere, Alausa and Ojota where he \u201caddressed the protesters on the need to be peaceful and avoid depriving other Nigerians of their human rights to free movement and doing their businesses; noting that blocking the roads will only cause more harms to other innocent Nigerians and threaten the security of Lagos State\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Police boss engaged the protesters in a tete-a-tete for more than one hour at Ojota Lagos State assuring them of the police\u2019s support and responsibility to provide security for them and other Nigerians. He also reaffirmed that the police will never deprive them of their rights to freedom of speech, protest and peaceful rally, but they were however urged to always notify the police of any intending protest or rally in order to plan with them so that such protest would not be hijacked by miscreants.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, therefore, reiterated the command\u2019s commitment to providing adequate security for all and sundry in Lagos State, sustain the core values of policing and tenets of democracy especially respect for fundamental human rights of citizens in Lagos State,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "The Governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, on Saturday, said the only way to resolve the ongoing challenges facing the country is to adopt a true federal system of government.\n\nAkeredolu, however, noted that the challenges were surmountable provided that everyone in the country was sincere in tackling and finding a lasting solution to the problem.\n\nHe stated this at the commemoration of the 28th anniversary of the annulment of the June 12 Presidential Election won by Chief M.K.O. Abiola, held at the International Centre For Culture and Events, on Saturday.\n\nAccording to him the size of the country and its diversity deserved not to have too much power centred at the Federal Government.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is incongruous to have just a police command in a federal state such as Nigeria. The sheer size of the population, coupled with our diversity, makes this arrangement problematic. Every federating unit should have its own police for effective security.\n\n\u201cLocal government administration is the closest to the people and it is, ironically, the most withdrawn from the people it is created to serve. The Federal Government should have no control, whatsoever, over how a local government is run in a state of the federation. Local government cannot be autonomous, absolutely, within a state. Let every state determine the number of local governments it wishes to have for effective administration.\n\n\u201cThe civil service must respond to the current realities for relevance. Let the extent of wealth creation form the basis of establishing local administrations. It does not make any economic sense to create as many local governments as the politics of revenue sharing will permit.\n\n\u201cGovernors must be Chief Executive Officers answerable only to the people indeed. The law must empower them to harness the resources in their respective states for the benefit of those who voted for them. They must not be subjected to any external control as equal partners in a federation unless when it is absolutely necessary.\n\n\u201cThey must be able to mobilise the people for socio-economic activities with minimal interference from the government at the centre. This will enhance their ability to protect their people from rampaging marauders and other criminals who wreck their peace in perpetuity.\u201d\n\nHe regretted that the people looked forward to a better Nigeria where every citizen would be proud, by voting for Abiola in 1993, but the hope was dashed by the military.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying to rekindle the light of realistic expectations since 1999. The political journey proceeds in fits and starts. The ride has been bumpy, creating doubts and suspicion on the genuineness of intentions,\u201d he said.",

Julius Abure made this announcement.\n\n\u201cObiora Agbasimalo is a product of hardwork and commitment. We are desirous to change the narrative in the Nigerian state and in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that the many challenges the state is having is as a result of failed leadership and we want to commence that journey by changing these narratives,\u201d he highlighted.\n\nSome of the narratives he listed include hunger, unemployment, insecurity, and poverty among others. \u201cWe believe that with due diligence, commitment and hard work we will be able to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\nConsequently, Abure said their choice to lead by example by conducting free and fair primaries was displayed for everyone to see. Adding, he said, \u201cThe primary election was democratic; there was consensus building; there was internal party democracy and we all agreed that he is the best candidate for the party.\u201d\n\nAccording to the national chairman, in the next few weeks, they will commence their campaign. \u201cThis time around it is going to be different from the usual way, like a major departure from what we are used to.\n\n\u201cWhile others would be bringing candidates whose names we have been hearing since the 60s and 1970s, you can see that our candidate is a digital candidate, young, vibrant, educated and we believe that the solution of Anambra state lies with him.\u201d\n\nAbure further described Agbasimalo as the people\u2019s choice while assuring the state that he would if elected the governor.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Agbasimalo expressed faith in the party to win the general election, as he thanked all those who supported him, especially \u201cOga ndi Oga solidarity movement, party members and Ndi Anambra\u201d.\n\nHe explained: \u201cMy emergence as the Labour Party\u2019s flag bearer has not come by accident but by attriculated vision and inspired actions towards the building of prosperity, as I will be bringing my over 15 years experience in public and private services.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that I am prepared to give quality leadership to this state. We would be committed to the vision and the collective aspiration of our founding fathers to build more infrastructure, and create wealth and economic prosperity for our people,\u201d he pledged.\n\nSpeaking also was the National Vice Secretary of the party, Clement Ugochukwu, who hinted that the primaries was on the best playground as members trooped in to exercise their franchise.\n\nHe outlined: \u201cThe delegates voted for him and he won. And what stood him out was his confidence. Also we have the structure, \u2018The Oga ndi Oga Solidarity Movement\u2019 and anyone that has its support and backing always wins.\u201d\n\nUgochukwu, however, urged members of the party to throw their weight behind the candidate in the coming general election. \u201cWe are winning,\u201d he declared. \u201cAguata is our own come November 6.\n\n\u201cWe have the person with the structure; we have the party with the name and the labour structure across. LP and all the other organs are all here. Even the police are members of our party. Oga Ndi Oga solidarity movement is here,\u201d he noted.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Nigeria is bed-ridden and dying. Nigeria is not working and has failed\u201d.\n\nThe group said this known during a press conference in Enugu after suspending their nationwide protest scheduled to hold yesterday, lamented the alarming rate of insecurity, banditry, kidnapping and terrorism in the country.\n\nThe association in a press statement read by the National Public Relations Officer, PRO of NANS, Comr, Ezenagu Victor said, \u201cthe fact is that government at various levels has shown little or no capacity in confronting the banes of insecurity and our crumbling economy in the nation.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cToday affords us another opportunity to retrospect on our journey so far as a nation and as Nigerians. We today lividly remember where we started from as a nation, the struggles and sacrifices of our heroes past; where we are today, the unfathomable damage done to the fabrics of our nation by our leaders; and where we are headed, alas for doom if nothing is done urgently!\n\n\u201cObviously, Nigerians and Nigerian students are livid and irate because our joy has been turned to sorrows and our hearts broken by the pain and brutality that our fellow students have suffered in recent times ranging from the abduction of Students of Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, #ABU 7, to the abduction of over 20 students of Greenfield University, down to Niger state and several other states. So many students have also lost their lives as a result of the clashes between the security agents and unknown gunmen which have led to Nigerian students living in perpetual fear.\n\n\u201cPainfully, we live in a nation where students numbering over 200 can be easily kidnapped and taken out of their schools/town without any form of resistance from the security agencies, this calls for serious concern. We have waited so long for the security around schools to be greatly improved to ensure our students are secured but we have seen little or no improvement.\n\n\u201cThese incessant cases of banditry, herdsmen attacks, operations of the unknown gunmen and kidnapping of our students calls for a radical and urgent move by the government to salvagethe situation. We have been daunted by the unending news of killings across the length and breadth of the nation such that death appears normal in our society today.\n\nThese developments are not only unacceptable; they portend great dangers to the very essence of our national unity, progress and development.\n\n\u201cWe cant be hypocritically celebrating democracy when the masses cannot enjoy the dividends of democracy. Just recently the FG through the Ministry of Information suspended the activities of the micro-blogging platform Twitter, what again do we need to confirm that Nigeria is being led by an Authoritarian? There\u2019s in fact nothing worth celebrating about today\u201d, He said.\n\nNigerian Students are thus demand, \u201cThat the government at all levels rise up to the occasion and secure the lives and property of Nigerians which is their first and most important constitutional duty.\n\n\u201cThat the security architecture around our campuses be re-jigged to ensure maximum security for Nigerian Students studying anywhere in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat the FG as a matter of urgency should convoke a national dialogue to discuss the way forward for the nation. That the FG should rescind the suspension of Twitter because it remains one of the most viable platforms where our students connect with their counterparts across the globe\u201d, The demand reads.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

With what has happened, investments are jeopardised and may soon take flight. Our youths are losing the few jobs they have. This should not be the legacy we should leave for our children.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of democracy, I am willing and available for any meaningful dialogue that would bring an end to violence in our dear state.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate here that we need peace for development. We should not be frittering our scarce resources in the management of security crises. You can bear me witness that the achievements we recorded in our first year in office would not have been possible under this kind of hostile and volatile atmosphere. We, therefore, need to move past this and take back our state.\n\n\u201cThe government will continue to meet its obligations to workers.

          "text": "By Simon Utebor, Yenagoa\n\nBayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has said that the state government\u2019s ban on open grazing is backed by law and has come to stay.\n\nDiri, who announced the government\u2019s stance in a state-wide broadcast Saturday to commemorate the 2021 Democracy Day, spoke against the backdrop of reports that President Muhammadu Buhari had restored grazing routes across the country.\n\nHe insisted that the reported pronouncement by the President was not applicable to the state, saying that Bayelsa has no grazing routes because the people are fishermen.\n\nThe state government last week seized 34 cows for breaching the state\u2019s ban on open grazing and pledged to enforce the law to the letter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor also said that it discounted the N38bn refunds for federal projects and received N27bn which had been ploughed back into infrastructure projects across the state.\n\nHe explained that the N38bn due the state was \u2018promissory notes\u2019 and not a cash and was redeemed based on experts\u2019 advice.\n\nThe explanation came amid concerns that the difference between N38 billion and N27 billion amounting to about N11 billion was a shortchange.\n\nPromissory notes and bonds are debt instruments through which one party promises in writing to pay a determinate sum of money to the other either at a fixed or determinable future time under specific terms and redeemable before maturity at a discount.\n\nThe Senate had on November 24, 2020, approved promissory notes and bond issuance worth N148.1bn as refunds to Bayelsa, Rivers, Cross River, Osun and Ondo states for executing federal projects.\n\nA breakdown of the refunds showed that Bayelsa got N38.4bn, Cross River N18.4bn, Ondo N7.8bn, Osun N 4.5bn and Rivers N78.9bn.\n\nDiri further clarified that the state government entered the discount deal with due diligence after consulting economic experts who advised that for the state to get the full value of the debt, it had to wait for the four-year maturity date of the instrument or discount it at market rates.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe governors of the benefiting states met and it was obvious that it made sense to accept the discount option because some second term governors cannot have access to the money when they have left office.\n\n\u201cAlso given the unpredictable inflation and foreign exchange rates, it made sense to go for the discount option, and I want to assure the people of Bayelsa that the decision was taken in the interest of the public.\n\n\u201cWe got that money sometime in December 2020 and deployed it to work on the Yenagoa-Oporoma Road which will connect headquarters of Southern Ijaw Local Government Area by road. Work is advancing at an impressive pace.\n\n\u201cThe Glory Land Drive Road, the AIT-Igbogene, Sagbama-Ekeremor road and so many projects that the previous administration could not complete are receiving attention and the people are free to go and see what we are doing with the refunds.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Thoughts on open grazing\n\nOn the commencement of scheduled commercial flights to the recently licensed Bayelsa Airport, Diri said that plans had been concluded with United Nigeria Airlines to start flight operations to and from Bayelsa from July.\n\nHe said that the state held talks with Ibom Air and the airline requested guarantees that the state government indemnifies it for empty seats until passenger traffic grows, but the aircraft has a capacity for 90.\n\nHe said that as a prudent administration, considering the cost of empty seats in a 90 passenger capacity aircraft, the government got United Nigeria Airline which operates smaller planes with 50-passenger capacity.\n\n\u201cOur earlier plan was to start with Ibom Air and we opened discussions with my brother, Governor of Akwa Ibom during our recent retreat in Uyo and he agreed. We immediately set up a committee to work out the modalities.\n\n\u201cThe committee found that we need to defray the cost of unoccupied seats as a new airport and we found the cost too high for the capacity of aircraft operated by Ibom Air so we had to look for airlines that operate smaller capacity aircraft.\n\n\u201cI can confidently say the scheduled flights will start at our airport in July. Arrangements have been concluded following the presentation of certification documents for daytime flight operations by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.\u201d",

The turnout all over the country was massive even abroad. We thank all the organizers who joined us on this cause.\u201d\n\nAnger over mass kidnappings-for-ransom, a decade-long Islamist insurgency and a crackdown on protesters in Lagos last October has fueled demands for the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to do more to tackle violence and insecurity.\n\nDespite the heavy security presence, Pro-government protesters also gathered at the Unity Fountain in Abuja.\n\nThe protesters who are mostly youths are chanting \u201cSai Baba\u201d to show solidarity and support for President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nReacting to the development, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Police Command said police officers restored calm at Apo-Gudu axis after dispersing a protest by some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) popularly known as Shiites and others targeted at inciting public disturbance and breaching public peace.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mariam Yusuf, the action of the command was necessitated by the concerns of some agitated residents.\n\nHowever, the police said no arrest was made.\n\nThe police stated that it is committed to ensuring that FCT residents enjoy a hitch-free Democracy Day Celebration and will not hesitate to bring to book every person or entity that attempts to breach the peace or cause a breakdown of law and order in FCT.\n\nThe Command implored residents to remain calm and law-abiding while reaffirming its unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT.\n\nTHE Nation had earlier reported that the police on Friday, staged a show of force in Abuja warning protesters to stay in their homes but the protesters had vowed to march on the streets against injustice and poor governance.\n\nThe FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello also assured that Abuja is safe, pleading with Abuja residents to remain calm.",

          "text": "Fellow Nigerians,\n\nI join you all today to commemorate and celebrate our Democracy Day. It is a celebration of freedom and a victory for one people, one country and one Nigeria.\n\n2. As with all democracies we will always be going through improvement processes in our desire to reach the goal of a mature democracy, a strong, evolved and integrated nation state to be reckoned with globally.\n\n3. In the last two years we have witnessed and overcome a good number of testy challenges that would have destroyed other nations especially relating to our collective security.\n\n4. The indefatigable CAN DO Spirit of the Nigerian has sustained us and would keep pushing us to put these challenges behind us.\n\n5. Unfortunately some of these challenges came in the shape of violent outrages leading to the loss of lives of many of our dear compatriots and the destruction of some of our infrastructure, including those devoted to improving our democratic processes.\n\n6. Once again, I want to render my sincere and heart-felt condolences to the families and friends of our gallant service men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty and as a sacrifice to keep Nigeria safe.\n\n7. I extend the same condolence to the families and friends of our country men, women and children who were unfortunate victims of such senseless arsons, kidnappings and murders.\n\n8. I also share the pains of families and direct victims of ransom-seeking, kidnaped victims who went through unimaginable trauma in the course of their forced imprisonment.\n\n9. Let me assure my fellow citizens that every incident, however minor gives me great worry and concern and I immediately order security agencies to swiftly but safely rescue victims and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n10. When you elected me as your President in 2015, you did so knowing that I will put an end to the growing insecurity, especially the insurgency in the North East, but the unintended consequences of our scattering them in the North East pushed them further in-country which is what we are now facing and dealing with.\n\n11. We will, by the Grace of God put an end to these challenges too.\n\n12. Unfortunately, like in most conflict situations, some Nigerian criminals are taking undue advantage of a difficult situation and profiteering therefrom with the misguided belief that adherence to the democratic norms handicaps this Administration from frontally and decisively tackling them.\n\n13. We are already addressing these obstacles and we will soon bring some of these culprits to justice.\n\n14. We are, at the same time addressing the twin underlying drivers of insecurity namely poverty and youth unemployment.\n\n15. Interventions led by Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria driving economic growth over the past 6 years are targeted mostly to the agricultural, services, infrastructure, power and health care sectors of the economy.\n\n16. In the Agricultural sector, for instance, the Anchor Borrowers Programme resulted in sharp decline in the nation\u2019s major food import bill from $2.23billion in 2014 to US$0.59billion by the end of 2018.\n\n17. Rice import bill alone dropped from $1 billion to $18.5 million annually.\n\n18. This initiative supported local production of rice, maize, cotton and cassava. Government financed 2.5 million small-holder farmers cultivating about 3.2 million hectares of farmland all over the country and created 10 million direct and indirect jobs.\n\n19. Several other initiatives, namely AgriBusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme, the Non-oil Export stimulation Facility, the Targeted Credit Facilities operated across the 774 Local Governments.\n\n20. In the manufacturing sector the CBN \u2013 BOI N200 billion facility financed the establishment and operations of 60 new industrial hubs across the country, creating an estimated 890,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\n21. The CBN\u2019s N50 billion Textile Sector intervention Facility increased capacity utilization of ginneries from 30% to nearly 90%.\n\n22. The Economic Sustainability Plan \u2013 our rebound plan for the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020 is currently being executed. The plan is primarily focused on the non-oil sector, which has recorded phenomenal growth contributing over 90% to the GDP growth in Q1 2021.\n\n23. Though marginal we have recorded GDP growth over two quarters; Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. This is evidence of a successful execution of the ESP by the Federal Government.\n\n24. My vision of pulling 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years has been put into action and can be seen in the National Social Investment Programme, a first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part. We now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT.\n\n25. Our conditional cash transfer program has benefited over 1.6 million poor and vulnerable households comprising more than 8 million individuals. This provides a monthly stipend of N10,000 per household.\n\n26. I have also recently approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Plan that augments existing plans to further reduce poverty in Nigeria.\n\n27. As at the end of 2020, the Development Bank of Nigeria had disbursed 324 billion Naira in loans to more than 136,000 MSMEs, through 40 participating Financial Institutions. I am to note that 57% of these beneficiaries are women while 27% are the youth.\n\n28. We are able to do all these and still accelerate our infrastructure development through sensible and transparent borrowing, improved capital inflow, improving and increasing revenue through capturing more tax bases and prudent management of investment proceeds in the Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n29. Our infrastructure revolution continues with key projects attaining critical milestones under the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund; The Second Niger Bridge, The Lagos- Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\n30. I have also approved the establishment of Infraco Plc, a world-class infrastructure development vehicle wholly focused on Nigeria with a capital structure of N15 trillion.\n\n31. The rail system is not left out as the Itakpe-Warri standard gauge rail was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began. The Lagos-Ibadan double track railway line which I have just commissioned has commenced operations.\n\n32. We are focused on ensuring that our infrastructure drive is key to economic growth and one that can be felt by every Nigerian. Building critical infrastructure in our ports is also opening up opportunities for the Nigerian economy.\n\n33. My approval for 4 new seaports using a Public-Private-Partnership approach is hinged on growing the Nigerian economy. These four sea ports; Lekki Deep Sea Port, Bonny Deep Sea Port, Ibom Deep Sea Port and Warri Deep Sea port will create massive job opportunities and foreign investment inflows.\n\n34. We have worked at deepening our Eastern ports leading to success like having three container ships berth at Calabar port, a first in 11 years. Similarly, on October 30 2019, an LPG tanker operated by NLNG berthed in Port Harcourt, the first time an LPG ship is berthing at any of the Eastern Ports.\n\n35. As we invest in these new assets, we have also made strides in ensuring that they are secured and protected. In this regard I am also pleased to note the launch of the NIMASA Deep Blue project \u2013 which is an Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure that I recently commissioned. This initiative is designed to add to the layer of security we have to safeguard our maritime sector.\n\nDear Nigerians,\n\n36. I will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace. Our over-all economic target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is our goal notwithstanding COVID-19.\n\n37. In the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\n\n38. I am very convinced that this 100 million target can be met and this informed the development of a National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy. The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\n\n39. In the last one year, Nigeria and the whole world faced COVID-19 for which no one was fully prepared.\n\n40. Our response to the pandemic involved making hard choices in balancing livelihoods and public health concerns. You are all living witnesses to how successful this has been due to a number of pro-active measures put in place. Our response to COVID-19 is globally acclaimed.\n\n41. We were able to ensure that the various lockdown measures did not impact too negatively on the ability of ordinary Nigerians to continue sustaining their livelihoods.\n\n42. During the pandemic, we disbursed N5,000 to 1 million Nigerians using a Rapid Response Register and advanced N20,000 to 750,000 beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Progamme and provided 1.37 million Nigerians with palliatives from CACOVID.\n\n43. At the same time the Federal Government released 109,000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70,000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation.\n\n44. In addition, Government reduced interest rates from 9% to 5% for struggling businesses and extended credit facilities to 548,345 beneficiaries.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n45. When this administration decided to change our Democracy Day from 29th May to June 12th in my first tenure, it was not only to honour the sacrifices of the men and women of our country who fought for the return to democracy but also to demonstrate our commitment to satisfy the aspirations of the people and creating an environment for democracy to be an accepted way of life.\n\n46. As your President, I remain committed to providing an enabling environment for a free, fair and credible electoral system under my tenure.\n\n47. However, you need to play your part by getting involved at any level you can supporting a democratic system that works for all and not for a section or a select few and demand accountability from your elected leaders.\n\n48. My commitment to bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger.\n\n49. In responding to the challenges that this period imposes on us, Government also recognises the need to acknowledge notions of marginalisation and agitations for constitutional amendments among various segments of our population.\n\n50. While this government is not averse to constitutional reform as part of our nation building process, everyone must understand that the primary responsibility for constitutional amendments lies with the National Assembly.\n\n51. This body which, as I said, is the arm of government responsible for constitutional changes has concluded the preliminary stages of amending and improving our constitution in a way that the majority of Nigerians will be happy with.\n\n52. Government is, however, willing to play a critical role in the constitutional amendment process without usurping the powers of the National Assembly in this regard.\n\n53. As a nation we have come very far from where we started and we are getting incrementally closer to where we ought to be.\n\n54. Overcoming the present challenges is but one of a necessary process that we have to undergo as a nation so that we can come out stronger. The day I joined the Nigerian Army I was prepared to lay down my life for Nigeria.\n\n55. As your President I remain ever committed to upholding and defending Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n56. In adhering to the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy notably section 14(2)(b) I shall do all within my power to ensure that the Security and welfare of the people remain the primary purpose of government.\n\n57. I have, throughout my tenure, provided the security agencies with all they require relative to available resources and will be providing more as the dynamics unfold to put an end to our security problems.\n\n58. My strong belief in the Nigerian spirit gives me comfort that we are facing these challenges with renewed commitment to keep our country one.\n\n59. I thank you for your patience and attention and more importantly your resolve to join hands in making Nigeria the country of our dream.\n\nHappy Democracy Day! God Bless us All, God Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

Commending the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government for its concerted efforts in repositioning the country, Kalu stressed that the President has built critical infrastructure across the nation.\n\nHe cautioned politicians against actions that are capable of polarising the country, noting that Nigeria is better off as a united and indivisible entity.\n\nKalu, who frowned at the recurring destruction of private and public property in some parts of the country, sued for peace and calm across the country, adding that democratic virtues are anchored on rule of law.\n\nThe Senate Chief Whip urged Nigerians to be wary of selfish and power hungry politicians, who are inciting the people against the Federal Government, noting that the President has continued to demonstrate his patriotic determination to build a prosperous nation.\n\nKalu, while acknowledging the achievements of the founding fathers of Nigeria in sustaining a united country, stressed that the country\u2019s nascent democracy is fast growing under the current federal government.

          "text": "\u2022 Atiku, Tinubu, Saraki chart way forward for Nigeria\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Festus Akanbi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a national broadcast this morning to mark Democracy Day, vowed to ensure that the \u201cenemies of state sponsoring crises across the nation\u201d are punished, adding that the trial of those arrested so far would start in earnest.\n\nAlso on the occasion of Democracy Day, prominent Nigerians, including former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar; National Leader, All Peoples Congress (APC) Bola Ahmed Tinubu; former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday called for genuine collaboration among the citizens of Nigeria in the collective struggle to reinforce democratic governance in the country.\n\nThe President in the Democracy Day broadcast reviewed his administration\u2019s six years in office and concluded that much still needed to be done by him for Nigerians \u201cdespite the score of achievements recorded so far.\u201d\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that security challenges facing the nation are being tackled frontally but added that \u201csome criminally minded people\u201d are thwarting his government\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe President said: \u201cWhen you elected me as your President in 2015, you did so knowing that I will put an end to the growing insecurity, especially the insurgency in the North East, but the unintended consequences of our scattering them in the North East pushed them further in-country which is what we are now facing and dealing with. We will, by the Grace of God put an end to these challenges too.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, like in most conflict situations, some Nigerian criminals are taking undue advantage of a difficult situation and profiteering therefrom with the misguided belief that adherence to the democratic norms handicaps this Administration from frontally and decisively tackling them. We are already addressing these obstacles and we will soon bring some of these culprits to justice\u201d.\n\nHe expressed his commitment towards providing an enabling environment for a free, fair and credible electoral system while his tenure lasts.\n\nThe President however advised Nigerians to play their part by getting involved at any level by \u201csupporting a democratic system that works for all and not for a section or a select few and demand accountability from your elected leaders\u201d.\n\nThe President adds: \u201cMy commitment towards bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger.\u201d\n\nHe also said his government was not against the campaign by some people for constitutional amendments to address the issue of marginalisation but stressed that the legislative arm has the constitutional power to address such matters.\n\nThe President said: \u201cIn responding to the challenges that this period imposes on us, government also recognises the need to acknowledge notions of marginalisation and agitations for constitutional amendments among various segments of our population.\n\n\u201cWhile this government is not averse to constitutional reform as part of our nation building process, everyone must understand that the primary responsibility for constitutional amendments lies with the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis body which, as I said, is the arm of government responsible for constitutional changes has concluded the preliminary stages of amending and improving our constitution in a way that the majority of Nigerians will be happy with. Government is however willing to play a critical role in the constitutional amendment process without usurping the powers of the National Assembly in this regard\u201d.\n\nOn his administration\u2019s achievements, the President said they include: \u201cInterventions led by Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria driving economic growth over the past six years, targeted mostly to the agricultural, services, infrastructure, power and health care sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cIn the manufacturing sector the CBN \u2013 BOI N200 billion facility financed the establishment and operations of 60 new industrial hubs across the country, creating an estimated 890,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cThe CBN\u2019s N50 billion Textile Sector intervention Facility increased capacity utilization of ginneries from 30% to nearly 90%.\n\n\u201cThe Economic Sustainability Plan \u2013 our rebound plan for the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020 is currently being executed. The plan is primarily focused on the non-oil sector, which has recorded phenomenal growth contributing over 90% to the GDP growth in Q1 2021. Though marginal we have recorded GDP growth over two quarters; Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. This is evidence of a successful execution of the ESP by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cMy vision of pulling 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years has been put into action and can be seen in the National Social Investment Programme, a first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part. We now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT\u201d.\n\nAtiku, Tinubu, Saraki Chart Way Forward for Nigeria\n\nAlso on the occasion of Democracy Day, prominent Nigerians, yesterday called for genuine collaboration among the citizens of Nigeria in the collective struggle to reinforce democratic governance in the country.\n\nAtiku, in a special message to commemorate the Democracy Day, described the historic June 12 election of 1993 as a dark chapter in Nigeria\u2019s history, insisting that the most important lesson of June 12 is that Nigerians should be united in the defence of democracy and \u201cresist the divide and rule tactics of the enemies of democracy.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Saraki, who described democracy as the best system in evolving a modern government and that it remains the most acceptable globally, however lamented that Nigeria\u2019s democracy has not given birth to good governance.\n\nIn his Democracy Day message, Tinubu called on Nigerians to defend democracy, saying good democratic governance is the only solution to various challenges confronting Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement enjoined Nigerians not to give up in the genuine collective struggle to reinforce democratic governance in the country, despite the intimidation, harassment and rights violations by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its Federal Government.\n\nAtiku: We must not lose Lessons of June\n\nIn a statement he personally signed. Atiku said: \u201cIt is undoubtable that the historic June 12 election of 1993 was a dark chapter in Nigeria\u2019s chequered political history, but we shouldn\u2019t lose the lessons as we build our democracy to greater heights.\n\n\u201cOn the occasion of 2021 Democracy Day, I\u2019m proud to join Nigerians in the celebration of this important day in our recent political history not only because I was part of those challenging moments, but also because of my unshaken belief in democracy.\n\n\u201cAlthough the annulment of MKO Abiola\u2019s election was a major setback, my consolation is that it made Nigerians more united to resist dictatorship and entrench democracy.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president said that the illegal cancellation of the results of the 1993 presidential election was not a personal loss to Abiola, but a loss to Nigeria and its democracy.\n\nAccording to Atiku, \u201cAbiola, whom I stepped down for in the 1993 primary of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Jos, was a good man, and his only primary reason for joining the race was to offer selfless service to the ordinary Nigerians. I was deeply pained by the circumstances in which he was arrested and eventually died in government\u2019s custody. Such gross injustice was unspeakably cruel.\n\n\u201cSadly, the opportunism of some Nigerian politicians had contributed to the destruction of democracy, most of those who aided and abetted General Abacha\u2019s self-succession agenda were politicians.\u201d\n\nTinubu: We must stand up for democracy\n\nTinubu, who is also a former governor of Lagos State, in a statement to commemorate today\u2019s Democracy Day said, \u201cDespite the troubles we face, (and those troubles are serious), we must stand up for democracy lest we shall find ourselves falling to oblivion. Democratic good governance offers the only reasonable solution to the challenges confronting Nigeria.\u201d\n\nGoing further, he said, \u201cWe must stand for democracy today. We must stand for it even more tomorrow. Ask this question 10, 20, 100 years from now, the answer must remain the same: the people of Nigeria stand for democracy and stand against that which would chase democracy from our land.\u201d\n\nCalling for a united front against agents of destabilisation, the APC chieftain said doing so will mean Nigerians are standing against those who traffic in insurrection and violence.\n\nTinubu said: \u201cWe stand against those whose commerce is bigotry and hatred. We contend against those who would render the people ignorant and poor,\u201d\n\nStressing the significance of democracy, Tinubu said: \u201cWe celebrate Democracy Day not only because we have come far but to help give us the social fuel and encouragement to continue onward because we have farther to go and even greater things to achieve as one nation and one people.\n\n\u201cOn this day, let us remember MKO Abiola whose victory in the June 12th 1993 presidential election was stolen from him. Yet he remained steadfast and surrendered his own life so that we all might enjoy the democratic victory that was taken from him. Without his historic effort and sacrifice, this day would not be democracy day. It would be a downcast and disappointing one. Let us also remember all others who also sacrificed so much to bring democracy to this land.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tinubu, \u201cWe best honour these people not by reciting their names but by injecting the spirit and hope of democracy into our words and deeds. In becoming better democrats, we also become better at being Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe explained that one of the most profound and inspiring accounts that shall be written of our nation\u2019s history \u201cwill be the chapter on how we moved from the darkness of authoritarian military suppression into the light of democracy and the establishment of popular government based on the sovereign will of the people.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOn this memorable day, we mark, with respect, and honour the sacrifices that have allowed democracy to come to pass. We also celebrate in anticipation of a future in which our democratic institutions, concepts and practices take firmer root; transforming this society from what it is to what it can be.\n\n\u201cThe pages of our national book inexorably turn. We have seen and experienced much. Victory and setback have entered and exited. The departure of friend and foe we have witnessed. The song of peace and unity we have sung as one national family while others have pounded the drums of war and hate. Laughter and sorrow, we have known.\n\n\u201cThrough it all, our gaze has remained fixed as if it were focused on a star in the firmament. Our road has remained certain for it is the only road we can reasonably tread. We have moved toward a better Nigeria and a greater democracy.\n\n\u201cThis path has not been without peril. There are many who care not for the journey we take. They embark on a different trek for they hold to a different concept of governance and of the relationship of government to the people.\n\n\u201cThey do not believe in a nation where every person therein has substantive rights, freedoms and liberties as God intended for all of his human creations regardless of place of birth, ethnic origin, social station or religious creed. These people hate democracy and despise you for choosing democracy over them and their oppressive ways.\n\n\u201cThey are violent and cold-hearted. They love nothing, save the destruction of the happiness and peace of others. They will not go away quietly or in consideration of the compelling logic of democratic governance.\n\n\u201cInstead, they set us up in hopes of laying waste to the good society we seek to build. They levy terror against us in vain hope that their violent impositions might cause us to lose our way. They raze villages, destroy homes assault and kill innocent people. They even attack important symbols of a just society including religious institutions, schools of learning and INEC offices as if they can snuff out, through violence, mankind\u2019s will to worship God, seek knowledge or engage in participatory governance.\n\n\u201cHowever, with all that they do, they will not succeed. In trying to pluck a democratic and just society from our hands they are as mistaken as they are evil. Our democracy was not here established to be destroyed by the terrible likes of people such as these. Those who sacrificed their lives for democracy did not give of themselves so that we would be turned back by terrorists or by those who seek to tear the nation asunder just so they might imperially rule over some small part of it.\u201d\n\nSaraki: Our democracy has not given birth to good governance\n\nSaraki, who regretted that Nigeria\u2019s democracy had not given birth to good governance, however, stated that it was noteworthy that Nigeria sustained the semblance of a democratic system for 22 unbroken years.\n\nIn a statement he signed, Saraki said. \u201cThere is no doubt that democracy is the best system in evolving a modern government and it remains the most acceptable globally. However, the celebration today should also help us to raise the question of whether democracy is working to serve the interest of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAfter all, it is known widely that democracy is not just the absence of military rule or the routine conduct of elections after which some individuals are announced to have been elected. The real end product of democracy should be good governance.\u201d\n\nThe former senate president said that it was obvious that in Nigeria, democracy had not given birth to good governance.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cWe have inadvertently operated a democracy, which instead of being the government of the people is rather creating a distance between the people and what should be their government.\n\n\u201cElections should be for the purpose of allowing free choice between competing ideologies, manifestos, policies, and programmes.\n\n\u201cElections should not just be about putting people in office and when they get there, they start groping in the dark or thinking about what to do and where to start from. This approach has set us back for many years and deprived our people the opportunity to enjoy good governance or earn what in the national cliche is known as \u2018Dividend of Democracy.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cToday, our country faces security challenges and the government is not able to adequately protect the citizenry. There is massive unemployment which has impoverished a high percentage of the population and many citizens are questioning the basis for the unity of the country. These are pointers to the question of whether democracy is actually working in our clime.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, since Nigerians have accepted that the best form of government is democracy, \u201cwe have no option than to make the system work for our country and her people. Thus, I appeal to all stakeholders to give peace a chance. This is because nothing can be achieved in the absence of peace.\n\nThe quest for peace places a burden on all of us who are leaders, both those in and out of government, to effectively shoulder our responsibilities to our country.\n\n\u201cWe have two years to the formation of a new government. That should mean two years for us to have brilliant ideas on issues of security, education, health, youth employment, revolutionising agriculture, human capital development, improving capacity for delivering good governance to the populace and fostering unity among the people.\n\n\u201cIt should be time for considering how to entrench discipline, equity, justice, respect for the law and accountability as part of our national ethos.\n\n\u201cWe must start to think. We must pre-occupy ourselves with how to make democracy survive and how we can use it to better the lives of our people. I believe this is the best way to ensure we continue to celebrate democracy for many more years.\u201d\n\nPDP: Nigerians Should Remain Law Abiding\n\nThe PDP, in a statement called on Nigerians to remain alert and law-abiding during the planned June 12 Democracy Day anniversary and cautioned the APC to desist from its reported plots to use security forces and thugs to clamp down and unleash violence on citizens as witnessed in the #EndSARS protest.\n\nIn a statement by the party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan also cautioned the APC to forget its alleged plots to use hoodlums to hijack processions and introduce violence, after which it will blame innocent Nigerians as a basis for their planned clampdown.\n\nThe PDP alleged that the Buhari-led APC administration had brutally violated all the known tenets of democracy and returned the nation to the dark era of military dictatorship, all in a bid to hold Nigerians under subjugation.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cThe brazen violation of statutory principle of separation of powers, disregard to rule of law, violent defilement of fundamental rights of citizens, erosion of free speech and freedom of expression, as even being witnessed in the ban on Twitter; stifling of the press, attack on peaceful protesters, manipulation of electoral processes, violation of the independence of the electoral commission, abuse of court processes, disobedience to court orders and other violations, show APC\u2019s aversion to democracy and its tenets.\u201d\n\nThe PDP lamented that June 12, instead of being a day of celebration of democracy, had become a sad reminder of betrayal by the APC and its leaders.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Nigerians,\n\nI join you all today to commemorate and celebrate our Democracy Day. It is a celebration of freedom and a victory for one people, one country and one Nigeria.\n\n2. As with all democracies we will always be going through improvement processes in our desire to reach the goal of a mature democracy, a strong, evolved and integrated nation state to be reckoned with globally.\n\n3. In the last two years we have witnessed and overcome a good number of testy challenges that would have destroyed other nations especially relating to our collective security.\n\n4. The indefatigable CAN DO Spirit of the Nigerian has sustained us and would keep pushing us to put these challenges behind us.\n\n5. Unfortunately some of these challenges came in the shape of violent outrages leading to the loss of lives of many of our dear compatriots and the destruction of some of our infrastructure, including those devoted to improving our democratic processes.\n\n6. Once again, I want to render my sincere and heart-felt condolences to the families and friends of our gallant service men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty and as a sacrifice to keep Nigeria safe.\n\n7. I extend the same condolence to the families and friends of our country men, women and children who were unfortunate victims of such senseless arsons, kidnappings and murders.\n\n8. I also share the pains of families and direct victims of ransom-seeking, kidnaped victims who went through unimaginable trauma in the course of their forced imprisonment.\n\n9. Let me assure my fellow citizens that every incident, however minor gives me great worry and concern and I immediately order security agencies to swiftly but safely rescue victims and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n10. When you elected me as your President in 2015, you did so knowing that I will put an end to the growing insecurity, especially the insurgency in the North East, but the unintended consequences of our scattering them in the North East pushed them further in-country which is what we are now facing and dealing with.\n\n11. We will, by the Grace of God put an end to these challenges too.\n\n12. Unfortunately, like in most conflict situations, some Nigerian criminals are taking undue advantage of a difficult situation and profiteering therefrom with the misguided belief that adherence to the democratic norms handicaps this Administration from frontally and decisively tackling them.\n\n13. We are already addressing these obstacles and we will soon bring some of these culprits to justice.\n\n14. We are, at the same time addressing the twin underlying drivers of insecurity namely poverty and youth unemployment.\n\n15. Interventions led by Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria driving economic growth over the past 6 years are targeted mostly to the agricultural, services, infrastructure, power and health care sectors of the economy.\n\n16. In the Agricultural sector, for instance, the Anchor Borrowers Programme resulted in sharp decline in the nation\u2019s major food import bill from $2.23billion in 2014 to US$0.59billion by the end of 2018.\n\n17. Rice import bill alone dropped from $1 billion to $18.5 million annually.\n\n18. This initiative supported local production of rice, maize, cotton and cassava. Government financed 2.5 million small-holder farmers cultivating about 3.2 million hectares of farmland all over the country and created 10 million direct and indirect jobs.\n\n19. Several other initiatives, namely AgriBusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme, the Non-oil Export stimulation Facility, the Targeted Credit Facilities operated across the 774 Local Governments.\n\n20. In the manufacturing sector the CBN \u2013 BOI N200 billion facility financed the establishment and operations of 60 new industrial hubs across the country, creating an estimated 890,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\n21. The CBN\u2019s N50 billion Textile Sector intervention Facility increased capacity utilization of ginneries from 30% to nearly 90%.\n\n22. The Economic Sustainability Plan \u2013 our rebound plan for the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020 is currently being executed. The plan is primarily focused on the non-oil sector, which has recorded phenomenal growth contributing over 90% to the GDP growth in Q1 2021.\n\n23. Though marginal we have recorded GDP growth over two quarters; Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. This is evidence of a successful execution of the ESP by the Federal Government.\n\n24. My vision of pulling 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years has been put into action and can be seen in the National Social Investment Programme, a first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part. We now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT.\n\n25. Our conditional cash transfer program has benefited over 1.6 million poor and vulnerable households comprising more than 8 million individuals. This provides a monthly stipend of N10,000 per household.\n\n26. I have also recently approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Plan that augments existing plans to further reduce poverty in Nigeria.\n\n27. As at the end of 2020, the Development Bank of Nigeria had disbursed 324 billion Naira in loans to more than 136,000 MSMEs, through 40 participating Financial Institutions. I am to note that 57% of these beneficiaries are women while 27% are the youth.\n\n28. We are able to do all these and still accelerate our infrastructure development through sensible and transparent borrowing, improved capital inflow, improving and increasing revenue through capturing more tax bases and prudent management of investment proceeds in the Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n29. Our infrastructure revolution continues with key projects attaining critical milestones under the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund; The Second Niger Bridge, The Lagos- Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\n30. I have also approved the establishment of Infraco Plc, a world-class infrastructure development vehicle wholly focused on Nigeria with a capital structure of N15 trillion.\n\n31. The rail system is not left out as the Itakpe-Warri standard gauge rail was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began. The Lagos-Ibadan double track railway line which I have just commissioned has commenced operations.\n\n32. We are focused on ensuring that our infrastructure drive is key to economic growth and one that can be felt by every Nigerian. Building critical infrastructure in our ports is also opening up opportunities for the Nigerian economy.\n\n33. My approval for 4 new seaports using a Public-Private-Partnership approach is hinged on growing the Nigerian economy. These four sea ports; Lekki Deep Sea Port, Bonny Deep Sea Port, Ibom Deep Sea Port and Warri Deep Sea port will create massive job opportunities and foreign investment inflows.\n\n34. We have worked at deepening our Eastern ports leading to success like having three container ships berth at Calabar port, a first in 11 years. Similarly, on October 30 2019, an LPG tanker operated by NLNG berthed in Port Harcourt, the first time an LPG ship is berthing at any of the Eastern Ports.\n\n35. As we invest in these new assets, we have also made strides in ensuring that they are secured and protected. In this regard I am also pleased to note the launch of the NIMASA Deep Blue project \u2013 which is an Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure that I recently commissioned. This initiative is designed to add to the layer of security we have to safeguard our maritime sector.\n\nDear Nigerians,\n\n36. I will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace. Our over-all economic target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is our goal notwithstanding COVID-19.\n\n37. In the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\n\n38. I am very convinced that this 100 million target can be met and this informed the development of a National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy. The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\n\n39. In the last one year, Nigeria and the whole world faced COVID-19 for which no one was fully prepared.\n\n40. Our response to the pandemic involved making hard choices in balancing livelihoods and public health concerns. You are all living witnesses to how successful this has been due to a number of pro-active measures put in place. Our response to COVID-19 is globally acclaimed.\n\n41. We were able to ensure that the various lockdown measures did not impact too negatively on the ability of ordinary Nigerians to continue sustaining their livelihoods.\n\n42. During the pandemic, we disbursed N5,000 to 1 million Nigerians using a Rapid Response Register and advanced N20,000 to 750,000 beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Progamme and provided 1.37 million Nigerians with palliatives from CACOVID.\n\n43. At the same time the Federal Government released 109,000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70,000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation.\n\n44. In addition, Government reduced interest rates from 9% to 5% for struggling businesses and extended credit facilities to 548,345 beneficiaries.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n45. When this administration decided to change our Democracy Day from 29th May to June 12th in my first tenure, it was not only to honour the sacrifices of the men and women of our country who fought for the return to democracy but also to demonstrate our commitment to satisfy the aspirations of the people and creating an environment for democracy to be an accepted way of life.\n\n46. As your President, I remain committed to providing an enabling environment for a free, fair and credible electoral system under my tenure.\n\n47. However, you need to play your part by getting involved at any level you can supporting a democratic system that works for all and not for a section or a select few and demand accountability from your elected leaders.\n\n48. My commitment to bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger.\n\n49. In responding to the challenges that this period imposes on us, Government also recognises the need to acknowledge notions of marginalisation and agitations for constitutional amendments among various segments of our population.\n\n50. While this government is not averse to constitutional reform as part of our nation building process, everyone must understand that the primary responsibility for constitutional amendments lies with the National Assembly.\n\n51. This body which, as I said, is the arm of government responsible for constitutional changes has concluded the preliminary stages of amending and improving our constitution in a way that the majority of Nigerians will be happy with.\n\n52. Government is, however, willing to play a critical role in the constitutional amendment process without usurping the powers of the National Assembly in this regard.\n\n53. As a nation we have come very far from where we started and we are getting incrementally closer to where we ought to be.\n\n54. Overcoming the present challenges is but one of a necessary process that we have to undergo as a nation so that we can come out stronger. The day I joined the Nigerian Army I was prepared to lay down my life for Nigeria.\n\n55. As your President I remain ever committed to upholding and defending Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n56. In adhering to the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy notably section 14(2)(b) I shall do all within my power to ensure that the Security and welfare of the people remain the primary purpose of government.\n\n57. I have, throughout my tenure, provided the security agencies with all they require relative to available resources and will be providing more as the dynamics unfold to put an end to our security problems.\n\n58. My strong belief in the Nigerian spirit gives me comfort that we are facing these challenges with renewed commitment to keep our country one.\n\n59. I thank you for your patience and attention and more importantly your resolve to join hands in making Nigeria the country of our dream.\n\nHappy Democracy Day!

          "text": "Saudi Arabia has placed travel restrictions on Nigeria and other countries from performing 2021 Hajj over coronavirus concerns.\n\nThis follows an announcement from Saudi Arabia on Saturday that it will allow 60,000 vaccinated residents of the kingdom to perform the annual hajj.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nAccording to the official Saudi Press Agency, the Hajj ministry said this year\u2019s pilgrimage would be \u201copen for nationals and residents of the kingdom, limited to 60,000 pilgrims\u201d.\n\nWith this, travellers from Nigeria have been barred from performing hajj for the second time in a row.\n\nLast year, the kingdom also hosted downscaled hajj amid the coronavirus pandemic, preventing thousands of Nigerian pilgrims from participating.\n\nThe pilgrimage, scheduled to be held at the end of July, would be limited to those who have been vaccinated and are below 65 years of age with no chronic illnesses, it said.\n\nThe hajj, which is a must for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime, typically packs millions of pilgrims into congested religious sites and could be a major source of contagion.\n\nOnly up to 10,000 Muslims took part last year, a far cry from the 2.5 million who participated in the five-day annual pilgrimage in 2019.\n\nIn a relaxation of coronavirus curbs last October, Saudi Arabia opened the Grand Mosque for prayers for the first time in seven months and partially resumed the all-year-round umrah pilgrimage.\n\nThe limit on umrah pilgrims is 20,000 a day, with a total of 60,000 worshippers allowed to perform daily prayers at the mosque.\n\nThe umrah usually attracts millions of Muslims from across the globe each year. Authorities said the umrah would be allowed to return to full capacity once the threat of the pandemic has abated.\n\nThe revered Black Stone in the Kaaba \u2013 which is customary but not mandatory to touch during the pilgrimage \u2013 remains out of reach.\n\n\u201cIn light of what the whole world is witnessing with the coronavirus pandemic\u2026 and the emergence of new variants, the relevant authorities have continued to monitor the global health situation,\u201d the hajj ministry said Saturday.\n\n\u201cConsidering the large crowds that perform hajj, spending long periods in multiple and specific places\u2026 required the highest levels of health precautions,\u201d it added in the statement carried by SPA.\n\nA scaled-down hajj represents a major loss of revenue for the kingdom, already reeling from the twin shocks of the virus-induced slowdown and a plunge in oil prices.\n\nThe hajj and the year-round umrah pilgrimages together rake in some $12 billion (10.3 billion euros) annually.\n\nLast year, the foreign press were barred from the hajj, usually a huge global media event.\n\nSaudi Arabia has so far recorded more than 460,000 coronavirus infections, including 7,536 deaths.\n\nThe health ministry says it has administered more than 15 million coronavirus vaccine doses in a country with a population of over 34 million.\n\nHosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam\u2019s holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.\n\nBut a series of deadly disasters over the years, including a 2015 stampede that killed up to 2,300 worshippers, has prompted criticism of the kingdom\u2019s management of the pilgrimage.",

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "From ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?",
          "text": "Elections are perhaps the core of democracy, a process where people have a say in who leads and how they are led. It\u2019s the point where citizens exercise their power.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, rather than exercise their power during the democratic process, Nigerians have to exhibit courage and bravery. The annulled presidential election of June 12, 1993, is widely regarded as a constant reminder of how democratic power was, and perhaps still is, stripped from the people.\n\nFor Jerry Ojumah, a blockchain developer and designer, election season in Nigeria is a time of anxiety; the focus is on surviving the process and not on the election outcome.\n\n\u201cHow can performing your civic right be an endangerment to your life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a recurring question as Ojumah narrated how he lost his friend, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, during the 2011 Nigerian presidential election.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2019 general election claimed 626 lives, according to a Premium Times report.\n\nGiven the violence and conflict that characterise Nigerian elections, questioning election results isn\u2019t out of place. Unfortunately, election violence isn\u2019t the only problem plaguing Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to a report by the Law Library of Congress Global Research Center, the 2007 elections observed by the National Democratic Institute reported an obscene amount of irregularities such as underage voting, ballots without names of some candidates, errors in voter registration, and inadequate polling stations.\n\nThe report also highlighted the observations of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), which found out that the election did not meet basic regional and international standards.\n\nIt cited lack of organisation, absence of basic transparency, \u201cwidespread procedural irregularities and significant evidence of fraud.\u201d\n\nTo bring transparency and safety back to elections, perhaps a technological intervention, a process that is immutable and free of external influence, should be considered.\n\nBlockchain technology is often tied to the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin. But in truth, cryptocurrencies are only an application of blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain is to Bitcoin what the Internet is to email. It is just the technology upon which cryptocurrencies work.\n\nAlso known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain has been considered an answer to election problems.\n\nIn a Forbes article, Frank Palermo advocated blockchain voting in the US after an alleged hack of the current voting system in 2016. He says with blockchain, hackers will need to do the impossible \u2014 hack through a network of computers.\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger\n\nBlockchain has been used for elections in some countries, but the technology is very far from mainstream adoption.\n\nPer tech publication Hacker Noon, blockchain was used for voting in Sierra Leone, Japan, and Russia.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the exercise was controversial as it turns out the blockchain company contracted for the job might not have used blockchain at all.\n\nThe tech was also introduced in Tsukuba City, Japan. However, it has only been used to vote for social development proposals.\n\nIt was in the US, however, that the use of blockchain began to look like a real replacement for the current system of elections.\n\nIn May 2018, according to NBC News, West Virginians living abroad were able to send their votes in for a primary election with a blockchain voting system. The news says it was a success as over 140 people voted.\n\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology. This raises the question of how people who are not familiar with the technology will use it during the elections.\n\ni-Elect is a blockchain voting platform with a use case in Nigeria created by blockchain developer and designer Jerry Ojumah. It was made for the Covenant University Alumni Association (CUALA) election.\n\nAccording to Ojumah, the platform will be easier to access than traditional voting methods, with people voting from the comfort of their homes.\n\nVoters can access the platform with a computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. All they have to do is click on their preferred candidate, and the information goes into the blockchain network.\n\nInterestingly, Ojumah adds that blockchain-powered voting will reduce the cost of running elections tremendously. The Guardian reports that \u20a6245 billion was budgeted for elections in 2019.\n\nA large portion of the budget went to logistics and security. Ojumah believes that without the need for logistics and security costs, less than a fraction of that budget would be required to conduct a blockchain-powered election.\n\nNevertheless, usability and scalability remain crucial considerations. Ojumah\u2019s response to this is; a simple user interface, available in most Nigerian languages combined with text to speech features for those who cannot read or are visually impaired.\n\n\u201cThanks to new generation blockchain networks, the platform will be able to process large amounts of data simultaneously,\u201d Ojumah says.\n\nIn cases of poor Internet coverage or lack of smartphones, Ojumah submits that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) can be integrated.\n\nCan it work in Nigeria\u2019s political space?\n\nSegun Amure, a one-time aspirant for councilorship in one of the local governments in Osun State, believes that the government should consider anything that will keep elections free and fair.\n\n\u201cIf blockchain technology can guarantee ease of voting in elections, the safety and will of the people I think is good,\u201d Amure says.\n\nOrowale Triumph, a young politician with dreams of one day becoming president, says, \u201cIt sounds like a process that is not faulted by humans; the creator of the platform or the government cannot influence the data. I think the credibility and transparency of the technology can be vouched for, so why not?\u201d\n\nThough Triumph is sure that blockchain will change Nigeria\u2019s current political climate, he doesn\u2019t think Nigerian politicians will adopt such technology.\n\n\u201cThe entire system needs a change\u2026most politicians will stop at nothing to make sure elections go their way. In such a political situation, they will not succumb to a technology that assures free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nClamouring for electoral reform, Triumph says, \u201cThe power again lies with the masses. If they push for the electoral reform act, then there is a possibility that such a technology will be adopted to foster free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nArguments against blockchain elections\n\nA report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published November 2020, sees blockchain elections as a threat to democracy.\n\nClaiming that online voting would increase cybersecurity concerns, the MIT says \u201cVoatz\u201d \u2014 the platform used for elections in the 2018 West Virginia in the US \u2014 suffers from security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt also says the growing proposals for blockchain elections is borne out of the enthusiasm to improve and modernise elections.\n\nThe report also cites crypto investors\u2019 losses over the years as a reason to distrust blockchain.\n\nAccording to the report, voter verifiability and contestability are some problems blockchain cannot solve. It, therefore, called for a return to the paper balloting system as it is safer than online voting.\n\nConsidering that money can be stolen online and physically, MIT\u2019s report somewhat strangely predicts that the vulnerabilities associated with online shopping and banking will affect voting with blockchain.\n\nCould these positions and submissions result from a misunderstanding of how a blockchain-powered election works?\n\nHow a blockchain powered-election works\n\nAdedayo Adebajo is the Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the African arm of Jelurida, the Swiss company behind the creation of Ardor, a blockchain network with smart contracts capability.\n\nAccording to Adebajo, creating a poll on the Ardor network requires all voters to have a funded Ardor account. This new generation of blockchain gives the option of KYC for users. So, various conditions can be set before a person is allowed to vote. However, voting is not free.\n\n\u201cEvery single vote is a transaction,\u201d he says.\n\nA transaction needs to be made to vote, and a voter needs at least one Ignis \u2014 a child chain of Ardor and a cryptocurrency \u2014 to vote.\n\nAlternatively, the creator of the polls could pay for everyone\u2019s vote. This means that if the federal government creates polls on the Ignis network, they could pay for everyone to vote.\n\nResponding to whether Jelurida will make money if Nigeria holds elections on its platform, Adebajo says, \u201cWe can not really say they make profit from this because it is still made free and the amount paid is merely for usability purposes.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing this piece, one Ignis was approximately 30 cents. Voting for a population of say 150 million people will cost approximately $45 million, which translates to \u20a621.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of the \u20a6245 billion budgeted for the 2019 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the safety of this data, he reveals that in a scenario where 51% of the nodes running Ardor suffer an attack, data could be compromised.\n\nHowever, there are 2,000 Ardor nodes spread across different parts of the world, making the possibility of an attack very slim.\n\nAs a Nigerian, Adebajo feels Nigeria should adopt blockchain voting but he believes it will not happen anytime soon because \u201cthere are a lot of people who benefit from the lack of transparency and lack of digital trails\u201d in elections.\n\nAdebajo suggests that a way to adopt this system of voting is to start small. From voting within associations to voting in local government elections before getting to the national level.\n\nFor Nigerians, adopting a technological solution to solve election problems transcends a desire for ease and convenience during voting. It is perhaps the only alternative to reviving a dying democracy.\n\nNews reports give statistics of lives lost during elections in Nigeria; the pain, however, is inestimable.",
          "summary": "Blockchain technology is often tied to the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin.\nIn a Forbes article, Frank Palermo advocated blockchain voting in the US after an alleged hack of the current voting system in 2016.\nIn May 2018, according to NBC News, West Virginians living abroad were able to send their votes in for a primary election with a blockchain voting system.\ni-Elect is a blockchain voting platform with a use case in Nigeria created by blockchain developer and designer Jerry Ojumah.\nIt also says the growing proposals for blockchain elections is borne out of the enthusiasm to improve and modernise elections.",

          "text": "In Africa, mental health resources are scarce, reflecting the weakness of mental health services on the continent. Also, it mirrors how governments and citizens turn a blind eye to the problem.\n\nPerhaps, that\u2019s why Ted Malanda, a Kenyan humour writer, couldn\u2019t comprehend why American actor Robin Williams \u2014 who suffered from depression \u2014 committed suicide in 2014.\n\nWriting via The Standard, Malanda describes how depression \u2014 a mental health disorder \u2014 is such a non-issue on the continent that African languages do not have a word for it.\n\nImpact of mental health disorders\n\nPhoto by Sam Moqadam on Unsplash\n\nA study shows that 13% of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is primarily due to mental health disorders. Almost three-quarters of this burden lies in low and middle-income countries due to extremely scarce health resources and investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMental health is an integral aspect of wellness because it reflects in daily living, relationships, physical health, work, and school productivity.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that mental health disorders, otherwise known as mental health illnesses, vary and come with different presentations.\n\nThese disorders include depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders.\n\nThey are characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviours, and relationships with others. Therefore, mental wellness should receive as much care as physical health.\n\nGlobally, the impact of mental health illnesses on the economy is significant. The cost of productivity lost annually is approximately $1.15 trillion, while almost 4.7 billion days of productivity are lost.\n\nMayo Clinic \u2014 a US-based non-profit hospital \u2014 mentions that people will always have mental health concerns from time to time. Nonetheless, a mental health concern becomes a mental health disorder when signs and symptoms cause recurring stress and affect the ability to function.\n\nHence, protecting your mental health is essential.\n\nProtecting your mental health with technology\n\nImage by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nThere are effective strategies to prevent and alleviate the suffering caused by mental health disorders, and technology is one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of social media can be a cause of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. However, technology can be advantageous to someone with mental health disorders.\n\nIt has opened a new frontier of mental health support and data collection. Research shows that mobile phones and Internet-connected devices provide an opportunity to collect objective information on individuals\u2019 behaviour.\n\nThis information helps generate a data set that provides insight into an individual\u2019s mental health needs.\n\nThe University of Illinois, Chicago, encourages Internet-based support groups, telehealth, and mobile apps to protect one\u2019s mental health.\n\nMobile mental health support can be simple and effective. Globally, about 800 mobile apps help users cope with symptoms, share their stories, and meet with psychiatrists and psychotherapists.\n\nFurthermore, they provide valuable data to physicians, therapists, and health care informatics experts.\n\nInternet-based support groups help people with mental health disorders, guiding them while they reveal their struggles anonymously. And telehealth provides consultation with a health care provider via phone or video conference.\n\nHow technology is protecting mental health in Africa\n\nA study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) shows that doctors, researchers, and the public can access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental wellbeing with mobile devices like phones and tablets. In Africa, some startups and non-profit organisations already do this.\n\nWe examine two startups and one user-led community helping people with mental health disorders in Africa.\n\nShezlong\n\nFounded in 2015 by Ahmed Abu ElHaz, an Egyptian software engineer, Shezlong is a healthtech startup that offers people in the Middle East and Africa (MENA) region on-demand mental health care.\n\nIt is the first online psychotherapy clinic in the region.\n\nShezlong has a mobile app that aims to help people with mental health disorders become more confident and make better life decisions. They also offer relationship counselling.\n\nShezlong homepage\n\nThe app is used in more than 60 countries. Over 300 certified and trusted therapists and psychiatrists are conveniently, privately, and anonymously connected with people with mental disorders in MENA.\n\nTruthshare\n\nTruthshare is an online mental health application that helps people get counselling. It was co-founded in 2019 by two Nigerians: Kuro Briggs and Fortune Bekee.\n\nTruthshare homepage\n\nThe online app aims to improve the mental health of Nigerians. It leverages the Internet to provide a safe place where people can express themselves anonymously, get access to certified counsellors, and feel better.\n\nMoreover, the public can offer advice to people struggling with their mental health.\n\nMentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI)\n\nMANI is a user-led community that uses social media platforms to reach its audience.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Victor Ugo, MANI is based on two core beliefs: to alleviate the stigma and suffering which arises from mental disorders and to know that people who have mental health disorders have a right to life and assistance.\n\nMANI attempts to fight stigma, improve mental health literacy, and drive policies that benefit mental health service users and those at risk.\n\nIt also engages in activities and services that promote and prevent mental health issues.\n\nWhen asked how MANI has helped people with mental health disorders, Max, a writer, told Techpoint Africa, \u201cWhen I was depressed last year, Mentally Aware Nigeria helped me get better. They assigned someone \u2014 who should be a counsellor \u2014 to me. They followed me up on WhatsApp until I started feeling better. That worked for me.\u201d\n\nTechnology has made mental health care affordable and convenient. And anyone with a mental illness can get care anywhere. The use of mobile apps and online platforms offer users the option of anonymity, helping them avoid stigmatisation as they share their stories.\n\nIn recognition of Global Wellness Day, we want you to take care of your mental health as much as you do your physical health. If social media is a source of depression or anxiety for you, you could take a break and take advantage of the Internet.\n\nWe care about your mental health and hope you get the help you need.\n\nHappy Global Wellness Day.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations\n\nApple Health features for the elderly\n\nPlentywaka partners with GUO\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nThe global fintech industry recorded impressive growth in 2020. This is according to the State of Finance App Marketing 2021 report by US-based mobile marketing analytics company, AppsFlyer. The report reveals that beyond funding, fintech app installations grew by160% in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria alone, loan app installations grew by 43.3%; financial services grew by 34.6%, and investment apps by 20.3%.\n\nSimilarly, Kenya saw 100% growth, and South Africa 52% growth, in fintech app installations.\n\nWhy this growth? The economic effects of COVID-19 led to the rise in fintech app installations.\n\nBesides, in Nigeria, about 56% of the population is unbanked. Also, the unfavourable regulatory conditions could have prompted some of them to make use of loan apps while they explored other financial services.\n\nInterestingly, the fintech space recorded a significant boom in marketing investment. Over 150 Nigerian fintech startups reportedly generate annual revenues of over $5 million.\n\nTo read more on the state of fintech apps, click here.\n\nApple introduces new iPhone features for the elderly\n\nApple, at its World wide developer conference (WWDC) event, announced new features for iOS 15 on the iPhone. The event which started on Monday, June 7 will end today, Friday, June 11.\n\nThoughtfully, among the new features, Apple introduced two health-focused ones \u2014 Walking Steadiness and ability to share health data with family members \u2014 for the elderly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy these features? Older people are prone to falling, and it is the major cause of accidents, injury, and death for older people.\n\nHow does it work? The feature intends to track people as they move through their daily lives.\n\nNot to be confused with fall detection on the Apple Watch, which prompts users to call emergency services, Apple says Walking Steadiness is different, as it focuses on prediction rather than response.\n\nThat is, it is able to predict your risk of falling, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\nWhile this may seem exciting, I doubt its ability to help everyone, as walking patterns differ. Moreover, it is only effective if users carry their phones around at all times; some don\u2019t.\n\nStill, it\u2019s good to know Apple does not just target only the young, but the elderly too.\n\nWalking Steadiness will be available for everyone who has an iPhone 6s and above.\n\nPlentywaka partners GUO to expand inter-state\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nPlentywaka, a Nigerian bus-hailing tech company, has announced its partnership with interstate bus company, GUO Transport, to expand its reach.\n\nThis will lead to the opening of new routes on Plentywaka\u2019s inter-state offshoot, Travelwaka. About 200 routes are expected to be launched. Plentywaka will onboard 600 new buses from GUO, bringing total buses on the platform to 850.\n\nThis partnership is mutually beneficial because GUO doesn\u2019t have to build and maintain proprietary tech for commuters to find them online. Plentywaka, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to buy buses to expand inter-state.\n\nThe end goal of PlentyWaka is to give its users an easy way to compare their choices from a range of travel companies. So perhaps we can expect it to onboard more inter-state bus companies in the near future.\n\nSounds familiar? You might remember Oya.com.ng, the bus ticketing website that was acquired by Wakanow in 2015, barely 2 years into operation. They employed a similar inventory-less model.\n\nSidebar: It might interest you to know that GIGM, another major bus company, has a tech-enabled platform that allows investors to place their buses on its inter-state network.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching this weekend\n\nImproving early child development with words. Watch.\n\nHow China lost patience with its loudest billionaire. Watch.\n\nHave an amazing weekend ahead.\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.",

Dep Gov\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu on Saturday in Benin, called on Nigerians to work together in sustenance of democratic ideals so as to provide room for equity, freedom of speech and sustainable development.\n\nShaibu stated this while addressing a cross section of protesters who were in a peaceful protest to Edo Government House, Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have distinguished between the military and civil rule. We have agreed that the difference is freedom of speech. Democracy is here to stay. We have fought for the sustenance of democracy.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of the 14 lawmakers-elect who abdicated their roles, he said, \u201cI also want to address the issue of the 14 Edo State House of Assembly members-elect who failed to make themselves available for swearing-in after Governor Godwin Obaseki issued a proclamation letter.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, I don\u2019t have a representative from Etsako West Constituency II because these characters decided to follow a godfather shortly after they were voted into office. Today, godfathers have taken over our democracy.\n\n\u201cThey have taken over democracy that you and I struggled for. The democracy that the likes of Ransome Kuti and Gani Fawehinmi fought for. All of them struggled to have democracy.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the development has destroyed the fabric of our society, adding, \u201cIn Edo, these characters decided to follow a godfather. One of our Comrades, Adams Oshiomhole, led us in the struggle in Edo to say no to godfatherism.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately, he removed his khaki and now wears the armor of a godfather. This led to the kind of House of Assembly we now have in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe did everything to beg them; we said you are not representing one godfather you are representing the good people of your constituency. But they refused to come back and be sworn-in. Somebody far away in Lagos, instead was giving them instructions. He said that the governor should issue a second proclamation letter which is against the law. How can somebody from Lagos be dictating for us in Edo? We said no to that, and insisted that Edo people must decide for themselves.\n\nShaibu said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been unable to conduct a bye-election, because the matter was still in the court.\n\nThe deputy governor also advocated for a unicameral legislature to reduce the cost of governance, adding that the funds saved from the restructured legislative system would be used for the development of states.\n\nHe further advocated for state policing, noting that the policing arrangement should be given consideration in the ongoing constitution amendment process so as to check insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nOne of the protesters, Abraham Oviawe, said the quest was for all Nigerians to enjoy the dividends of democracy, noting that the present administration has stifled free speech.\n\nHe urged the government to ensure adequate security of lives and property, saying that the Federal Government is paying lip service to the issue of security.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of democracy, Nigerians are still suffering as the standard of living has gone from bad to worse in the country. We enjoy freedom of speech but not freedom after speech. Democracy is a reminder to the people the quality of service before them,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

Others were seen in front of Mapo Hall and Challenge areas in Ibadan Metropolis.\n\nThe appearance of Governor Seyi Makinde at Agodi and Yemetu area of Ibadan Ibadan where he addressed the protesters added to the glamour.\n\nMakinde promised the protesters that his government would address the problem of insecurity which has been major concern of all Nigerians and the residents of Oyo state in particular.\n\nHe lamented the recent killing of people in parts of the state by suspected herders, noting that the past seven days has been traumatic for him. Nonetheless, he assured that adequate security had been provided, while encouraging residents not to panic.\n\nThe Governor who drove in a motorcade along with the protesters was without security details.\n\nHe was cheered and applauded by the crowd who praised him as he warned them to desist from any act of violence and not allow miscreants to hijack the peaceful protest which he witnessed personally.\n\nThere were indications that the protest will still continue tomorrow according to the organisers.\n\nMeanwhile two of the organisers told reporters that the protests was organized in a peaceful manner and they took every precautionary measure to forstall it being hijacked by hoodlums.\n\nThe coordinator of the Socialists party and human rights activist, Abiodun Bamigboye who spoke with reporters at the Mokola Roundabout, said the protest became necessary on Democracy day to let the government know that they must have solutions to the various challenges staring Nigerians in the face.\n\nHe lamented that insecurity in Nigeria has become worrisome, and has instilled fears into the people who now find it difficult to move freely and do their legitimate businesses in accordance with the \u013aaws of the land.\n\nHe called on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Fulani herdsmen who who have turned to terrorists to order in order to prevent anarchy in Nigeria.\n\nThe issue of insecurity, he argued, must be tackled decisively to stop agitations of secession going on across the country.\n\nAlso the the youthful coordinator and also activist who led the protest of the African Action Congress (AAC), Eniola Solomon, said they were not protesting or agitating for secession but to make Nigeria workable and a country where youth would be able to express themselves, get gainful employment, do legitimate business and even engage in farming which they can\u2019t do now as a result of Fulani bandits and herdsmen who kill, kidnap and demand ransome at will.\n\nHe said there must be an end to impunity by government especially at the federal level where few people believed that they own Nigeria and whatever they say or do is the final without engaging the opinions of others.\n\nHe called for the prosecution of the police officer that allegedly shot activist, Omoyele Showore.",

And any group of person that is trying to be corrupt in a particular government should be made to face the full wrath of law,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, used the occasion to appeal to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to conduct local government elections, saying local government election was essential in democracy as it\u2019s stated in the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cconducting a local government election is essential in our democracy as it\u2019s stated in our constitution.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the coalition, Comrade Waheed Lawal, had in a statement to mark this year June 12, called for true federalism.\n\nLawal had said: \u201cWe believe that only true federalism, which is coming in the name of restructuring can address the challenges facing Nigeria as a country. The current government structure is responsible for the myriad of problems which is choking the country\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cAlso, it is a known fact that Nigeria\u2019s security structure has collapsed, which has thrown up a call for total overhauling of our security system.\n\n\u201cNowhere in Nigeria is safe now and we call on the President to show seriousness and political will to address the insecurity problem with action.\n\n\u201cWe also use this opportunity to call for peace and unity among Nigerians. This is a tough period for us all, but disintegration is not the solution. Our strength lies in unity of purpose.\u201d",

          "title": "Dreams still unfulfilled, nothing to cheer about 22 years\u2019 civil rule \u2013Families of democracy heroes",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s return to democratic rule in 1999 was not attained on a silver platter.\n\nMany democrats and progressives endured piercing jackboots of despotic military juntas to the detriment of their lives and family safety.\n\nThe military dubiously hinged its incursion into politics on a duty to reverse what it termed the corrupt antics of civilians. But it pathetically ended up like a physician who left an ailment worse than he met it. It exhibited intense anti-democratic acts.\n\nThe dark days of the military in the country\u2019s political space was challenged by the finest of Nigeria\u2019s heroes who gave their all for a better Nigeria. They ranged from lawyers, journalists, politicians, labour leaders, activists to academicians among others.\n\nThe despots dangled three dangerous options before the enigmatic heroes for daring to seek a better deal for the country. They were to choose from exile, prison or grave. While some lost their lives to the struggle for a new Nigeria, others are alive to tell tales of the excruciating moments.\n\nSome of the heroes of the democratic struggle included the late Chief MKO Abiola, acclaimed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election and his late wife, Kudirat Abiola, Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, Chief Frank Kokori, who served as the secretary-general of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers during the period, Colonel Abubakar Umar (retd), who also opposed the annulment despite serving under the military dictator, Gen.\n\nIbrahim Babangida, who annulled the election dubbed the freest and fairest in the country\u2019s electoral space, the late Chief Gani Fawehimi, a dogged lawyer, Beko Ransome-Kuti, a human rights defender, National Democratic Coalition chieftain, Chief Ayo Opadokun, and one of Nigeria\u2019s distinguished journalists and ex-governor of Ogun State, Chief Olusegun Osoba.\n\nLate Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu (retd.)\n\nOther remarkable individuals who were also in the trenches were the late Pa Alfred Rewane, a NADECO financier in the post-June 12 struggle, a former president of the Nigerian Bar Association, Alao Aka-Basorun, the late Pa Abraham Adesanya, who was leader of the Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, the late Dr. Tunji Braithwaite, a lawyer, activist and politician, the late Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu (retd.), who was a NADECO leader, the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, Bolaji Akinyemi, Olisa Agbakoba, Shehu Sani, Yinka and Joe-Oke-Odumakin, Femi Falana, Debo Adeniran, Pa Anthony Enahoro, Dele Momodu, Chima Ubani, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa and James Bagauda-Kaltho among numerous others.\n\nSome of the family members of the dead heroes who spoke with Saturday PUNCH noted that the country was still sadly entangled in difficulties despite 22 years of democracy and sacrifices of their loved ones for a better and just Nigeria.\n\n22 years of civil rule\n\nThe first child of the late Chief Abraham Adesanya, Mr Adebayo Adesanya, said the current democratic experience wasn\u2019t what his father fought for.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe can\u2019t even call this democracy because devolution of power is missing across the states. The states should be able to control their resources and pay something like royalties to the Federal Government.\n\nThe Federal Government is currently encumbered with many things. In fact, most of the things it takes unto itself should be for the states and local governments. There ought to be state police. Imagine posting a police officer from the North to be a Divisional Police Officer in Lagos for example.\n\nIf there is a crisis in an area, it will take time for him to know the dimensions and terrains of the issues in that area. But if it\u2019s through state police, the men would have been familiar with the area and tackle any threats that arise. Each state should control their resources.\u201d\n\nThe septuagenarian noted that when he was younger he usually envisioned the height the Western Region would attain considering the developmental strides of the late Premier of the region, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe late Chief Obafemi Awolowo was prudent and cerebral. If states are not granted what they deserved through federalism, issues affecting the country will not abate.\u201d\n\nHe noted that restructuring was a way to have a workable country and solution to the challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cWe must all come together and decide how to restructure the country. We have to restructure Nigeria. That\u2019s the only way,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn her part, Mrs Martha Bagauda-Kaltho, said the 22 years of democracy in the country had not in any way deepened her husband\u2019s dream for the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe present democracy is not what my husband fought and died for. The country my husband and his group were pushing for was a thriving country where true democracy will prevail and will be peaceful and secure for all. Instead what we have now is a country where we all live in fear \u2013 fear to go about our daily lives and fear to speak up concerning the wrongs in our society.\u2019\u2019\n\nREAD ALSO: June 12: Sustained democracy proof Nigerians want peace \u2013 Obasa\n\nShe added that nowhere was safe in the country insurgency, robbery, kidnapping and banditry had taken over everywhere in the country including villages.\n\nBagauda-Kaltho stated, \u201cEven the villages are not spared of the horrible development. Kidnapping is now an epidemic in Nigeria. There\u2019s no value for life anymore. My husband and others fought and desired a peaceful and just Nigeria where individuals and their ideals can live and thrive without fear.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe said if the dead could return to behold what the country they died for had become, they would weep. The woman said, \u201cThey would feel bad that they died for the country in vain. What we currently practise in Nigeria is not democracy. It should be given another name.\u201d\n\nShe further said the economic situation in the country was terrible, adding that most families were unable to afford three meals daily.\n\n\u201cThey have to skip certain meals to get by. Nobody wants this. It is not a sign of a country with a healthy democracy,\u2019\u2019 she noted.\n\nShe said the elite on the other hand were only fighting for themselves and focussed on how to further enrich themselves.\n\nBagauda-Kaltho said, \u201cWhat they do not realise is that the insecurity and type of democracy in the country will eventually get to them one day. No one is exempt from it.\u201d\n\nNoting that it would be hard to attain the ideal democracy people like her husband died for, she stated that everyone must join hands to rebuild the country since it was some Nigerians who stunted its growth.\n\nShe stated, \u201cReligious leaders from all divides have a huge role to play. They must all advance the ideals of religious tolerance. I fondly remember my husband every day. I even dreamt of him a few days ago. There\u2019s no time I do not think of him. Unless I am no more, I will always think fondly of him. He is a part of me.\u201d\n\nThe late Kanu\u2019s first child, Simone Nenna Abiona, said the current democracy didn\u2019t imbibe her father\u2019s aspirations for Nigeria.\n\nAbiona said, \u201cFrom my perspective, I don\u2019t think so. He expected and hoped for a more unified Nigeria with a more balanced sharing of power. In my opinion, he would have still been fighting for Nigeria to become a true democracy with actual representation \u2018of the people, for the people, by the people\u2019. We are still not at the point of true representation at the federal level. There is no true \u2018balance of power\u2019 where each of the groups that make up Nigeria is truly represented.\u2019\u2019\n\nRead Also\n\nJune 12: Why we dispersed protesters in Abuja \u2014Police\n\nJune 12: FG yet to fulfil promises, says MKO Abiola family\n\nJune 12: End attacks on peaceful protesters, Amnesty tells FG\n\nShe added that she was of the opinion that her father would have liked to see better representation of all states at the federal level, equitable distribution/allocation of the tools and resources required to make Nigeria a more productive nation.\n\nShe noted, \u201cWhen everyone has a hand in building the country, there is a better chance at achieving a true democracy as everyone- or at least most people will be more interested in working on seeing that Nigeria is unified, and that the government is truly of, for, and by the people.\u2019\u2019\n\nSpeaking about Tunji Braithwaite who was a lawyer and firm believer against military oppression, his son, Olumide, said that the democratic ideals that people like his father stood for were not being represented in the country.\n\nHe said the ideals of any democracy was the constitution, adding that his father vehemently opposed the 1999 constitution because he felt it was an aberration to the freedom of the people.\n\nOlumide stated, \u201cHe felt that the constitution could not deliver true democracy because of the way it was put together by the military.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, to judge any country one only needs to examine its dividends to the people. He noted, \u201cWhat can we say are the dividends of Nigeria\u2019s democracy? All I can see is chaos and poverty. Something has drastically gone wrong with our version of democracy,\u2019\u2019\n\nOlumide stated that in any institution or government, the success or failure of an organisation was hinged primarily on the vision of the leader and the attitude of the followers.\n\nHe said, \u201cGood leadership and good followership are the ideals of a thriving and functional democracy. If you have good leadership and bad followers, there is still a lot that can be done to maintain order and even eventually harmonise the two. People are naturally drawn to leaders, especially good leaders. Unfortunately, we have never had good leaders in the country. If you look around the country, people who are not politicians may run the affairs of Nigeria better but for the fear of certain factors, they stay away. My father did not need to go into politics for its monetary rewards. He was doing fine without politics. But when you open your eyes to the sufferings of the common Nigerians, you can never close them again and that was what drove people like my father.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe explained that people deserved good leadership, noting that the country had only got self-centred and irresponsible leaders.\n\nHe said to reclaim the country, the youth were needed, adding that it was ironic that they had power but hadn\u2019t realised the power they wielded.\n\nOlumide added, \u201cThe youth are the future and if they can be better organised like what was witnessed during the #EndSARS protests, they can achieve anything. I say this all the time that the youth might not have money but they have numbers. They have youthful exuberance and intelligence. If the political parties available are not good for the youth, they can seek alternative ones. This country is too diverse to be ruled by two political parties for the last 22 years.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that his foundation had recently launched what he called Braithwaite TV to educate the youth on history and current affairs.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we teach them is how to recall a member of the House representing their constituency. There is a procedure for recalling non-performing elected representatives,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged Nigerians to change the values in their families, arguing that the good values were being eroded. \u201cThe fabrics of our societal morals have been eroded; we now have people who do not care how they make money. We can continue blaming leaders for as long as we want, but we have a big role to play in the achievement of an ideal society and democracy,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday PUNCH, Jamiu Abiola, a son of the late Chief MKO Abiola and Mrs Kudirat Abiola, said the calls for restructuring were loud, adding that what its advocates should do was to at least recognise that a form of restructuring was taking place. Jamiu said, \u201cAs you know, the Federal Government is promoting judicial and local government autonomy. To me, these are steps that should take place before a country can be ready for restructuring. With regard to the state of democracy, I think that the burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission has put it in danger. There is a plan to ensure that no voting takes place in certain parts of the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nCommenting on the issue, a former president of the Campaign for Democracy, Mr Mashood Erubami, said the demands of Nigerians in celebrating Democracy Day should be upgraded to call for genuine democracy and true federalism.\n\nHe stated that such fiscal federalism should authenticate control of revenues through a bottom-up approach, creation of state police and allowing states to control agriculture, health, infrastructure, education and security.\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria is dangerously moving towards the 2023 general elections, the demands for equity in the de-annulment of June 12 should interrogate the totality of its unmet expectations which reside in the denial of the inherent victories. Chief M.K.O Abiola in his vision before joining the Social Democratic Party, prepared vigorously and identified issues he believed were the bane of the country\u2019s development and was set to \u2018uplift, rebuild and restore hopes\u2019 of Nigerians with the purposes of saying \u2018farewell to poverty\u2019,\u2019\u2019 he noted.\n\nErubami further said that painfully the death of Chief M.K.O. Abiola and his wife, Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, including assassinations of many democrats who participated in the June 12 struggles were part of the irreparable losses from the annulment.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate Democracy Day, Nigerians have yet to be satisfied with what had been granted so far because the fundamental frameworks set to be achieved by June 12 in 1993 have yet to be achieved.\n\n1993 was to be a year of hope, fulfilment for the ethnic nationalities, youths, women, and every citizen, when it was planned that hunger and poverty were to be bidden farewell. Astonishingly, the hopes of Nigerians have continuously been dashed,\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\nSaying Nigeria must be governed under true federalism with unbiased devolution of powers, fiscal federalism, with the centre thoroughly unbundled. Erubami urged Nigerians to demand for true democracy in the \u2018country where corruption shall be vigorously and non-selectively fought and defeated.\u2019\u2019\n\nSource: Punch",

He said 67 bodies were seen in the village and 26 others outside the village after the attack.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are non-Nigerians. They spoke French and wore long-plaited hair. Most of them were dark and short,\u201d he said.\n\nDansani lamented that security personnel were nowhere to be found during the hours of the attack.\n\nWhen contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Husaini Rabiu, said he had visited the scene of the crime in company with the Speaker of the House of Assembly.\n\nRabiu also said those that were killed had been buried according to Islamic rites.\n\nHe said, \u201cI visited the scene and mobilised our men to secure the area. Those killed had been buried according to Islamic rites.\n\n\u201cI cannot say the exact number of those that were killed, but the Divisional Police Officer counted over 40 corpses.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has officially flagged off commercial operations of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway project yesterday.\n\nThe President while speaking at the flag off ceremony at the Mobolaji Johnson Railway Station, Ebute Metta, Lagos, said the project signals yet another milestone in the drive of the Buhari Administration to revitalize the railway system, establish it as a choice mode of transportation for both passengers and freight and position it as a transportation backbone that can transform industrial and economic activity in the country.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the project is a vital line that establishes an end-to-end logistic supply chain in railway transport within its short corridor, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan, as goods to the hinterland would now be transported by rail directly from the Apapa port Quayside straight to the Inland Container Depot located in Ibadan from where it can be distributed to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201d In clear recognition of the challenges posed to our economic growth by absence of strong and effective infrastructure, we have in the rail sector, further to other ongoing railway infrastructure projects, embarked on the completion of the outstanding segment of the Lagos \u2013 Kano railway, which is Ibadan \u2013 Kano.\n\n\u201d The Lagos \u2013 Kano railway project when completed will link the Kano \u2013 Maradi line at Kano and a rail link from the Nigeria southern ports of Lagos to Maradi in Niger Republic will be achieved.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that the connection through rail would position Nigerian ports as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic and it would be beneficial to the economy through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation.\n\nHe revealed that the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Finance have been directed to vigorously act on engagement and reaching financial agreements with appropriate co-financiers to partner with the Federal Government for the development of the Ibadan \u2013 Kano railway and the connection to the Tin Can Island port as well as the West \u2013 East Coastal rail line from Lagos to Calabar linking Onitsha, Benin, Warri, Yenagoa, Port Harcourt, Aba and Uyo.\n\n\u201d This is already yielding the desired result as construction activities on the railway segment, Kaduna \u2013 Kano has commenced with back-end engineering activities.\n\nDistinguished guests, from the beginning of this administration, railway infrastructure development has been given the priority it deserves and various milestones have been reached, right from when the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway was flagged-off for commercial operation in 2016 to this Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project being commissioned today for full commercial operation.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, for his drive and tenacity towards achieving the milestone recorded today, as well as the wonderful team in the Ministry that assisted in achieving this feat.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi earlier in his remarks expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for summoning the courage to take the loan from China Exim bank to execute the rail project.\n\nHe also thanked the Chinese government for the loan with the hope that the Asian country will also approve the loan for the Ibadan to Kano axis which he said the Buhari led administration intends to start and complete before the end of its tenure.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Chinese government through the China Exim bank was able to give us the loan at a concessionary rate to construct from the seaport down to Ibadan.\n\n\u201c We hope that we get money to be able to construct from Ibadan -Kano so that we can complete the track and make sure that business takes place,\u201d he said\n\nThe Board Chairman, Nigerian Railway Commission NRC in his welcome address reiterated that the importance of the project cannot be over emphasized as it would be of great impact to the Nation\u2019s citizens and her economy.\n\nThanking President Buhari for his support in ensuring the project is a success, he stressed that the occasion is the third time of the President commissioning railway project completed during his tenure.\n\nHe equally thanked the Minister for being the chief pilot of the project in which the project wouldnt have been successful without his tenacity.\n\nDignitries at the event include Professor Wole Soyinka, Minsters of Info and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed , Works and Housing SAN Babatunde Fashola, Youth and Sports, Dr Sunday Dare, Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Minister of State for Transport, Sen Gbemisola Saraki, Perm Sec Dr. Magdalene Ajani.

No importer or agent has however come forward in respect of the container but efforts are ongoing to track the owner for further investigation and prosecution.\n\nIn a related development, NDLEA operatives at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, NAIA, have seized nine cartons of khat, weighing 146.95kilograms at the cargo wing of the airport.\n\nThe consignment packaged as dried green tea was shipped from Addis Ababa, on board Ethiopian airline flight ET911.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter initial examination and suspicion, a clearing agent was asked to report with the consignee before the release but failed to do so for fear of arrest, a development that led to a laboratory test on the consignment, which tested positive to khat and the eventual seizure.\n\nChairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. General Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has hailed the synergy among various government agencies at the Onne port and charged them not to rest on their oars as they daily work hard to keep Nigeria safe. He particularly commended the Commander, officers and men of the Port Harcourt Port Command and their Abuja airport Command counterparts for their vigilance and commitment to the task of ridding Nigeria of illicit drugs.\n\n\u201cThe damage 100,000 bottles of codeine would have done to our youths if they had slipped through the port to our villages, towns and cities is unimaginable. 146.95 kilograms of khat could have done the same damage if allowed to go into our streets. We\u2019ll continue to motivate our officers and men so that they can give their best in the discharge of their responsibilities across the country and ultimately with the support of all our stakeholders and partners, we\u2019ll win the battle against illicit drug trafficking and abuse\u201d, Gen.
