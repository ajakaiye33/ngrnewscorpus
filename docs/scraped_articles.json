          "title": "Incessant killings: Plateau, Benue gunmen kill 44, youths deposit corpses at Government House",
          "text": "\u2022 Eat dead bodies if you can\u2019t protect us, protesting Plateau youths tell govt officials\n\n\u2022 Protesters destroy governor\u2019s billboard\n\n\u2022 Lalong re-imposes 24-hour curfew\n\nProtests on Wednesday rocked Jos, the Plateau State capital, following the killing of 36 persons in an attack on the Yelwa Zangam community in the Jos North Local Government Area of the state on Tuesday.\n\nThis was just as eight persons were allegedly killed by suspected herders in the Yelwata community, Guma Local Government Area of Benue State on Tuesday.Several people were said to have been injured and one person was allegedly abducted during the attack.\n\nAngry youths stormed some hospitals, including the Plateau State Specialist Hospital, Jos, where they seized corpses of the victims of the attack, went round with them in a truck before depositing them at the Government House.\n\nThere was tension in the local government following the attack as youths berated the state government for failing to protect the residents.\n\nRecall that there was tension in Jos on August 14, when a group of youths along the Rukuba Road in the Jos North Local Government Area killed 22 persons, who were among passengers of five buses being conveyed from Bauchi State to Ikare Akoko in Ondo State.\n\nThe travellers had gone back to Bauchi State for an Islamic programme and were on their way back to Ondo State when they were attacked.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jos was enveloped in tension again following the killing of 35 persons in Ahwol Ward of the Naraguta community in the same local government area the previous night.\n\nIt was learnt that around 10pm on Tuesday, gunmen stormed the Yelwa Zangam community and killed no fewer than 36 persons and injured many others, who were rushed to the Bingham University Teaching Hospital, Jos, for treatment.\n\nIt was gathered that when the gunmen got to the community, they were shooting in every direction before they went from house to house and gunned down many residents.\n\nThe paramount ruler of the Anaguta ethnic nationality in the state, Johnson Jauro, confirmed the attack to The PUNCH in Jos on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI have been informed that some gunmen attacked my people last night (Tuesday) in the Naraguta community with many casualties. But we are still investigating to know what really happened,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Councillor for the Ahwol Ward, Yusuf Ali, who also confirmed the attack, said more than 20 persons were burnt alive in the affected area.\n\nAnother resident, Jeremiah Bulus, said, \u201cSixteen additional corpses have been taken to the mortuary this morning and people are still making efforts to recover more corpses from several houses, which the gunmen set ablaze. The situation is really bad for the people.\u201d\n\nGunmen destroyed bridge, stop troops rescue mission\n\nAccording to the councillor, the gunmen first destroyed the iron bridge linking the community before attacking the residents, which made it difficult for security agents to access the area when they were contacted about the attack.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe gunmen were just shooting in every direction when they arrived in the community around 10pm. For now, more than 10 dead bodies have been recovered and we are still searching for more victims, because the shooting was heavy.\n\n\u201cWhile the attack was going on, the chairman of the local government called the security agents to mobilise to the area, but it was discovered that the gunmen had destroyed the iron bridge linking the community.\n\n\u201cThey destroyed the bridge probably to prevent security agents from having access to the community so that they could execute their evil agenda unhindered and that was exactly what happened. We are in pain because our people have been cheated.\u201d\n\nA few hours after the attack, it was gathered that angry protesters stormed some hospitals, including the Plateau State Specialist Hospital, Jos, where the corpses of the victims were deposited.\n\nEyewitnesses said the protesters dragged about 15 corpses into a waiting van and marched through the state House of Assembly complex to the Little Rayfield Government House, where they deposited them in front of the two gates.\n\nIt was learnt that at the roundabout in front of the Little Rayfield Government House, the protesters destroyed Governor Simon Lalong\u2019s giant billboard that had the inscription, \u2018Peace, unity and progress\u2019.\n\nThey were, however, prevented from entering the Government House by security operatives, who mounted roadblocks at the road leading to the gates.\n\nThe security agents also fired teargas canisters to disperse the surging protesters, but the irate youths took the corpses in the vehicle from the roundabout and made their way to the front of the Government House gate, where they dumped the corpses one after another.\n\nOne of the protesters, Yusuf Jeremiah, who said he took five of the corpses to the Government House gate, told The PUNCH that the youths were not happy with the government\u2019s handling of the security situation in the state.\n\nJeremiah said, \u201cHow can we have a government in place and over 36 persons were killed in a community without anything being done to stop the attackers? What is the job of those in government if it cannot protect the lives and property of the people? Is it that those in government want to eat the bodies of those killed? If that is what they want, we have decided to bring the dead bodies to the Government House.\n\nAnother protester, who refused to give his name, said, \u201cThe killings are too much in the state. There is hardly a day without stories of attacks and killings. For how long shall we continue like this? All through the time the protest lasted in front of the Government House, no government official came out to address us. So, we left the corpses for them there.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the corpses were later evacuated and taken back to the morgue by security operatives.\n\nThe spokesman for the Plateau Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, could not be reached for comments.\n\nDestruction of community\u2019s access bridge slowed down rescue efforts \u2013 Army\n\nBut the Operation Safe Haven, in a statement by its spokesman, Ishaku Takwa, said the troops mobilised to save the community were slowed down by the destruction of the link bridge by the marauders.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe attackers came in the night and started shooting unsuspecting members of the community from house to house. The gunmen also destroyed houses and the bridge linking the town to the community, making access to the area difficult for security agencies.\n\n\u201cTroops of the Operation Safe Haven, who were mobilised to save the community, were slowed down by the destruction of the bridge by the marauders.\n\nLalong re-imposes 24-hour curfew on Jos North LGA\n\nAs a result of the incident, Lalong re-imposed a 24-hour curfew on the Jos North Local Government Area.\n\nThe 24-hour curfew earlier imposed on the council area alongside Jos South and Bassa by the governor was relaxed last week from dusk to dawn.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Governor\u2019s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Government House, Macham Makut, said the decision to re-impose the curfew, which began by 4pm on Wednesday, followed imminent threat to lives and property in the area.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe Plateau State Government has reinstated the 24-hour curfew earlier relaxed in the Jos North Local Government Area following growing tension arising from the attack on Yelwa Zangam village of the local government, where people were killed and properties destroyed.\n\n\u201cAccording to Governor Simon Lalong, the 24-hour curfew will come into force from 4pm today, Wednesday, August 25, 2021, until further notice.\n\n\u201cThe proactive decision became necessary following imminent threat to lives and property within the local government area and the need to forestall the breakdown of law and order. It will also enable security agencies to deploy appropriately to maintain security as the search for the attackers of the villagers continues.\u201d\n\nCAN condemns killings, demands compensation for bereaved families\n\nMeanwhile, the Christian Association of Nigeria, Jos North chapter, has condemned the fresh killings.\n\nThe association put the number of casualties at 40.\n\nIt said this on Wednesday in a statement signed by the Coordinator, CAN, Jos North, Rev Polycarp Gana, and Secretary, Rev Ezekiel Nyam.\n\nThe body added that four houses were burnt during the mayhem.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cWe reiterate and condemn aggressively these killings and attacks on innocent citizens in their homes and the provocative statements by clerics, who should be preaching understanding and solidarity to fish out the bad eggs in our communities.\n\n\u201cWe condemn provocative statements at these times when we should be trying to assuage frayed nerves with words from the holy books, which should build rather than further tear apart.\n\n\u201cCAN calls on the government to visit and compensate the families of the victims affected by the incident and appeals to Christians to stand firm and defend themselves.\u201d\n\n10 suspects have been arrested, says Lalong\n\nLalong later confirmed that 10 persons had been arrested in connection with the attack.\n\nThe governor, who condemned the fresh attack in a statement by Makut, warned that those behind the killings would not go unpunished\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cGovernor Simon Bako Lalong is appalled by yet another isolated attack, which took place at the Yelwa Zangam village of the Jos North Local Government Area on Tuesday night, where properties were destroyed and some people killed.\n\n\u201cThe governor totally condemns this barbaric act and directs security agencies, which have already arrested 10 suspects in connection with the attack, to intensify efforts in tracking down the other assailants and their sponsors in order to bring them to justice.\n\nGombe gov decries reprisals in Plateau\n\nGombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, has condemned the reprisals that followed the recent killings in Jos, Plateau State, urging residents to remain calm.\n\nYahaya spoke at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Wednesday, after meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

But helplessly, I found myself following him. He asked me about my parents and I realized I was answering him and was responding to all his questions.\n\n\u201cHe asked me to place a call to my father who is living abroad to request money. I agreed to that and we got to Ojota.\n\n\u201cWe entered vehicle going to Ore.\n\nWhen we got to Ore, the driver asked me to pay my transport fare.\n\n\u201d lt was when he took the bag from me that I regained my memory and realized that I\u2019m already in Ondo state.\n\n\u201cAn argument broke out which attracted the attention of the Amotekun men who eventually rescued me from the man.\n\nThe suspect said he was an ex- herbalist and denied hypnotising the victim after he helped him to carry his bag\n\nThe State commander of Amotekun, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said \u201cMen of our Intelligent unit posted around motor parks in Ore noticed some funny behaviour between the young man and the suspect.\n\n\u201cOn questioning, they found out that the boy did not know how he gets to Ore. As far as the boy is concerned, he thought he was in Lagos.\n\n\u201cOn interrogation, we realized he has debriefed the boy and found out his father lives abroad and asked the boy to call his father to send money while being hypnotised.\n\n\u201cHe was brought to the headquarter and we got a clue that his mother lives in Lagos and placed a call to her.\n\nAdeleye advised parents to teach their wards to abstain totally from strangers.\n\n\u201cYes, we were thought to render helps to the elderly, but nowadays it has become the other way round in our society today.\n\n\u201cSomebody respectfully assisted an elderly person not knowing he is a spiritualist. I think our children should be wary of visitors and be mindful of who they assist.\n\nAdeleye added that the suspect will soon be charged to court.\n\nThe 42-year-old mother of the victim, Mrs Rashidat Babatunde who lives with her four children in No 5. Sewumi street Mushin, Lagos State said, \u201cI got a call at about past three from somebody that said he was calling from Amotekun.\n\n\u201cI told the person that I don\u2019t know what they call Amotekun and that and I have not been to Akure before.\n\nHe said my son who left home at about 9 am for where he was receiving training as a mechanic was found in Ondo state. Honestly, I was confused.\n\n\u201cI was directed to go to Ojota and board a vehicle to Akure and that when I get to Akure, I should ask of Amotekun headquarters.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Corps for such an unbelievable gesture which rescued my son from his captor.\n\nThe food vendor added that \u201cI was not charged in any way, my son was handed over to me peacefully. I say kudos to the Ondo state government for setting up such an agency that is reliable and dependable\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The manufacturer said the vehicle was made for use in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe complaint sheet informed the court that the vehicle, which did not meet U.S. safety standards, was stolen and shipped to Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub.\n\nThe XKR was seized on June 15, 2011 at the Los Angeles/Long Beach seaport in California, United States.\n\nKachikwu admitted to the forfeiture of the vehicle and agreed to pay $10,000 instead of the vehicle being confiscated.

Chibuike recalled that after some period of use, Kachikwu exported it to the U.S. \u201cas a gift to a relation\u201d.\n\nChibuike admitted that the customs impounded the car because it was not built for American roads, based on emission control reasons and on the suspicion that it was stolen.\n\n\u201cDr. Kachikwu gave them the details of the car and they reached out to the car dealer, who corroborated his narration and validated his innocence.\n\n\u201cHowever, while it couldn\u2019t be proven and established that the car might have been stolen in Europe, it was based on the emission control concerns that an administrative ruling was given in the US that the car be taken back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe statement said once the customs determined there was no reason to continue to impound the car or charge the dealer, \u201cthe car was released to Kachikwu, who returned it to the dealer and got a refund\u201d.\n\nChibuike added that the matter happened years before President Muhammadu Buhari appointed his principal a minister.",

          "text": "NWC affirms Akinwonmi\n\nGovernors meet on crisis\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leadership crisis was aggravated by the antagonistic positions of the competing forces on zoning of party offices and the 2023 presidential ticket, it was learnt last night.\n\nThe party\u2019s governors are meeting today in Abuja to deliberate on the lingering disagreement to chart a path towards a solution.\n\nYesterday, prominent party chieftains, including members of the National Working Committee (NWC) resolved to back Elder Yemi Akinwonmi as acting chairman in accordance with party constitution.\n\nParty youths under the aegis of the PDP Youths Movement, led by Salaudeen Lukman, warned that the party might not bounce back to power in 2023, should the crisis persist.\n\nAccording to a source, anti-Uche Secondus forces want the suspended national chairman to vacate office to prevent him from taking charge of the preparations for the convention, particularly the composition of the Convention Planning Committee.\n\nIt is believed that the composition of the Convention Committee will solidify Secondus\u2019 influence and hold on the processes that will lead to the emergence of new National Working Committee (NWC) and National Executive Committee (NEC), the source added.\n\nConfirming today\u2019s PDP governors\u2019 meeting, Director-General, PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, C.I.D Maduabum, said in a statement that the emergency meeting was summoned by its Chairman and governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, in consultation with his colleagues.\n\nHe said the meeting slated for 5pm would discuss recent developments in the party.\n\nThe forum enjoined PDP members and stakeholders to exercise patience as efforts were on to ensure the stability of the party in the days ahead.\n\nMany members of the NWC yesterday resolved to back Akinwonmi as acting chairman.\n\nThe decision has put paid to claims by the Deputy National Chairman (North), Suleiman Nazif who on Tuesday, declared himself Acting Chairman.\n\nA source said NWC members were unanimous in their decision to recognise Akinwonmi as Acting Chairman.\n\nAkinwonmi, who resumed office on Wednesday, had a meeting with some members of the NWC in the chairman\u2019s office located on the second floor of the national secretariat.\n\nThe meeting, which lasted for about one hour, ended at about 5.35pm. Some of the NWC members who attended the meeting included the National Secretary, Senator Umar Tsauri, the Organising Secretary, Col. Austin Akobundu; National Youth Leader, Sunday Udeh-Okoye; National Treasurer, Adewale Aribisala; and the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan.\n\nAccording to the source, the NWC members will take a common position that would be presented at the NEC meeting scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nThe source however, declined comments on whether or not Nazif, who did not attend the meeting, was privy to the decision to recognise Akinwonmi as Acting Chairman.\n\nCalls to Nazif\u2019s mobile telephone number did not connect. A text message sent to him seeking his comments had not been responded to at the time of filing this report.\n\nAnother group, \u201cPDP Action 2023\u201d, urged former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to work with other stakeholders in finding lasting solutions to the leadership crisis.\n\nIn a statement by its chairman, Rufus Omeire, the group called on Atiku to drop his purported interest in the 2023 contest and lead the efforts to rebuild and reposition the party for future elections.\n\nParty youth leader Lukman, in a statement, warned that the crisis may consume the party ahead of the 2023 poll.\n\nHe attributed the crisis to the antics of external forces sponsored by the ruling party to destabilise PDP.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLukman said: \u201cA similar style was adopted, prior to the 2015 general election, towards the tail end of Alh Bananga Tukur regime as National Chairman. An externally-sponsored crisis threw the party into internal crisis, which degenerated to the extent it later paved way for a mole into Wadata Plaza who further destabilised PDP to enable the APC win the 2015 general elections.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were terrified by the news of a court order secured by purported PDP members from Rivers State, who are obviously serving the interest of the ruling APC against the outgoing national chairman of our dear party Uche Secondus.\u201d",

          "title": "Leaders need more than piety to run government",
          "text": "Most Nigerians will readily attest to the fact that both President Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo are pious men. Their immeasurable piousness was perhaps their major asset during the 2015 election. It was mainly because of their Muslim and Christian credentials that the masses of poor Nigerians who as a result of cultural imperialism believe they are holier than Sheikh Abdul Rehman Al Sadais, the chief Iman of Mecca or Pope Francis in Rome, elected these two devout leaders into power. And they have not disappointed us as the two pious men have continued to live and govern by faith.\n\nPastor Osinbajo speaking at the interdenominational church service for the 2018 Armed forces Day Celebration in Abuja on January 5 2018, said \u201cas dangerous, deadly and heartless as killings by Fulani herdsmen in Adamawa, Benue and Jos were, retaliation was not the answer\u201d. His message was that of forgiveness.\n\nIn the same vein, on January 2018 while president Buhari was assuring grieving Benue delegation of political, traditional rulers and elders of Benue led by Governor Ortom after mass burial of victims of marauding herdsmen, that the perpetrators would be brought to book, he appealed to them saying \u201cin the name of God accommodate your country men\u201d. His was also a message of forgiveness.\n\nWas forgiveness not what all the Holy books, the Bible and the Quran prescribed? : \u201cO my Servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah: for Allah forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful..( Surah Ghafir, verse 55 ) \u201cThough your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool..( Isaiah 1:18) And when Peter asked Jesus \u201cLord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cI do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.( Matthew 18: 21-22)\n\nThe setting up and the launching of \u2018Operation Safe Corridor\u2019, an initiative for the de-radicalisation and rehabilitation of ex-Boko Haram members and their reintegration back into society by President Buhari\u2019s government in 2016 therefore fitted perfectly into the mindset of our pious leaders. But five years into the launching of the initiative, killings, whether in the name of Boko-Haram, Bandits or Fulani herdsmen have continued in north western states of Sokoto, Zanfara, Katsina and Kaduna where 222 persons were killed with 774 others kidnapped between May and July 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd without succor for about 350, 000 killed, 3m displaced and over 310,000 driven by insurgents from their communities marooned in IDP camps before the take-off of the project, people read injustice into pampering of criminals that had visited so much sorrow on Nigerians. As asked by Bishop Kukah \u201cWhy should rehabilitating those that declared war against Nigerians , murdered thousands of citizens, destroyed infrastructure and rendered entire families permanently displaced and dislocated than victims in IDP camps\u201d?.\n\nBesides Soldiers at the war front in the north-east who expressed misgivings about the release of repentant Boko Haram suspects, some residents of Borno in July 2020, kicked against the reintegration of repentant Boko-Haram members into their communities, asking the federal government to take them to Aso Rock.\n\nBut questioning the success of this federal government pet-project last week during the surrender of 1,000 repentant Boko Haram terrorists and about 200 other Nigeria ex-militants from Cameroon, Governor Babagana Zulum, said while he was not opposed to federal government policy he observed \u201c no one will find it easy that killers of his or her children and other loved ones including our courageous soldiers and volunteers who have lost colleagues..\u201d are integrated without paying or atoning for their sins. He further claimed that \u201cquite often those who have passed through the Safe Corridor initiative, usually go back and rejoin the terror group after carefully studying the various security arrangements in their host communities, during the reintegration process\u201d. He then called for the review of \u201cthe whole idea of de-radicalisation, as currently being implemented, to ensure the main goals and the underlying objectives behind the initiative are achieved.\u201d His recommendation therefore include: immediately prosecution of the insurgents in accordance with the terrorism Act and devolution of the powers of the minister of justice and attorney-general of the federation to state attorneys-general in order to facilitate the prosecution process,\u201d\n\nBut our pious leaders driven by his sense of self-righteousness have shown no inclination towards changing their strategy. But instead, from far away Washington DC came support from another man of faith, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture. According to him the decision by the federal government not to prosecute repentant insurgents is \u201cin line with global best practice. What they (soldiers) were doing is what the global practice dictates about soldiers that surrendered that should be treated as prisoners of war,\u201d\n\nBut how can Lai Mohammed who recently said his 7 years old grandson wanted to know why people call him \u2018lying Mohammed\u2019 pretended not knowing that Boko Haram, Bandits, Herdsmen who break all international rule of engagement by kidnapping underage female children they forced into marriage or turned into sex slaves, school children they kidnapped for ransom and indiscriminate killing of subsistence farmers, their children and wives on their farms or while sleeping in the night, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as soldiers?\n\nSupport for government also came last week from the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) The body through Is-hac Akintola, its Director has called on the Federal Government and Nigerian Army to resettle repentant Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists. The body wants \u201cReturning fighters to be treated like brothers newly found because What they need is our understanding, cooperation and kindness\u201d. The body was however silent on the needs of victims who lost their loved ones. driven from their farms and communities and are currently living in IDP camps.\n\nUnfortunately since we have all become blinded by religion, reminding those we elected on the basis of their faith that Saudi Arabia which executes people for murder, drug smuggling, rape, armed robbery, and terrorism offenses has one of the highest execution rates in the world and that the Jewish Talmud supports capital punishment especially for those who are a threats to society will not change the mindset of pious leaders driven only by sense of self-righteousness.\n\nBut as 2023 beckons, perhaps it is time to remind ourselves that government is too important to be left in the hands of pious men driven only by sense of self-righteousness. Government is a Leviathan-a huge fearful sea monster. Parts of its important task is to keep man who most of the time is insane under control just as it has to control the excesses of the rich who demand freedom for licentious lives while presiding over empire of slaves.\n\nPiety is perhaps the least attribute needed by those who want to run government. Indeed for those who intend to venture into the serious business of managing society, sincerity, candour, honesty and probity are not as important as egoism, brinkmanship and skillful exploitation of man\u2019s secret fears and infirmities.",

We have seen your reporters call us at intervals in the past to confirm stories they are writing and to get our own view on issues that affect us. This is unlike some others who pick up fake and unfounded stories to continue to misinform the reading public.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Ports Authority is a national asset created to improve port facilities across the country.\n\nIn this regard, we have been working hard to improve traffic flow around the Apapa ports corridor. We also have a mandate to improve revenue collection by minimising leakages in the ports duty collection system\u201d He said.\n\nTo achieve these lofty goals, Koko said the NPA has been collaborating with various government security agencies including NAFDAC, NDLEA, The Nigeria Police, and the Nigerian Customs Service among others.\n\nHe said the Authority recently partnered the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), to develop minimum safety standards for trucks coming into the ports to minimise some of the incidences that involve articulated trucks freighting goods and cargoes to parts of the country.\n\nOn what the NPA is doing to further improve the ports business operating environment, Koko said NPA was currently implementing the \u201cOperation 360\u201d designed to clean the Apapa corridor of illegal trailer packs, shanties and other unwanted developments around the ports facilities in Lagos, stressing that the Authority\u2019s management was also not unmindful of the presence of bad operators in the system attempting to compromise its laid down rules.\n\nHe however, expressed optimism that the Authority\u2019s ongoing reform efforts would further be bolstered upon the completion of the Lekki Deep Seaport, Badagry Deep sea port and the Ondo Deep Sea ports now under construction, adding that these facilities would ease congestion around the Lagos ports and reduce cargo traffic flows to Lome and Cotonuo ports.\n\nThe NPA boss said it was against this backdrop that he was welcoming The Sun Newspaper collaboration as timely and desirable option to fasttract the attainment of his reform goals, promising to engage further with the management to build a mutually beneficial partnership.\n\nEarlier at the occasion, Managing Director/Editor In -Chief of TheSun, Mr Onuoha Ukeh, said the visit to the Marina Corporate Head Office of NPA was informed by the management\u2019s recognition of the Authority as a critical stakeholder in both the maritime industry and the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe said he was impressed by the reforms currently being implementing by the NPA management, including its efforts at improving the Ease of Doing Business.\n\nOnuoha also commended the NPA boss for his efforts at making the Eastern seaports operational, urging him not to relent in the fight to end congestion on Lagos port roads and make it a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cWe are here to commend you and to tell you that we will partner with you. The Sun is one of the largest circulating papers in the country, printing simultaneously in Lagos, Aba, and Abuja, which helps it circulate to all states of the federation\u201d We are here to commend you and to tell you we will support your efforst to make the NPA a world -class facility and a shipping hub in West Africa.",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has again been accused of failing to restructure the country.\n\nAccording to the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) spokesman, Hakeem Baba Ahmed, the North is the first victim of President Buhari\u2019s alleged misgovernance.\n\nAhmed who spoke at the second Annual Ripples Dialogue in Lagos, claimed the president\u2019s refusal to restructure the country is indicative that things may get worse before March 2023.\n\n\u201cThe North is the first victim of President Buhari\u2019s misgovernance. We are the first victims of Boko Haram. The North supports restructuring, justice and fairplay. Secession is not a choice, what northerners are doing in the south is as important as what southerners are doing in the north.\u201d\n\nOn 2023 and power rotation, he said he was more interested in competence than the ethnic nationality or religion of the next president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what tribe or religion the next president will be, what we need is a president who can rebuild trust among Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the forum, which had as its theme: \u2018Rebuilding trust in a divided Nigeria: Advancing the conversation,\u2019 Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and Afenifere leader, Ayo Adebanjo, said they believe in a united Nigeria and stressed the need to rebuild trust among ethnic nationalities.\n\nHowever, former member of the House of Representatives, Uche Onyeaguocha, said ethnic nationalities that wished to leave the union should be allowed to secede.\n\nOkowa identified the absence of a national ideology, lack of political will to fashion a constitution that will promote true federalism, disenchantment of youths in the ability of the country to provide for them and lack of faith in the electoral process as some of the factors responsible for the trust deficit among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe crux of the matter is that the absence of a national ideology that all the component parts of the country subscribe to is why we are yet to forge that sense of oneness and unity. In the absence of a shared national vision or aspiration, primordial loyalties and sentiments largely hold sway among the citizens. The Americans have the American Dream, the British, Rule Britannia, while in recent times, the United Arab Emirate has developed a vision to be the biggest and the best in everything she does. What can we point to as Nigeria\u2019s overarching vision that motivates the average citizen or that everyone aspires to actualise? How can we have and pursue an overarching vision when we think Fulani or Hausa or Yoruba or Igbo instead of Nigeria?\u201d\n\nHe also blamed bad governance at different levels of government as a major contributory factor to disunity in the country.\n\n\u201cBad governance is what results when a state, based on the principles of democracy and social justice as Nigeria, is described in Section 14 (1) of the 1999 Constitution, fails to uphold, in all its operations, the principles of democracy and social justice\u201d; and (b) when a government fails to fulfill its primary purpose which, according to Section 14 (2) (b) of the 1999 Constitution is to provide the security and welfare of the people.\u201d\n\nOkowa said the key to building trust among Nigerians lay in electing a leader that can inspire confidence among the people.\n\n\u201cLeadership is key. As 2023 approaches, the focus should be on electing a pan -Nigerian as president, a person with the capacity and charisma to cast a vision for Nigeria and rally all Nigerians behind it. We need a selfless, sacrificial, sincere, broadminded, caring and capable president that will inspire hope and confidence in the country; a leader who values merit over mediocrity, competence over cronyism, while upholding the fundamental principles of fairness, equity and justice.\u201d\n\nIn his remark, Adebanjo said he believes in one Nigeria but the 1999 Constitution and President Muhammadu Buhari remain the greatest obstacle to trust building among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe cause of the mistrust is the 1999 constitution. Until it is changed, there will be no peace. You cannot have peace in a multi cultural, multi religious, multi ethnic society that is ruled by a unitary",

          "text": "From Gyang Bere, Jos and Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nNo fewer than 36 persons were killed yesterday morning, when suspected bandits attacked Yelwan Zangam community in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State.\n\nThe attackers defied the curfew imposed by Governor Simon Lalong and unleashed terror on women, children and aged persons. Most of the victims died of gunshots injuries while those who were butchered were burnt.\n\nThe Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) confirmed the incident. Military Information Officer, Major Ishaku Takwa, in a statement, said: \u201cThe attackers came in the night and started house to house shooting of unsuspecting members of the community. The gunmen also destroyed houses and the bridge linking the town to the community making access to the area difficult for security agencies.\n\n\u201cTroops of Operation SAFE HAVEN mobilised to save the community were slowed down by the destruction of the bridge by the marauders. Troops eventually got to the scene of the attack by navigating through other villages and met some houses already burnt and casualties recorded. Troops are in pursuit in the direction the killers fled.\u201d\n\nDavid Zaion, member of the community, said 36 bodies have been recovered while more than 20 houses were burnt. He said most of the villagers were fleeing for fear of further attack.\n\n\u201cThe bandits invaded the community in a large number in the early hours of Wednesday and killed women, children and the aged persons.\n\n\u201cWe have recovered up to 36 corpses and several others are still missing. You can see for yourself how people were butchered and roasted in their sleep.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeless at the moment, we have lost confidence in the government and security agencies. They are not doing their job the way it is supposed to be.\u201d\n\nAngry youths from the affected community conveyed bodies to the state House of Assembly to show their displeasure over the inability of legislators to come up with laws that would protect the citizens. The youths, who dumped the bodies at the Assembly complex, lamented that no government official had come to their aid since the attack occurred.\n\nThe youths later proceeded with the bodies in a vehicle to the new Government House, Rayfield, to expressed their bitterness to Governor Simon Lalong over his in ability to protect him.\n\nThey were received by the Deputy Governor, Prof. Sonni Tyoden, who pleaded for calm and assured that government would take drastic action to avert a repeat.\n\nChairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Plateau State, Rev. Fr. Polycarp Lubo, described the killings as barbaric and urged Christians in the state to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn this attack, this is inhumanity to man and it is unacceptable. I call on the Federal Government to mobilise more security to Plateau State. The security agents have been doing their best but they are not doing enough. You can see we have about 16 corpses here and we were told that several others were roasted and nobody is saying anything.\n\n\u201cThis killing was as a result of the utterances of some Islamic scholars who made nasty statements when some persons were killed a week ago. They said they were going to retaliate and this is what we are seeing. I have told the General Officer Commanding 3 Division and the Commander of the Operation Safe Haven to bring those Islamic scholars to book. I want to say nobody has right over anybody\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nHe described the recent killing as worse compare to the last killings that claimed the lives of 23 commuters who were said to be Muslim.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Assembly, Ayuba Abok, who addressed the angry youths, described the killings as unfortunate and unacceptable.\n\n\u201cI am not the governors but I am going to follow this matter to the end to ensure justice for the victims.\u201d\n\nMeranwhile, the state government has reinstated the 24-hour curfew earlier relaxed in Jos North Local Government Area following the growing tensions arising from the attack.\n\n\u201cThe proactive decision became necessary following eminent threat to lives and properties within the local government area and the need to forestall breakdown of law and order. It will also enable security agencies deploy appropriately to maintain security as the search for the attackers of the villagers continues.\u201d\n\n\u2022Why Gombe didn\u2019t experience reprisal \u2013Gov. Yahaya\n\nGovernor of Gombe state, Inuwa Yahaya has condemned the incidence that followed the recent happenings in Jos, where some travelers were killed, urging people to remain calm and desist from making reprisals.\n\nHe said his people in Gombe awere united in the determination to ward off religious and ethnic differences to sustain the existing relative peace amidst insecurity in the North East region especially in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.\n\nHe said this at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, after he met with the Chief of Staff to the President.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for helping us as far as the issue of security is concerned. We are in the midst of the North-East and we are aware of the challenges in the frontline states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa are facing so we\u2019ve tried as much as possible in order to live in peace and harmony.\n\n\u201cThis is despite our differences; religious difference, social difference and other social differences that normally cause friction among the people and we have gotten the understanding of our people and with the support of the security agencies, we\u2019ve been able to relate well and manage security in Gombe State. We are happy and by the grace of God we shall try to sustain that going forward.\u201d\n\nOn what his administration did to forestall reprisals, he said. \u201cAll stakeholders, the traditional institutions, schools and agencies that have to manage a number of people were called for a meeting at the Government House where we briefed and advised them not to make reprisal attacks.\n\n\u201cBesides that, we\u2019ve been relating with the religious authorities so that we don\u2019t have reprisal atatcks either from the Christian or Muslim sides. Mind you, a lot of families in Gombe are both Muslims and Christians and that relationship transcends current issues that are causing tension and I think we have been able to manage the matter and people are cooperating and we will continue to do that. We have security management committees in place, comprising traditional rulers, from the ward, to districts, emirates and chiefdoms, up to the State level. Therefore, we share information and manage whatever decision we take and whenever there is an issue, we nip it in the bud without allowing it to get to an alarming state or level,\u201d he explained.",

          "text": "James Emejo\n\nThe Tax Appeal Tribunal (TAT) sitting in Lagos has ordered Multichoice Nigeria Limited, DSTV, to pay 50 per cent of N1.8 trillion which the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) had determined through a forensic audit to be the amount in taxes that Multichoice Nigeria Limited had failed to pay to the federal government in past assessment years.\n\nFifty per cent of the backlog is N900 billion.\n\nThe five-member TAT led by its Chairman, Prof. A.B. Ahmed, issued the order following an application to it by the counsel to FIRS.\n\nThe FIRS Counsel made the application under Order XI of the TAT Procedure Rules 2010 which enables a party to make an application at any stage of the proceedings.\n\nCounsel for FIRS drew the attention of the Tribunal to Paragraph 15(7) of the Fifth Schedule to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 and urge the tribunal to direct Multichoice to deposit with the FIRS 50 per cent of the amount of the assessment under appeal as security and a condition that must be fulfilled before the prosecution of the appeal brought before the tribunal.\n\nThe details of the development was contained in a statement issued Wednesday by Director, Communications and Liaison Department, FIRS, Dr. Abdullahi Ismaila Ahmad.\n\nIn certain defined circumstances to which the Multichoice appeal fits, Paragraph 15(7) of the Fifth Schedule to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 (FIRS Act) requires persons or companies seeking to contest a tax assessment to pay all or a stipulated percentage of the tax assessed before they can be allowed to argue their appeal contesting the assessment at TAT, the statement added.\n\nMultichoice had filed the matter at the Lagos TAT following its dispute over FIRS\u2019 issuance of Notices of Assessment and Demand Note in the sum of N1.82 trillion on 7 April 7, 2021.\n\nThe amount constitutes what the FIRS calculated as due in taxation to the federal government from the company after an investigation over several months to determine the extent to which Multichoice had been evading taxes in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, at the Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the matter in Appeal No: TAT/LZ/CIT/062/2021 19/08/2021 (Multichoice Nigeria Limited v. Federal Inland Revenue Service), Multichoice had amended its Notice of Appeal and thereafter sought through its counsel, Bidemi Olumide of AO2 Law Firm for an adjournment of the proceedings to enable it to respond to the FIRS\u2019 formal application for accelerated hearing of the appeal and prayer before the TAT directing Multichoice to produce before the tribunal the integrated annual report and Management Account Statements of Multichoice Group Ltd for Tax Years 2012 to 2020., among other prayers.\n\nIn response, however, the FIRS counsel asked TAT to issue an order requiring that Multichoice makes the statutory deposit of 50 per cent of the disputed sum.\n\nAfter hearing arguments from both sides, TAT upheld the FIRS submission and directed Multichoice to deposit with the FIRS an amount equals 50 percent of the Assessment under the Appeal plus a sum equal to 10 per cent of the said deposit as a condition precedent for further hearing of the appeal.\n\nThereafter, TAT adjourned the appeal to September 23, 2021 for report of compliance with its order and continuation of the hearing, subject to compliance with the tribunal\u2019s order.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me in the Nigerian oil industry as well as the Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, gathered recently in a frontal display of wealth at a party organised in Abuja by the new Group Executive Director of the NNPC, Aisha Farida Katagum, to celebrate her promotion.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that the corporation incurred humongous expenses at the party where they treated themselves to the country\u2019s scarce resources like royalties.\n\n\n\nThe party is coming amid several allegations of corruption and contracts racketeering among the top workers of the corporation.\n\nThe caterer at the party reportedly provided a seven-course meal that made sure guests had the best of time, one of them added.\n\n\u201cNNPC has been highly politicised under the current administration. You will recall the announcement of promotions to top management in NNPC last week. To our great disgust, a party was thrown in Abuja to celebrate Aisha Farida Katagum who was promoted to GED Corporate Services.\n\n\u201cObviously celebrating the money and the corruption that is within reach; even the NNPC GMD, Mele Kyari was also in attendance with the musicians hailing him. Others were; the Group Executive Director (GED) finance and accounts, Umar Ajiya, the new Group General Manager (GGM) Crude oil marketing department (COMD), Mrs Rose Essiet, GGM supply chain management (SCM), Sophia Mbakwe and GGM National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), Bala Wunti.\n\n\u201cBala Wunti is well known for selling contracts in NNPC; he and other top management staff were dancing at a party few days after the promotions were announced.\n\n\u201cThese people are clearly not focused on the task ahead but celebrating corruption. This is very unbecoming of technocrats in a crass display of unprofessionalism,\u201d a top source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSome of the top management staff of NNPC have been accused of receiving bribes recently in exchange for favourable contracts.\n\nIn July 2021, court documents showed how a former United Kingdom-based trader for Glencore Plc, Anthony Stimler, conspired with others to make millions of U.S. dollars in corrupt bribe payments to officials in Nigeria.\n\nThe former trader pleaded guilty over what prosecutors in the United States described as his role in a scheme to bribe.\n\nA Bloomberg report said that Stimler admitted to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and commit money laundering at a hearing in Manhattan federal court conducted by video.\n\nProsecutors had said millions of dollars in bribes were paid to officials in Nigeria, in exchange for NNPC awarding oil contracts and providing \u201cmore lucrative grades of oil on more favorable delivery terms.\u201d\n\nProsecutors had alleged that in Nigeria, in exchange for the bribes, officials caused the Nigerian state-owned and state-controlled oil company (NNPC) to award oil contracts and to provide more lucrative grades of oil on more favorable delivery terms to Glencore, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company, and their business partners.",

          "text": "The presidency has accused Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue state, of \u201cusing language reminiscent of the Rwandan genocide\u201d to cause the deaths of Nigerians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe presidency said the governor is trying to boost his \u201csinking political fortunes\u201d by stirring up hatred and targeting one ethnic group.\n\nOrtom had in a recent interview accused President Muhammadu Buhari of trying to \u201cFulanise\u201d the country.\n\nThe governor spoke in the wake of Buhari\u2019s approval of the recommendations of a committee to review 368 grazing reserves across 25 states in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting in a statement on Wednesday, Garba Shehu, senior special assistant to the president, said the governor\u2019s actions are a \u201cstain on the country\u201d.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cGovernor Samuel Ortom has few political principles. We can see this from the fact that he has changed political party five times during his undistinguished career.

This is a copy of the language of Hutu Power \u2013 which falsely, and intentionally, accused the Rwandan Tutsi of plans to dominate the country.\n\n\u201cThis wicked talk is aimed at giving cover to his so-called \u201cpolicy\u201d on the Ranches Establishment Law \u2013 which in reality is purely an act of denial of the law \u2013 intended to withhold rights and freedoms from one ethnic group alone, whilst inciting race hatred against them amongst all others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese are not the actions of a man who should be trusted with running public services or holding public office. For the governor of a major state in Nigeria to be politically driven by ethnic hatred is a stain on our country.\u201d\n\nShehu said the people of Benue \u201cdeserve more than this\u201d, adding that the state will have an \u201copportunity to restore its greatness\u201d during the 2023 elections.",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter.

          "text": "Ethiopia has begun developing its own social media platforms to rival Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Zoom, as per Reuters.\n\nAccording to the state communications security agency on Monday, the government wants its local platform to \u201creplace\u201d existing platforms, although it does not plan to block the other services.\n\nThe director-general of the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), Shumete Gizaw has accused Facebook of deleting posts and user accounts that he said were \u201cdisseminating the true reality about Ethiopia.\u201d\n\nIn June, Facebook pulled down fake accounts targeting opposition figures ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives election, a move that didn\u2019t sit well with the incumbent Ethiopian government. In a local media outlet on Friday, Shumete accused Facebook of blocking users who were \u201cpreaching national unity and peace\u201d.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethiopian government has been criticized for shutting down access to internet and social media services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, due to unrest in the Tigray region and during the election. The government has not commented on those shutdowns.\n\nSince November 2020, Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous country with about 115 million people, has been engulfed in a civil war between the federal government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the Tigray region in the country\u2019s north.\n\nSupporters of the different sides have taken the conversation over to social media.\n\nTo build these platforms, Ethiopia is relying solely on local expertise. While Shumete declined to share further details about its social media rival project, he proudly asserted that Ethiopia won\u2019t be the first to rely on local talents to build its social networks.\n\n\u201cThe rationale behind developing technology with local capacity is clear \u2026 Why do you think China is using WeChat?\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing such a parallel with the social messaging app WeChat is a bit troubling. WeChat, which is owned by China-headquartered Tencent Holdings, is widely used in the country and is considered to be a strong tool by Chinese authorities for monitoring its population.\n\nAffected by the pandemic, the Ethiopian government has a lot on its plate as it works towards economic recovery. It\u2019s looking to raise money via sales of telecom licenses and obtaining an additional $1 billion debt.\n\nThis begs the question of whether investing in state-owned social network platforms should be on its list of priorities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the heels of $40 million Series A in July \u2014 one of the largest fundings in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region \u2014 Egypt-based Business to Business (B2B) eCommerce platform, MaxAB, has announced getting $15 million additional funding in closing its Series A round, and the acquisition of WaystoCap, a YC-backed Morocco-based B2B, eCommerce, and distribution platform.\n\nThe extra funding came from existing investors, RMBV, IFC, Flourish Ventures, Crystal Stream Capital, Rise Capital, Endeavour Catalyst, Beco Capital, and 4DX Ventures.\n\nMaxAB\u2019s acquisition of WaystoCap is in line with its plans to scale across Africa. CEO and Co-founder, Belal El-Megharbel, believes that it is a step in the right direction, owing to their pre-existing relationship with WaystoCap, and the startup\u2019s experience in the region.\n\n\u201cWe are about to take the food and grocery industry to another level in North Africa. The creation of this new super-team, combining a powerhouse of talent, technological know-how, on the ground infrastructure, boosted supply chains, and WaystoCap\u2019s phenomenal experience of the region is very exciting. We have a long-standing and excellent working relationship with WaystoCap and share a common vision to re-engineer the traditional food and grocery market to better serve traditional retailers.\u201d\n\nFounded by Niama El Bassunie, Mehdi Daoui, Anis Abdeddine and Aziz Jaouhari Tissafi in 2017, WaystoCap is the first Moroccan startup to be accepted in Y Combinator. The company initially operated as a platform for cross-border trading activities allowing it to establish a presence in Ivory Coast and Togo.\n\nFollowing incubation in YC\u2019s 2017 Winter batch and an ensuing $3 million seed raise, the founders switched business model and began a B2B eCommerce system connecting retailers with suppliers. In running with this model, they withdrew from the two West African countries to focus on Morocco. Currently, they have a network of 8,000 retailers across the country.\n\nThis acquisition will see MaxAB position itself in Morocco and the Maghreb region, which comprises Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia.\n\nEl Bassunie, who will assume the position of Managing Director, MaxAB Morocco, says she sees the merger as a positive signal for the ecosystem in the MENA region, as it fosters efforts to build solutions that solve the region\u2019s unique challenges.\n\n\u201cMorocco is an exciting and fast-growing market, and with the tremendous increase in government and investor support, the tech ecosystem in Africa and the Middle East is enabling entrepreneurs to build and create novel solutions for some of the key day-to-day challenges faced in the region.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team being created and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply. We are looking forward to continuing our close working relationship with our new team and taking the business to its next phase.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2018, MaxAB is a platform that delivers supplies to stores in Egypt. Store owners can use the platform to purchase goods, arrange for delivery or logistics, and communicate with a customer support team. This additional fund takes MaxAB\u2019s total announced funding to $60 million. The amount for which WaystoCap was acquired was undisclosed.\n\nThere are several positive projections for the eCommerce industry in the MENA region, and news of large fundings and acquisitions support these projections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nChimgozirim here,\n\nWhat we\u2019re discussing today:\n\nEthiopia takes on Facebook, others\n\nFacebook launches Marketplace in 37 African countries\n\nEcoCash users to pay more\n\nChari.ma acquires Karny.ma\n\nEthiopia to build local alternatives to Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media apps\n\nThe Ethiopian government plans to build local alternatives to Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and the video conferencing platform, Zoom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince last year, Ethiopia has been involved in an armed conflict between the government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF). The conflict has seen supporters of both sides take to social media to show support and push each party\u2019s agenda.\n\nShumete Gizaw, Director-General of the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), has accused Facebook of deleting accounts and posts that were \u201cdisseminating the true reality of Ethiopia.\u201d\n\nReferencing China, Gizaw asked rhetorically, \u201cWhy do you think China uses WeChat?\u201d This reference to WeChat is troubling as the platform is widely considered a tool for monitoring the Chinese people and could indicate the real purpose of these plans.\n\nHe also disclosed that the country would use local talents to build these platforms.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethiopian government has shut down access to Internet services, drawing the ire of local and international observers.\n\nSuggested read: Sub-Saharan Africa lost $237.4 million to Internet censorship in 2020\n\nEthiopia\u2019s desire to build local alternatives to existing social media platforms is not surprising. As more Africans have begun acquiring smartphones, social media has become an outlet for them to speak out against political authorities, with several governments moving to limit or stop the use of these platforms.\n\nCountries like Uganda and Nigeria have had various forms of social media-regulating bills floated. Ethiopia\u2019s move to build its local platforms is, however, a bold move and seems like a desperate action by the government to control information in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook Marketplace launches in 37 African countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood news: Yesterday, Facebook announced the launch of Facebook Marketplace in 37 sub-Saharan African countries and territories, including Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Eswatini, Equatorial Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nUntil now, Facebook Marketplace was only available in four African countries \u2014 South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.\n\nKojo Boakye, Facebook\u2019s Director of Public Policy, Africa, commenting on the launch, said, \u201cIncreasing the availability of Marketplace to 37 more countries and territories in sub-Saharan Africa reinforces our ongoing commitment to helping connect communities and support buying and selling through one simple online destination.\u201d\n\nFacebook Marketplace marked the social media giant\u2019s entrance into the eCommerce space as it allows Facebook users to buy and sell items in their immediate community. In its early days, some users exploited the platform to sell drugs and guns, leading Facebook to add filters to increase security.\n\nMore charges for EcoCash users\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers of EcoCash, Zimbabwe\u2019s largest mobile money platform, will pay more in transaction fees from Sunday, September 19, 2021, after the company received approval from regulatory bodies.\n\nAfter its last review of transaction charges in January 2021, users will pay about 10% more when making transactions. Per The Herald, EcoCash subscribers will pay $9.38 when sending $100 to a registered user, up from the previous charge of $8.01.\n\nAlso, consumers buying Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) electricity tokens will pay $9, up from $7.76, while those buying goods valued at $100 will pay $8.91, up from the previous charge of $7.71. However, charges on transactions above $3,000 will not increase with users continuing to pay charges of 1.91% for sending money and 1.85% for making bill and merchant payments.\n\nChari.ma acquires Karny.ma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChari.ma Co-Founders, Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat\n\nMoroccan eCommerce startup, Chari.ma has announced the acquisition of mobile credit book application, Karny.ma for an undisclosed amount.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari is an eCommerce platform for traditional retailers that allows them to order and receive goods within a day.\n\nIn July, it became the first Moroccan startup to get into Y Combinator and raised money from Orange Ventures and Plug and Play.\n\nKarny.ma is a phone-based credit book app that allows traditional convenience stores to manage loans given to their customers. Using an app that is available on the Google Play Store, retailers can record loans which they can then share with their debtors, making it easier to collect the loans. Already, the startup claims to have onboarded 15,000 active stores across Morocco.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the acquisition, Belkhayat said, \u201cKarny.ma users are the right target for Chari. We believe there can be many synergies between the two apps, and we want to grow both in parallel with the end goal of starting to offer financial services to all of our customers.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWatch How China Handles Afghanistan.

We can see this from the fact that he has changed political party five times during his undistinguished career,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cEvery time he feels the wind may be blowing in a certain direction, he follows it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, for the good citizens of Benue State, the most dangerous direction he blows in today is that of sectarianism and ethnicity.\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to boost his sinking political fortunes, Ortom takes the cheapest and lowest route possible by playing on ethnic themes and in doing so knowingly causes deaths of innocent Nigerians by inciting farmers against herders, and Christians against Muslims.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Ortom stirs up hatred by targeting one single ethnic group in Nigeria \u2013 using language reminiscent of the Rwandan genocide.\n\n\u201cAs was the case in Rwanda where the then Hutu leaders of the country incited their countrymen against each other, claiming there was a \u201csecret Tutsi agenda\u201d over the Hutu, Ortom claims there is a \u201csecret Fulanization agenda\u201d over other ethnic groups in his state and in Nigeria. This is a copy of the language of Hutu Power \u2013 which falsely, and intentionally, accused the Rwandan Tutsi of plans to dominate the country.\n\n\u201cThis wicked talk is aimed at giving cover to his so called \u201cpolicy\u201d on the Ranches Establishment Law \u2013 which in reality is purely an act of denial of the law \u2013 intended to withhold rights and freedoms from one ethnic group alone, whilst inciting race hatred against them amongst all others\n\n\u201cThese are not the actions of a man who should be trusted with running public services or holding public office. For the governor of a major state in Nigeria to be politically driven by ethnic hatred is a stain on our country.\n\n\u201cThe good, and fair-minded people of Benue State deserve more than this, and we look forward to the next elections when they have an opportunity to restore its greatness.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong has re-imposed a 24-hour curfew in Jos North Local Government Area of the state following killing of at least 36 persons in an overnight raid on Tuesday by suspected herders.\n\nThe 24-hour curfew earlier imposed in the council area was relaxed last week to dusk-to-dawn alongside two other LGAs of Jos South and Bassa.\n\nBut a statement on Wednesday by the Governor\u2019s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Government House, Macham Makut, said the decision to reimpose the curfew which will begin by 4pm on Wednesday followed imminent threat to lives and properties in the council area.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPlateau State Government has reinstated the 24-hour curfew earlier relaxed in Jos North Local Government Area following growing tensions arising from the attack on Yelwa Zangam village of the Local Government where people were killed and properties destroyed.\n\n\u201cAccording to Governor Simon Lalong, the 24 hour will come into force from 4pm, today Wednesday 25th August 2021 until further notice.\n\n\u201cThe proactive decision became necessary following eminent threat to lives and properties within the Local Government Area and the need to forestall the breakdown of law and order. It will also enable security agencies deploy appropriately to maintain security as the search for the attackers of the villagers continues.\u201d\n\nLalong appealed to the citizens of Jos North to cooperate with the Government by abiding to the 24-hour curfew, saying security agencies have been mandated to ensure that those who violate the curfew are arrested.\n\n\u201cAlso, the 6pm to 6am curfew in Jos South and Bassa LGAs still remains in place until further notice. Only people on essential duties such as health personnel, journalists, fire service and para-military and others, are to be exempted from the curfew but should carry means of identification with them at all times,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is calling for calm as he is seriously grieved by the attacks. He again sympathises with the victims, but wants them to show restraint and allow Government to handle the matter to disallow hoodlums from taking advantage of the unfortunate situation to cause mayhem and destruction in the State.\u201d",

We sincerely hope that as we go along in our relationship, we will collaborate to ensure that we reduce this incident of kidnapping to absolute zero\u201d, the governor said.\n\nWhile describing insecurity as an act of sabotage, he said Ogun has been proactive in the area of security by rejigging the State Security Trust Fund, which according to him, had helped in providing patrol vans, communication and other gadgets to enable security agencies carry out their functions effectively.\n\nAbiodun, however, thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the use of a Nigeria Police helicopter that has been working and providing air surveillance in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe use of that helicopter greatly assisted us in reducing the response time to kidnap situation and consequently reduced kidnap situations. I understand that the helicopter has been re-assisgned for use somewhere else, it is my hope that AIG, you will use your good office to ensure that the helicopter is redeployed back to Ogun State.\n\n\u201cYou will note that Ogun has an unusual amount of federal roads compared to other states. We have the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Epe-Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu-Ikorodu and the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta road, all these are federal roads. We find out that 80 to 90% of the stretch of these roads are in Ogun State and it is humanly impossible for the men of the Nigeria Police to patrol all those roads as adequately as they require\n\n\u201cBut each time we have a distress call on any of those locations, either from Yewa, meaning Imeko, Ipokia all the way to Ogun Waterside or Ijebu-Igbo, the helicopter was able to respond swiftly to the distress calls while your men now move in, thereby ensuring that the kidnappers are not able to leave the immediate corridor before the men arrive. I want to use this opportunity to implore that you help us to discuss with your men of the Air Wing to ensure the speedy return of this helicopter\u201d.\n\nSpeaking earlier, AIG Kokumo said Zone 2 comprising Ogun and Lagos States police commands was planning a joint operation between the two commands to fight criminals, particularly at Kara and Under the Bridge along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.\n\nThis, according to him, is to ensure that adequate security is provided for companies, industries and individuals operating along the axis.\n\nThe AIG who hinted that he was in the state on a familiarisation visit, noted that the Zone was working on a synergy between the Marine Olive Units of Lagos and Ogun State command to provide security in the coastal areas.\n\nKokumo also appreciated the Abiodun-led administration in the state for providing the necessary working tools to the police force, noting \u201cwithout the commitment of the governor, policing the state would have been difficult\u201d.",

I understand that the helicopter has been re-assisgned for use somewhere else, it is my hope that AIG, you will use your good office to ensure that the helicopter is redeployed back to Ogun State.\n\n\u201cYou will note that Ogun has an unusual amount of federal roads compared to other states. We have the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Epe-Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu-Ikorodu and the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta road, all these are federal roads. We find out that 80 to 90% of the stretch of these roads are in Ogun State and it is humanly impossible for the men of the Nigeria Police to patrol all those roads as adequately as they require\n\n\u201cBut each time we have a distress call on any of those locations, either from Yewa, meaning Imeko, Ipokia all the way to Ogun Waterside or Ijebu-Igbo, the helicopter was able to respond swiftly to the distress calls while your men now move in, thereby ensuring that the kidnappers are not able to leave the immediate corridor before the men arrive. I want to use this opportunity to implore that you help us to discuss with your men of the Air Wing to ensure the speedy return of this helicopter\u201d.\n\nSpeaking earlier, AIG Kokumo said Zone 2 comprising Ogun and Lagos States police commands was planning a joint operation between the two commands to fight criminals, particularly at Kara and Under the Bridge along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.\n\nThis, according to him, is to ensure that adequate security is provided for companies, industries and individuals operating along the axis.\n\nThe AIG who hinted that he was in the state on a familiarisation visit, noted that the Zone was working on a synergy between the Marine Olive Units of Lagos and Ogun State command to provide security in the coastal areas.\n\nKokumo also appreciated the Abiodun-led administration in the state for providing the necessary working tools to the police force, noting \u201cwithout the commitment of the governor, policing the state would have been difficult\u201d.",

          "text": "Former Nigerian Navy Commodore Kunle Olawunmi has questioned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to investigate high-profile politicians revealed as sponsors by Boko Haram terrorists during interrogation.\n\nOlawunmi made his speech on Channels Television\u2019s \u201cSunrise Daily\u201d breakfast show on Wednesday.\n\nHe decried the attack on the Kaduna campus of Nigeria\u2019s top military academy, the Nigerian Defence Academy, by ruthless bandits on Tuesday, in which two military officers were killed and another kidnapped.\n\n\u201cIt is an abnormality; you don\u2019t attack the Nigerian Defence Academy and get away with it,\u201d stated the Professor of Global Security Studies.\n\nHe did explain, however, that the NDA, like other military bases in the country, opens its doors to the public for Jumat prayer on Fridays.\n\nDuring Friday Muslim prayers, terrorists and criminals, according to Olawunmi, profile military situations.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn 2017, I carried out an investigation by the Minister of Defence that wanted me to check what was going on with the training and the security there (NDA). I remember I spent about a week in the NDA with the commandant and the staff but something struck me: every Friday, the gate of NDA is thrown open and everybody has access to pray in the mosque.\n\n\u201cOn Fridays, you are going to see the same thing happening across all military formations in the country. If you go to Defence Headquarters, I served at the Defence Headquarters as the Deputy Director, Defence Administration, between 2015 and 2017, throughout my two years at Defence Headquarters, I received visitors twice because of the strict security architecture there but every Friday, the gate of the Defence Headquarters is thrown wide open for everybody to come in and observe Juma\u2019at.\n\n\u201cThat is the time the terrorists have the time to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I have served the military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religion and socio-cultural.\u201d\n\nOlawunmi added that he was a member of the Intelligence Brief at the Defence Headquarters during the leadership of the then Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.).\n\nThe intelligence expert said he told the then CDS that the centre of gravity of the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the North-East and spreading to other parts of Nigeria was the sponsor.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin then that the centre of this problem cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta problem was solved during (Ex-President Umaru) Yar\u2019adua basically by me and I told them that we can\u2019t use that same template for Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin to look at the centre of gravity of the problem. I was made a member of the committee in 2016-2017 including former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru that died.\n\n\u201cI told them that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram in Nigeria is the sponsors of the programme. It was beyond us because the job we needed to do was kinetic but we cannot resolve the issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government that we know them. That was why we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved the issue because we need to arrest people.\n\n\u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram, why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them? Why can\u2019t this government bring them to trial if not that they are partisan and part of the charade that is going on?\n\n\u201cYou remember this Boko Haram issue started in 2012 and I was in the military intelligence at that time. We arrested those people. My organisation conducted interrogation and they (suspects) mentioned names. I can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now, some of them are in the Senate, some of them are in Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cWhy should a government decide to cause this kind of embarrassment and insecurity to the sense of what happened yesterday (Tuesday at the NDA)?\u201d\n\nOlawunmi also said that the Department of State Services had tremendous information on terrorists but they could not do anything except by the body language of the Commander-In-Chief.",

          "text": "Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari has projected $57 per barrel as crude oil bench mark for 2022.\n\nMallam Kyari, in his presentation to the National Assembly provided a base oil price scenario in the medium term as follows $57 per barrel for 2022, $61 per barrel for 2023 and $62 per barrel for 2024.\n\nKyari said the assumptions were arrived at after a careful appraisal of the three-year historical dated Brent Oil Price average of $59.07 per barrel premised on Platts Spot Prices. He said \u201cPrice growth is to be moderated by the lingering concerns over COVID-19, increased energy efficiency, switching due to increased utilisation of gas and alternatives for electricity generation. These are reflected in the Medium Term Revenue Framework\u2019\u2019 Kyari informed.\n\nOn the perennial issue of smuggling of petroleum products, Kyari implored the National Assembly to come to the aid of the Corporation in battling the menace, noting that the Corporation, based on the directive of Mr. President, had mobilised some Federal Agencies like the Customs, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Police, Civil Defence Corps and others, to find workable solutions to the menace. Kyari on Wednesday received accolades from the House of Representatives Committee on Finance for providing detailed explanations on some burning Oil Industry issues at an interactive session on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure and Revenue Framework (MTERF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP).\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Finance, Hon. Abiodun James Faleke, commended the NNPC GMD for providing an in-depth explanation and insider perspective on some issues surrounding the operations of the NNPC and the Oil Industry stating: \u201cYou have made our day, the committee is better informed based on explanations provided by the GMD.\u201d\n\nOn the propriety of establishing NNPC Retail stations in neighbouring countries to curb the challenge of illegal haulage of petroleum products across the border, Kyari said though the NNPC once considered the option, it had to jettison the idea when it became imperative that the measure would be counterproductive.\n\nHe said that people who are smuggling are not looking for officially priced petroleum products.\n\nHe further noted that going ahead to establish NNPC Retail stations would not yield the desired result since the people who take products across the border are not interested in selling at the official prevailing prices at approved stations but are interested in under the counter deals. The NNPC GMD also took time to provide detailed explanation on the Corporation\u2019s equity shareholding interest in Dangote Refinery, noting that the package which was at the instance of NNPC is designed to guarantee national energy security.\n\nHe stated that the equity interest was secured after due consideration of the national interest and best possible options. \u201cWe will have right to 20 percent of production from this facility. We structured our equity participation on the basis that the refinery must buy at least 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day of our production. This guarantees our market at a period when every country is struggling to find market for their crude oil\u2019\u2019 he explained.",

If truly the claims in the said report emanated from the lawmaker, then we must state without mincing words that they are not only unfounded but a travesty of facts and reality. The claim is completely devoid of truth. It is most unfair for anyone at that height of the social ladder to sponsor a smear campaign against the Nigerian Army for whatever reason; particularly knowing that he has access to the leadership of the military.\n\n\u201cContrary to the narrative being peddled in the said report, it took the gallantry of our men on patrol to rescue the victims of the said kidnap incident before handing them over to the police. How then could the same Army that was instrumental to the rescue of the victims, turn around to order the release of the suspects. Evidently, this is illogical and a blatant lie.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army, therefore, wishes to state that the misguided report is actually an abysmally failed attempt at blackmailing the NA for denying unscrupulous elements the freedom of action to foist lawlessness and violence on the good people and government of Abia state.\n\n\u201cThe honorable lawmaker should have abinitio, sought clarifications from the Army before resorting to media trial. We, therefore, appeal to members of the public to approach the Army on any issue requiring clarification rather than resorting to blackmail\u201d.",

Within these years Buhari has in addition to giving several Benue people appointments, constructed a multi-billion erosion control that runs through Achusa, PMB has awarded the Yandev \u2013 Makurdi Road, the Yandev to Ugbema junction road, the makurdi \u2013 Naka \u2013 Adoka road, the rehabilitation of The River Benue and River Katsina-Ala Bridges.\n\n\u201cMr President has upgraded the Zaki Biam Yam market in Ukum LGA to an international yam market.

But we leave the resolution of the same in the hands of the Almighty God.\n\n\u201cWhereas, while Captain Idahosa Wells Okunbo was physically here with us, he had mooted the idea of selling some of his assets which, truth be told, he had inalienable rights to do in order to clear his table before his glorious transition; we are not privy to any conclusion on the sale of the said hotel nor his final wish on the hotel in his WILL.\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say, therefore, that the wicked story is nothing but an unfortunate figment of the evil imagination of some depraved persons, acting in tandem with the writers of the story.\n\n\u201cThe Okunbo family stands united in ensuring the consolidation of the laudable legacy our departed dearly beloved son, brother, father, grandfather, and highly celebrated global citizen left behind. We will leave no stone unturned to celebrate this generational gift to humanity and this he eminently deserves.\n\n\u201cLikewise, we also wish to note the video by agents of Satan, which we had earlier ignored, highlighting his so-called \u201cpalatial and state-of-the-art piece of residential architecture\u201d on Banana Island, Lagos , which development has been ongoing for a few years now. This, again, is another wicked misinformation from demoniacs who will be judged appropriately by our Almighty Father in heaven.\n\n\u201cThe family remains resolute and committed to honouring our great son of universal accomplishments. We are unyielding on this commitment and nothing will distract this family, under any circumstance(s), before, during, and after the burial obsequies. Our unity remains indissoluble and we remain more united henceforth to the glory of God.\n\n\u201cWe hereby state, very unequivocally, that the media organizations which propagated this falsehood, are herewith given 14 days to retract this malicious and false publication; otherwise, we shall be left with no other alternative than to take necessary legal steps to further protect the integrity and dignity of our family.\n\n\u201cFinally, we appeal to members of the public to allow our family to grieve privately the loss of our precious gem and refrain from deliberate attempts to draw us out into the public arena.\u201d",

          "title": "Insecurity: Matawalle Calls For State Of Emergency In Northern Nigeria",
          "text": "Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, has called for a state of emergency in the northern part of the country over the security challenges in the region.\n\nHe made the call on Wednesday at a meeting with the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 10, Ali Janga, at the Government House in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nThe governor who is seriously concerned about the series of attacks in many states in the region believes a declaration of a state of emergency will address the problem of insecurity in the North.\n\nNigeria\u2019s northern region comprises three geopolitical zones \u2013 North East, North West, and North-Central \u2013 and 19 states, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nOver the years, parts of the region have been grappling with a series of criminal activities such as kidnapping, bombings, and attacks on communities as a result of insurgency and banditry.\n\nBefore now, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the region while millions were forced to flee their ancestral homes.\n\nBoko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) are largely responsible for the incidents in the North East, while bandits have continued to engage in kidnapping for ransom in the North West and parts of the North Central.\n\nSchools and security formations have been targets for the criminals, and the latest is the attack on the Nigeria Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna State.\n\nFor some persons of concern, including Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, there is a strong connection between the terrorists and the bandits.\n\nFollowing the meeting with the senior police officer on Wednesday, Governor Matawalle briefed the people of the state on the present security situation in Zamfara.\n\nRead the full text of the briefing below:\n\nMy dear people of Zamfara State.\n\nFollowing the recent upsurge in banditry attacks in some parts of our dear State, I feel compelled to address you on the new steps being taken by my administration to contain the situation.\n\nAs we all know, the primary objective of the state is to provide security for the lives of the people and their property. My primary motivation for running for the office of governor in 2019 is to devote myself to addressing the enormous and protracted security challenges faced by our dear state for over a decade.\n\nI wish to express my profound sympathies to all those who have lost their loved ones, property, and those who have been displaced and separated from their family. My heart goes to the women and children who have been forced to live in deplorable conditions of being widows, orphans and displaced as a result of the bandits\u2019 constant onslaught.\n\nOne can only imagine the constant state of misery and sleeplessness that our people are frequently experiencing. We must remain resolute in our efforts to contain this situation.\n\nEven though we were all aware of the bleak situation of Zamfara State before I took over as Governor in May 2019, it would not be inappropriate for me to take a trip down memory lane to remind us of it.\n\nMany parts of the state were literally governed by the bandits, who were having a field day in virtually all the rural areas of the state. Villages were being raided in the most inhumane manner possible-massacres carried out, and those who survived the attacks were subjected to all forms of indignities, including rape and torture.\n\nVirtually all markets were closed as traders could not risk their lives to attend the markets. There was a general sense of despondency everywhere, as the entire rural economy, which is largely agrarian, had collapsed, posing the threat of starvation. The rural Zamfara was a huge centre of humanitarian catastrophe with people left to their own devices.\n\nFrom day one, my administration took a close look at the situation and weighed the choices. Following extensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders, including traditional and religious leaders and security services, it was overwhelmingly agreed that the best way to address such a huge security challenge, which has the appearance of ethnic and inter-communal disharmony, is through dialogue and reconciliation with feuding parties. For example:\n\nWe have seen a remarkable precedent in the act of Prophet Muhammad, may the peace of Allah be upon him, where he brokered peace with Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj through the process of dialogue and reconciliation.\n\nIn our contemporary time, we have seen how the dialogue mechanism was used to end the Nigerian civil war, which raged between 1967 and 1970; the Lebanese civil war of 1975 to 1990; we have seen how peace mechanism worked between Tivs and Jukun and many other conflicts that are directly or indirectly linked to ethnicity in Nigeria.\n\nIt is evident from our experience in history that social eruptions and conflicts that border on ethnic or religious fault lines are better addressed through the instrument of dialogue instead of military or police action. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to such issues. In reality, experience has shown that they are better addressed via dialogue and reconciliation, as violence frequently leads to further violence.\n\nAs a fallout of our dialogue and reconciliation policy, hostilities between the bandits and Yansakai were immediately ceased. The state witnessed about nine months of peace; hundreds of kidnapped people were unconditionally released by their captives; hundreds of assorted arms and ammunition were surrendered by both the bandits and the Yansakai.\n\nThe state witnessed the rebirth of the glorious era of brotherhood, love and mutual coexistence between members of the Fulani ethnic group and the Hausas. For the first time, in more than a decade, the annual Sharu festival was held in Gusau in 2019.\n\nThe amazing successes of our peace efforts made our initiative appealing to some of the states sharing similar experiences as our state. Some of them opted for dialogue but eventually abandoned the programme after running into some issues.\n\nHowever, things took a dramatic turn, with the issue given political colouration by a section of politicians. Some people saw our progress as a threat to their political survival and began making disparaging efforts to undermine our achievements. Those acts of sabotage were the beginning of the ugly turn of events.\n\nThe primary hurdles to our peace efforts, based on my experience over the last two years, are:\n\nReluctance on the part of the affected states to engage in peace talks, which would have denied the recalcitrant bandits who are currently making life difficult for our people a safe passage through the region; lack of support from a section of politicians and conflict entrepreneurs that wish to take advantage of the situation to achieve political ends; and the need for the Federal Government to key into the peace initiative so that appropriate resources can be allocated to make it more comprehensive.\n\nMy good people of Zamfara state, you are living witnesses to all our unwavering commitments to peace. I have had cause to meet with Mr President on matters relating to the state\u2019s security on several occasions.\n\nI met the national security chiefs on numerous occasions. I have extended an olive branch to our political opponents in view of my conviction that attaining a lasting peace will require unity among all segments of society. Almost all my engagements outside the state are related to issues of security.\n\nIn taking my recent decision to move to the APC, my aim is to have an all-inclusive government where people with different political perspectives will put their hands together for the development of our dear state. I reached out to the notable political figures in the State and made known to them my desire to have a united front to confront and address the numerous issues of development affecting our state.\n\nI have made several political offers to the opposition because I have no mission far crucial than that of securing our state. This I have done despite vehement objection by my political associates. My belief has always been no amount of sacrifice is too much for peace.\n\nThis is why I took myself to the doorsteps of some political stakeholders with the aim of uniting ourselves to form a formidable team to address the disturbing security challenge bedevilling our dear State in the spirit of forging unity for the benefit of our dear state.\n\nApart from our peace and reconciliation efforts and the recent political developments, we have equally maintained our obligations to our security forces through the provision of logistical and all other supports they require to discharge their function.\n\nWe had an expanded Security Council meeting last Monday in furtherance of our steadfast efforts to confront this persistent challenge. The meeting was attended by all security chiefs, emirs, and the ulamas. I commend all of them for positively and sincerely offering their advice on how best to tackle the problems at hand.\n\nWe reviewed the effectiveness or otherwise of the current security measures aimed at containing the security challenge and received reports from members. Some of the observations and resolutions of the meeting that we can share with the public are:\n\nThe security agencies have given their assurances to the general public of commitment to protecting lives and property across the State, as well as their readiness for rapid and prompt response to distress calls;\n\nThe general public should therefore continue to cooperate and support the security forces to achieve the desired objective. We should appreciate the monumental sacrifices by our security agents and encourage them to work harder;\n\nSecurity is everyone\u2019s responsibility, People should, therefore, be vigilant and report any suspicious character to the appropriate authorities;\n\nIslamic scholars are called upon to intensify sermons and preaching on issues bordering on security, sanctity and inviolability of human life;\n\nThe conventional and new media practitioners should play a positive role in promoting peace and harmony and desist from disseminating unconfirmed and inciting reports that may jeopardise public security;\n\nPoliticians should join ranks and work in unison towards combatting the security challenge;\n\nApart from the measures outlined, the meeting has also agreed to take further tactical measures to effectively contain the challenging situation across the State.\n\nMy dear people of Zamfara State, I would like to use this opportunity to call on all of us to remain fervently prayerful for peace to reign in our State and the nation in general. We should ask Allah for forgiveness and His divine intervention.\n\nOnce again, I wish to extend my deep sympathy to those who sustained various degrees of injuries those recuperating in hospitals and at home. I wish them speedy recovery and good health. Government will continue to give them all medical and other necessary support.\n\nI reassure you that we are doing everything humanly possible to address this lingering challenge.\n\nI thank you all.\n\nWassalamu Alaikum",

We can see this from the fact that he has changed political party five times during his undistinguished career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery time he feels the wind may be blowing in a certain direction, he follows it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, for the good citizens of Benue State, the most dangerous direction he blows in today is that of sectarianism and ethnicity.\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to boost his sinking political fortunes, Ortom takes the cheapest and lowest route possible by playing on ethnic themes \u2013 and in doing so knowingly causes deaths of innocent Nigerians by inciting farmers against herders, and Christians against Muslims.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Ortom stirs up hatred by targeting one single ethnic group in Nigeria \u2013 using language reminiscent of the Rwandan genocide.\n\n\u201cAs was the case in Rwanda where the then Hutu leaders of the country incited their countrymen against each other, claiming there was a \u2018secret Tutsi agenda\u2019 over the Hutu, Ortom claims there is a \u2018secret Fulanization agenda\u2019 over other ethnic groups in his state and in Nigeria. This is a copy of the language of Hutu Power \u2013 which falsely, and intentionally, accused the Rwandan Tutsi of plans to dominate the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis wicked talk is aimed at giving cover to his so-called \u2018policy\u2019 on the Ranches Establishment Law \u2013 which in reality is purely an act of denial of the law \u2013 intended to withhold rights and freedoms from one ethnic group alone, whilst inciting race hatred against them amongst all others.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency said the Governor is not fit for public office, expressing the hope that the people of the state would make a better choice in the next election.\n\n\u201cThese are not the actions of a man who should be trusted with running public services or holding public office.\n\n\u201cFor the governor of a major state in Nigeria to be politically driven by ethnic hatred is a stain on our country.\n\n\u201cThe good, and fair-minded people of Benue State deserve more than this, and we look forward to the next elections when they have an opportunity to restore its greatness,\u201d the statement reads.",

The government has not commented on those shutdowns.\n\nFacebook is yet to comment on Ethiopia\u2019s plans and has not also responded to Shumete\u2019s accusations.\n\nEthiopia, a country of about 115 million, has about 6 million Facebook users according to Statista.\n\nBut in June, days before national elections, Facebook said it had removed a network of fake accounts in Ethiopia targeting domestic users. Facebook linked these accounts to individuals associated with INSA, which is responsible for monitoring telecommunications and the internet.\n\nTwitter and Zoom are also yet to comment on the development.\n\nShumete declined to specify a timeline, budget and other details, but told Reuters: \u201cThe rationale behind developing technology with local capacity is clear \u2026 Why do you think China is using WeChat?\u201d\n\nHe said Ethiopia had the local expertise to develop the platforms and would not hire outsiders to help.\n\nSocial messaging app WeChat is owned by China-headquartered Tencent Holdings. It is widely used in the country, and is considered to be a strong tool by Chinese authorities for monitoring its population.\n\nShumete also referred Reuters to comments he made on Friday to a local language media outlet in which he accused Facebook of blocking users who were \u201cpreaching national unity and peace\u201d.\n\nHe also told Al-Ain Amharic that authorities were working on the platform to replace Facebook and Twitter, while a trial has already been completed of a platform to replace WhatsApp and Zoom and that platform will soon be operational.",

          "text": "Delta Air Lines on Wednesday said employees will have to pay $200 more every month for their company-sponsored healthcare plan if they choose to not vaccinate against COVID-19.\n\nThe move to add a surcharge to health insurance contributions is the latest tactic by corporate America to push employees to get the shots to fight the pandemic.\n\nA number of U.S. companies, including Delta competitor United Airlines, have mandated shots for their employees to protect their operations from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has hit parts of the country with lower vaccination levels.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also urged private businesses to require employees to be vaccinated.\n\nIn a staff memo, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the monthly surcharge would take effect on Nov. 1.\n\nBastian said the surcharge is necessary to address the financial risk the Atlanta-based airline faces from the decision to not vaccinate.\n\nA Delta Air spokesperson said the average hospital stay for COVID-19 has cost the company $40,000 per person. The surcharge would apply to the entire workforce and a proof or documentation of vaccination will be needed to avoid it, the spokesperson said.\n\nChris Riggins, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Delta, said the union does not intend to oppose the proposed surcharge because it would not affect the healthcare plan it has negotiated with the airline for its members.\n\nBut since most of the pilots are not covered by the union-negotiated plan, Riggins said they would see an increase in their healthcare costs if they decide to remain unvaccinated.\n\nIn the memo, Bastian said 75% of Delta Air\u2019s workforce has been vaccinated. However, all the employees who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated, he said.\n\nWhile Delta had refrained from making the shots mandatory for its staff, its latest move was in sharp contrast to the policy being pursued by rivals such as American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are \u201cstrongly encouraging\u201d their employees to get vaccinated.\n\nAmerican Airlines is offering vaccinated employees an additional day off in 2022 and $50 through its employee recognition platform.\n\nBastian said unvaccinated Delta employees will be required to wear masks in all indoor settings, effective immediately.\n\nAny employee in the United States who is not fully vaccinated will be required to take a COVID-19 test every week. The mandatory testing will start on Sept. 12.\n\nThe company will offer COVID-19 pay protection starting Sept. 30 only to fully vaccinated employees who are experiencing a breakthrough infection, he said.\n\nReuters",
