Ltd, Otunba Ademola Akin-Benson alleged that the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladelusi Aladetoyinbo sponsored the attack.\n\nAkin-Benson alleged that the Monarch has been making unlawful moves to grab the land from him and halt the Federal Government project.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOba Aladetoyinbo has been using thugs to disrupt work on site and sometimes drop charms to scare him and the workers.\n\nHe lamented that over N50m had been lost to the perennial attacks by thugs adding that thugs have persistently placed fetish objects on the project site and chased workers away.\n\nAkin-Benson said that the spot where the Deji lays claim to as community land was a distance away and not the spot where work is going on in line with extant court judgment.\n\n\u201cSeveral time Deji has come here to beat people; two weeks ago he sent his boys to kidnap some of our workers here. We reported it to the police and appropriate authorities.\n\n\u201d They were here on the 18th of this month with two bikes, beating and harassing the workers; destroying many building materials as well.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the land belongs to the Federal Government but was ceded to Medaville Building & Construction Co. Ltd to develop.\n\nThe Chairman noted that the matter had been reported to police severally, adding that \u201cwe are in court. My lawyers have filed Section 49 against him which he always run away.\n\n\u201d He has been served but trying to dodge it; it is always like this. We will not take any law into our hands. We will continue to pursue the case to the highest level.\u201d\n\nAkin-Benson, who disclosed that two different litigations have been instituted to check the monarch\u2019s excesses, said he would not allow his to continue to disrupt the Federal Government project.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this in order to ease housing problems in Ondo State. What they did this morning was a disturbance of the peace of the community. The Federal Government is aware of the frequent harassment and destruction.\n\nContacted, the Deji of Akureland,Oba Aladelusi speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Michael Adeyeye described the allegation as unfounded.\n\nOba Aladelusi said \u201d It was Otunba Benson that went to hire thugs and his refusal to pay them their fee led to crisis and destruction witnessed at the site.\n\n\u201cHe is only trying to point accusing fingers rather blame himself for the woes he brought upon himself.\n\n\u201cLike you may be aware, there is a disputed five hectares of land which belongs to Akure, the court had asked him not to work on the disputed area but only on the approved 15 hectares. So we expect him to abide by the decision of the Court over the matter.\n\n\u201cSo, the palace have no hand in the in-fight that ensued between the thugs he engaged on the land.\n\n\u201cAkure will never do anything that will disrupt it\u2019s peace. We want development and expansion, we will not do anything to the contrary.\n\nThe monarch added that \u201d The man in question should check himself and desist from this cheap blackmail.

          "text": "By Ezra Ukanwa\n\nABUJA\u2014AHEAD of the 2023 Presidential elections, a group, Concerned Yoruba Muslim Scholars In Nigeria, CYMSN, on Tuesday, insisted that a Yoruba Muslim must emerge as President or Vice President of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking during a press conference in Abuja, the Acting President General, CYMSN, Sheikh AbduRasheed Mayaleke, stated that the Yoruba Muslims have overtime been relegated to the background when it comes to the issues of the presidency.\n\nMayaleke, however, warned that serious consequences may loom should the political parties present any Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate short of a Yoruba Muslim.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Concerned Yoruba Muslim Scholars in Nigeria has noted with deep concern the unfolding scenarios with respect to the election of candidates by political parties ahead of the 2023 General elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have been watching keenly the process and political parties preparation and wishes to express our great concern for looming crisis if not averted.\n\n\u201cThe present situation where presidential candidates were chosen alternately from the North and Southern part of the country was premised on understanding of the stakeholders to salvage the country as a united nation. We are of the strong opinion that no individual personal interests should be allowed to disrupt this arrangement which is capable of heating up the polity and return the nation to another round of anarchy in the political domain.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the assumption and attempt to permanently disenfranchise the Southern Muslims the opportunity to aspire for highest position of president or vice president of the country is undemocratic, injurious and will be resisted with all legal means available.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer news that the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, has chosen a Northerner as its Presidential flag-bearer, even against the expectation that the candidate would come from the south based on the power rotation convention adopted.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we urge the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, to choose a southerner, and this time around, a Muslim, as its presidential candidate moreso that there is underlying agreement at the inception of party\u2019s formation in 2014. The Qur\u2019an 17:34 says \u201d ..And fulfill the covenant, for you will be called to account regarding the covenant\u201d\n\n\u201cMuslims in Yoruba land have long been relegated to the background over the years when it comes to the issue of the presidency. This time around, it will no longer be business as usual and if the party makes the mistake of denying us the opportunity of having a Muslim President through vicious power game plan, we will not take it.\n\n\u201cIt should be recalled that Christian \u2013 Christian ticket ruled the South west in the first republic with Chief Awolowo as Premier while Chief Akintola was his Vice despite Muslims being the majority. Also, when Gen. Gowon became the head of state, he chose Awolowo as De facto deputy.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that each time a Muslim candidate is poised to emerge as president or vice that the polity is always unnecessarily heated up to favor Christians in the Southwest, this is the fate that befell Late Chief M.K.O Abiola to favor Chief Ernest Shonekan and Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo and Asiwaju Tinubu to favor Prof Osinbajo in 2015.\n\n\u201cIn the Southwest states till date, Christian \u2013 Christian ticket is a common phenomenon without much cry from the Muslim Ummah, why the fuss from our Christian counterparts as regards the faith of Muslim gladiators. For example, Chief Bola Ige had Chief S. M. Afolabi as Governors and deputy in Oyo State in the second republic, Chief Oyinlola paired up with Erelu Obada in the fourth republic as governor and deputy in Osun State and repeatedly in Ondo and Ekiti States.\n\n\u201cwe want to restate that anything short of Muslim candidate from South west for the position of president come 2023 shall be roundly rejected by us and it portends grave danger to the unity of the nation.\u201d",

This was witnessed by the agents of other aspirants, who all participated in the primary.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore worrisome, that days after the election, some desperate politicians, are now hiding under a faceless group, to champion their desperate personal interests, and against all odds calling for the cancellation of the most peaceful and credible process.\n\n\u201cTherefore, as the progressive Youths of Sokoto State, and active stakeholders in the party, we wish to dissociate ourselves and every young persons, which the faceless group has impersonated, from the shambolic call for the cancellation of the Sokoto APC Governorship Primary.\n\n\u201cThe groups are unknown to any structure of our party in Sokoto State, nor neither belong to the party. It is just a creation of some desperate politicians, who are working to achieve their inordinate ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, commend the process of the primary election and also congratulate the winner as we look forward to victory during the election in 2023.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we call on all other aspirants to join hands with Ahmed Aliyu to ensure the party secure victory in the 2023 governorship election in Sokoto State.\u201d",

The team later combed the bush and recovered two AK-47 rifles with a few rounds of their ammunition and three corpses of the assailants.\n\n\u201cThe team made their way to the main enclave of the miscreants and after a thorough ransacking, recovered more exhibits,\u201d he said.\n\nItems recovered from the suspects include; one AK-49 rifle breech number 1984-AM1196, one AK-47 rifle breech number 1971-DF2726, one AR rifle with illegible breech number, 147 rounds of AR ammunition, 38 rounds of AK-47 ammunition, one locally fabricated double-barrelled pistol.\n\nAlso, two walkie-talkie sets and their chargers, two charm-like substances,one hospital card, one Diamond Bank ATM card, two National ID cards, and one Techno phone battery and other incriminating items.\n\n\u201cTwo of the criminals were fatally wounded and were confirmed dead at the hospital,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has hosted the second edition of the Nigerian Telecoms Leadership Summit.\n\nThis is in line with its tradition and commitment to engage with stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem with a view to pursuing proactive regulatory interventions targeted at ensuring an enabling operating environment and improving investment climate in the Nigerian telecom industry.\n\nThe event, which took place at the Eko Hotels, Victoria Island, Lagos, was an assemblage of key industry stakeholders with the central objective to analyse the current state of the sector, process the issues, and chart new pathways to a more effective and sustainable regulatory regime for the stability and growth of the Nigerian telecom industry.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, said that the theme of the Summit: \u201cThe Future of Telecom Regulation in Nigeria,\u201d presented a unique opportunity for the Commission to interact with critical stakeholders.\n\nThrough such interaction, the EVC said the Commission would be able to brainstorm and migrate to new frontiers of visionary regulations that will galvanise and foster desired growth in the industry.\n\nDanbatta explained that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered political and socio-economic uncertainties globally and underscored the crucial role of digital connectivity in keeping societies functioning, as the online life became, essentially, new way of life.\n\nHe stated that with the increased dependence on digital platforms, the theme of the event had become necessary in order to put in place a broader regulatory framework that will enhance and protect the integrity of the industry in the emergent digital economy.\n\nIn this context, the EVC said the NCC will continue to diligently pursue the implementation of policy frameworks such as Nigeria National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025; and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030 which are consistent with NCC\u2019s regulatory interventions such as the Commission\u2019s Strategic Management Plan (SMP), 2020-2024 and Strategic Vision Plan (SVP), 2021-2025, among others.\n\nDanbatta said all the policy and regulatory frameworks principally seek to provide a platform for Nigerian citizens to engage in innovative developments for the telecoms industry and improve the nation\u2019s ability to compete in the ever-competitive global space.\n\nExplaining further on the transformation happening as a result of the expanding spectrum of the digital ecosystem, Danbatta said the industry is witnessing new business delivery and breakthroughs due to the expansion of boundaries of digital Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), especially fintech and e-commerce firms. The EVC said those consequential ecosystems have contributed to the growth of the Nigerian digital economy riding on telecom infrastructure.\n\nDanbatta aptly reckoned that digital services and contents provided by these SMEs will leverage broadband infrastructure and the upcoming deployment of Fifth Generation (5G) network being driven by the Commission to deliver more innovative and high-quality experiences to consumers.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s successful auction and licensing of the 3.5GHz spectrum licences in the last quarter of 2021 for the deployment of 5G technology is set to create many opportunities for the development of the industry and as a regulator, we are conversant with the fact that a dynamic regulatory environment is needed to sustain this industry growth\u201d, Danbatta said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it has become imperative for us, as critical stakeholders, to appraise the progress made so far as an industry and chart the course for the future of the telecoms industry in the country,\u201d he stated. The EVC also informed that one of the sectors that had been positively impacted by the digital transformation is the financial services sector.\n\nAmplifying the EVC\u2019s position, in his keynote address titled: \u201cThe Future of Telecom Regulation in Nigeria: Challenges of Access to Funding\u201d, the\n\nChief Executive Officer of Stanbic IBTC, Dr. Ademola Sogunle, asserted that the telecommunications industry had become the sustaining stimulus of the post-pandemic era as consumers\u2019 behaviours continue to shift towards digital trends. Danbatta said that the contribution of the telecom sector continues to benefit the entire ecosystem.\n\nWhile reviewing resolutions of the first edition of the Summit held in 2019, the Director, Policy, Competition and Economic Analysis, NCC, Yetunde Akinloye, said the Commission had implemented the recommendations of that meeting among which were Executive Order on Duplicity of Taxes and Levies, and Harmonization of Right of Way (ROW) fees.\n\nShe said other recommendations implemented include addressing of interconnect debt, review of the framework on interconnect clearing houses to ensure 10 per cent of traffic is routed through clearing houses, incentive for small operators as well as monitoring compliance with Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nTo sustain the momentum from the previous industry leadership engagement, this year\u2019s Summit provided the Chief Executives of companies in the telecom sector an opportunity to meet the EVC and top Management of the Commission at a roundtable for deeper thinking and greater reflection on the challenges in the sector and proffer meaningful solutions.",

          "title": "Buhari and his unfolding succession plan",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari dropped the hint few months ago. During a live television interview, he told the nation that he had a preferred presidential candidate, although he did not disclose his identity.\n\nAlso, few weeks ago, his media adviser, Femi Adesina, confirmed that his boss will anoint an aspirant, stressing that he has the right to endorse in his capacity as a Nigerian, politician and leader.\n\nYesterday, the president indicated that he was ready to unveil his candidate for next year\u2019s election.\n\nHowever, he is seeking collaboration with party stakeholders to ensure a smooth selection.\n\nIn searching for a successor or trying to anoint a candidate, it appears the president is taking into consideration three issues. The first is the public mood. Thus, he wishes to uphold national interest.\n\nThe second is the mood of the party because it is the platform that will field the aspirant as standard bearer.\n\nThe third is comparative analysis of the opposition candidate and flagbearer of the ruling party. The president wants his party to retain power. Therefore, he is locked in introspection. He wants to encourage APC to throw up a popular candidate who can win election.\n\nThese challenges stare President Buhari and the party in the face, six days to the presidential primary scheduled for Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nAfter the consultation with the governors, they too decided to brainstorm on the speech.\n\nAhead of nominations for 2023 polls, the National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had declared that APC governors should call the shots as leaders of state chapters. The governors anointed their successors and endorsed most of the parliamentary candidates in their respective states.\n\nThe President noted that \u201cthe party has successfully established internal policies that promote continuity and smooth succession plans.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that \u201cfirst term governors who have served credibly well have been encouraged to stand for re-election. Similarly, second term governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.\u201d\n\nSome of them also picked tickets to contest for the Senate.\n\nUrging APC to replicate the procedure at the presidential primary, the president pleaded that the outcome of the primary should reflect the changing dynamics of public expectation and the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles.\n\nIn particular, the president emphasised that the candidate should be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence, even before the elections.\n\nIn keeping with what he has affirmed as the established internal policies of the party, President Buhari solicited what he described as \u201cthe reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders\u201d in picking his successor, who would fly the presidential flag.\n\nTo build support for the proposal, he promised to sustain the consultation involving all aspirants and stakeholders up to the day of convention.\n\nThe President has anticipated the tension likely to be unleashed by his course of action. Therefore, he said that consultation is critical to the diffusion of \u201canxiety occasioned by different factors.\u201d\n\nStakeholders and other observers have been dissecting the President\u2019s speech to the governors.\n\nSince last week, attention has shifted to the APC, following the transparent, democratic and substantially free and fair primary that threw up former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as candidate. Majority of party members look forward to a similar seamless process at the coming APC convention.\n\nAs the leader of the party, President Buhari is soliciting for unity. This is very essential. To that extent, he is objective. A divided party cannot win election. A fractured party will be overrun by the opposing party that is more cohesive. That happened to the PDP in 2014/2015 when it was decimated and weakened by intra-party squabbles.\n\nThe president also laid out the criteria that the APC candidate should possess. He said he should be one that is generally accepted and can win the 2023 election. Therefore, he is realistic.\n\nThe choice, he said, should elicit optimism in the party\u2019s rank and file . This is of utmost importance as the PDP has picked a candidate it believes can lead it to victory.\n\nShould the President\u2019s preferred candidate fall below expectation, it will be difficult to sell him to the electorate. The consequence is that the candidate will be rejected by voters.\n\nThe president also spoke about the need for the APC to pick a thorough-bred party man. His prescription is also difficult to fault. The choice must be one who symbolises the party\u2019s virtues; someone who had toiled and sweated for the party to be the formidable force that it is today.\n\nThe implication is that the aspirant should be a co-party founder and joint builder, and an aspirant who has mass appeal.\n\nThe president specifically called on the governors and other stakeholders to join him to ensure that the process of choosing his successor is rancour- free.\n\nIs this a subtle way of asking the governors to allow him to choose the flagbearer the same way he allowed them to pick their would-be successors ?\n\nHas he passed the message to the governors and only enjoining them to see to its execution the same manner that his choice of Adamu was ratified by the governors and later, by the April convention?\n\nHow can the process be packaged as a collective enterprise that will not trigger post-primary crisis?\n\nWill the option strengthen or weaken the platform ahead of poll?\n\nA clearer picture will certainly emerge before the week runs out.",

When it suits him, he invokes the name of our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, to blackmail NWC members into accepting his decisions.\n\n\u201cEvery effort to get the chairman to respect the authority of the NWC as elected by March 26, 2022, APC national convention is proving very difficult, if not impossible. Note that NEC\u2019s donation of its powers was to NWC and not to the national chairman or any individual.\u201d\n\nThey defended their action, saying they were worried by what they termed the continued breach of the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nLukman and Kekemeke added: \u201cThe national chairman must be properly reminded to recognise that the business of managing the day-to-day affairs of the party is the responsibility of the NWC as provided in provisions of the APC Constitution.\n\n\u201cHe is free to consult any party leader(s). Such consultations will not represent decisions of the NWC or any organ of the party unless and until it is adopted by a properly constituted meeting of the NWC or organ in question according to the letters and spirit of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201dAs a party, we have suffered enough judicial embarrassments arising from clearly avoidable leadership breach of our party\u2019s constitution and spelt out rules.\n\n\u201cAs members of the NWC who have the mandate of our members, we hereby serve notice to His Excellency, Abdullahi Adamu, and through him to all APC leaders that henceforth, any decision taken by the national chairman or any other party functionary, which requires the approval of the NWC as enshrined in the APC constitution, will be considered as illegitimate and an infringement on the jurisdictional scope of the NWC, unless otherwise confirmed as validly approved decisions of the NWC or any other legitimate organ of the party.\n\n\u201dNo NWC member was elected at the March 26, 2022, National Convention to warm seats or offices in the national secretariat. We, therefore, call on all our colleagues in the NWC to rise to these challenging situations by joining hands with us to save our great party and return it to its founding mission of moving Nigeria forward based on an honest, fair, just and selfless commitment to party building.\u201d",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAlready, the names of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom; Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta and former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, have been mentioned as those being considered for the position.\n\nWike came second in the presidential primary of the PDP with 237 votes, while Emmanuel came fourth, polling 38 votes. Anyim came fifth with 14 votes. Wike had said that those around Atiku had no election value, in what some people see implying that a running mate should be someone who would win votes, as he did in the presidential primary.\n\nSources revealed that apart from Wike, Emmanuel, Okowa and Anyim, the search for the running mate has widened in the South East, with fresh names being mentioned.\n\nBreaking!!!

Saraki worked with Ekweremadu in the 8th Senate, against stiff opposition by senators elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as him.\n\nThe Saraki elements, it was gathered, believe that Ekweremadu is trustworthy and stands for whatever cause he believes in.\n\nThe snag about Elweremadu, however, is the feelings that he may defect to the APC to pursue his governorship ambition. The former Deputy Senate president, who lost out in the Enugu PDP, is believed to be holding talks with APC leadership on the possibility of him getting the governorship ticket in state if he joins the party.\n\nIt was gathered that those who mentioned the name of Nnamani reckoned that the senator is popular in South East, as a two-time governor and serving senator. The popularity and potency of Nnamani\u2019s Ebeano group, which has produced the majority of the elected leaders in Enugu State till date, including the current governorship candidate of the PDP in the state, Mr. Peter Mbah, was counted as what stands Nnamani out.\n\nIhedioha, it was gathered, is being mentioned by those working with Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal. With Tambuwal stepping down for Atiku during the presidential primary, it was gathered that his supporters want him to nominate a running mate to Atiku. Ihedioha, who was Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives when Tambuwal was Speaker, is their choice, even as the former governor supporter Tambuwal in his quest for PDP presidential ticket.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that Atiku is only receiving nominations and engaging in broad consultation, so that he would make a choice that would be acceptable to stakeholders in South East and South South.\n\nSources revealed that the PDP candidate does not want a repeat of the controversy when he picked former Anambra State governor and now presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, as running mate in 2019.\n\nWhen Obi was announced as running mate to Atiku in 2019, there was initial misgiving as governors of the South East and PDP leaders in the zone said they were not taken into confidence, in accordance with agreement with Atiku before supporting him at the presidential primary, which took place in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

I was quite impressed by the efforts of the convention committee, which was headed by former Senate President, Senator David Mark, and his assistants, particularly, the Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri. But, sadly, the outcome of the election leaves much to be desired; it was very unjust and rather unwholesome. It will definitely impact severe, adverse ramifications on the future unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed by the outrageous and Machiavelli manner in which Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto State, was so apparently \u201carranged\u201d to announce his withdrawal from the contest, at the last minute; his speech changed the mood of the event. That was done in order to foist another Northerner as the party\u2019s flag bearer, having regard to the fact that Governor Aminu Tambuwal was the only aspirant from the whole of the North West, which had about 192 delegates at the convention.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nBreaking!!!

Another Northern aspirant, Mr Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, a businessman from Borno State, had, earlier, also suddenly, withdrawn from the contest, citing its obscene monetization as his reason; but we now know better.\n\n\u201cIt is now widespread understanding that there were pressures mounted on Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, and former Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki, to also withdraw, while Tambuwal deliberately delayed his action till the last minute. By so doing, unduly swept his North West votes to Atiku Abubakar.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

And after doing so, he took photographs with every individual and each of the delegates present at those events.\n\n\u201cSo you can see that he is determined and is prepared, and he has done his own work, and he\u2019s not taking our party members for granted. And he wants to let them know his vision, his agenda and what he will do, you know, not just for this country, but even for them as members of the party, if and when he\u2019s elected.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP), Senator Kabiru Gaya said they were impressed by his qualifications and experience, saying he\u2019s the only candidate that can defeat the presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\n\nHe said Osinbajo has been in the system for many years as the vice president and he has also acted as a president, adding that he\u2019s the most experienced aspirant in this race.\n\n\u201cWe believe that he will be a candidate for the APC general election and he is the only candidate that can beat Atiku Abubakar. That I\u2019m sure of,\u201d Gaya added\n\nOn his part, Lawan noted that he was ready to support any of the aspirants that the party decides to pick as a consensus.\n\nAccording to him, We are sons and daughters of the same father and mother, those of us in APC, all of us who took the forms to run for the highest office of the president believing in the same philosophy and ideology of our party. Therefore, we are one and the same thing. I will support anybody who the party and who the president thinks can do better for us. I have no problem with that. I want to also believe that at the end of the day, I will emerge.\u201d\n\nLawan noted that if elected, Nigeria would experience improved education, security and economy.\n\nHis words: \u201cI have worked very closely with President Muhammadu Buhari in my capacity as Senate Leader. I know the issue of developments, where we have recorded so much successes, I know where we have to rework the tool and rekit our system, strategy and operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to reform the educational sector that will serve the sons and daughters of nobody so that we are able to take away from the street the 15 or so million out-of-school children.\n\n\u201cI want to see a situation where I will come as the elected party candidate and, of course, go ahead to defeat the PDP and other political parties to win the presidency for APC and for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\nEmmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo\n\nThe Prelate of the Methodist Church in Nigeria, His Eminence Samuel Kanu-Uche has revealed that the Church paid a ransom of N100 million to secure freedom for him and two other priests following their abduction on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHe made this known Tuesday at a news conference in Lagos during which he narrated the ordeal they passed through in the hands of their abductors, who according to him, were eight in number.\n\nThe governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, had in a press release signed by his chief press secretary, Onyebuchi Ememenka gave the impression that no ransom was paid before the clerics were freed on Monday.\n\nHe attributed the release of \u201cthe eminent men of God within 24 hours of their abduction to the grace of God, the fervent prayers of the Christian Community and the well coordinated response from security agencies in Abia State\u201d.\n\nBut while the Prelate acknowledged the hands of God in protecting them and safeguarding their lives as they passed through torture in the hands of the evil men, he outrightly stated that neither the security agencies nor government played any role in securing their release.\n\nAccording to him, the huge amount of money paid for their freedom was arranged in five sacks of N20 million each, adding that the kidnappers came in an unmarked pickup van and collected the money at the spot it was dropped for them.\n\nThe head of the Methodist Church in Nigeria said that the ransom money was raised by Church members.\n\nFrantic efforts to raise the money had commenced on Monday immediately the kidnappers made contact and demanded for N100 million before they would free the clerics.\n\nThe Secretary of the Methodist Church Conference, the Rt. Revd. Michael Akinwale had in a statement on Monday appealed to all parishioners to rise up and help in raising the N100 million ransom. He also provided the account number of the Church domiciled with First Bank.\n\nAside from admitting the payment of ransom, the Methodist Prelate also made other revelations confirming that Fulani herdsmen were behind the business of kidnapping for ransom in Abia.\n\nHe identified the gang that abducted him and his fellow clerics as \u201cFulani boys\u201d; adding that their leader, who said he was born in Amuzukwu Umuahia, is about 35 years while others were in their teens.\n\nThe Prelate lamented the apparent indifference of the security agencies to the atrocities being committed by the Fulani herdsmen along the axis of evil within Umunneochi and Isuikwuato local governments of Abia.\n\n\u201cBut the irony of it is that where they(kidnappers) were situated, the soldiers all of Fulani extraction, Nigerian soldiers, they were there at Lokpa junction and these boys were going behind them. Meanwhile they kept their cows somewhere, numbering about 200\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He should, therefore, no longer consider himself fit and proper to retain his position as the National Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), and should resign now.\u201d\n\nThe leader of PANDEF also said some aspirants from the south failed because they refused to be steadfast in their demand for a \u201csouthern presidency\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne can now appreciate the reasons given by Mr Peter Obi for his withdrawal from the PDP, both as a member, and as an aspirant, few days before the party\u2019s primary.

His undignified and parochial conduct, to please his northern principals, is not only a big disgrace to the office he occupies but, also, a sad display of lewd subservience to the political subjugation of one ethnic group, in a diverse country like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSenator Iyorchia Ayu\u2019s appalling, thoughtless and unpatriotic public conduct bears grave negative consequences. He should, therefore, no longer consider himself fit and proper to retain his position as the National Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), and should resign now.\u201d\n\nThe leader of PANDEF also said some aspirants from the south failed because they refused to be steadfast in their demand for a \u201csouthern presidency\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne can now appreciate the reasons given by Mr Peter Obi for his withdrawal from the PDP, both as a member, and as an aspirant, few days before the party\u2019s primary. And I would think that what he did was, without doubt, in respect, or obedience, to the position of the southern and middle belt leaders\u2019 forum,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some aspirants from the south believed that, with the resources and facilities at their disposal, their elders no longer matter, and disregarded, with impunity, the patriotic advice on the need to be steadfast on the position of the zoning of the presidency to the south.\n\n\u201cThey never minded that what we have been advocating was in their interest. They proved themselves to be selfish and arrogant, and thought they could win on their own steam. They failed; I can only hope that they have, now, learned their lessons.\u201d",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Egypt-born and Dubai-headquartered mobility startup Swvl, has announced plans to lay off a third of its workforce. The cut will affect 400 people, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Youssef Salem told Bloomberg.\n\nThis announcement was revealed in a letter sent to Swvl employees by CEO Mostafa Kandil on May 30. In the letter, Kandil explained that the effects of the recent global economic downturn have influenced the company\u2019s decision to be Cash Flow positive by 2023.\n\nSwvl, whose merger with Queen\u2019s Gambit Growth Capital in April landed it a valuation of $1.5 billion, became the first African startup to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Since the merger, however, Swvl has lost more than half of that number and is now valued at $581 million.\n\n\u201cNo matter how big, resources are not infinite; cash is meant to be responsibly utilized,\u201d CEO Kandil wrote.\n\nIn addition to this layoff, Kandil added that the company has taken other measures such as the voluntary salary deductions from the top management team; reduction of current office spaces; freezing its current hiring program, as well as travel and accommodation expenses.\n\nSwvl is present in 115 cities and 13 markets globally: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Pakistan. A source disclosed to TechCrunch, that the majority of the layoffs will come from the company\u2019s Dubai and Pakistan offices. The layoffs will focus on roles automated by investments in the Company\u2019s engineering and product and support functions, according to a statement from SWVl.\n\nThe startup has been on an acquisitions spree in the last year, acquiring 4 international startups: UK\u2019s Zeelo, Germany\u2019s door2door, Turkey\u2019s Voltlines, Spain\u2019s Shotl and Argentina\u2019s Viapool.\n\nOver the past 2 months, the economic downturn has forced tech companies across the globe to lay off significant numbers of their workforce.\n\nThis month, Meta and Uber have announced that they\u2019re freezing hiring plans while Netflix laid off 2% of its workforce\u2014about 150 employees and Swedish buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna cut its workforce by 10%.\n\nOver 15,000 tech workers were laid off in May, as startups heed advice from tech investors including Y Combinator and Sequoia Capital to buckle up for hard times and plan for the worst.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, on cutting edge innovation in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA familiar trend in recent years has seen big tech companies announce cutting edge innovations in key markets. For years Africa has barely featured in the conversation, but all that is changing, and Google is playing a big part.\n\nIn 2021, Google announced a $1 billion fund for Africa, an investment that would involve the launch of Equiano, a state of the art subsea cable that promises to change how Africans experience the Internet. It also included a fund for African startups and SMEs among other things.\n\nAt the 2022 Google I/O conference, the tech giant made some exciting announcements that seemingly made all its previous announcements come full circle. In an unprecedented move, Google invited Techpoint Africa for a chat with its CEO to address issues on Google\u2019s innovative efforts in Africa.\n\nIf you just started following tech stories in 2021, it would probably surprise you to know that Google has been launching a number of initiatives across Africa with a majority of them geared toward connectivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve had the defunct Google free WiFi initiative and Project Loon. One involved installing stations to access the Internet for free, while the other sought to make use of the air balloons to beam Internet signals to remote locations in Kenya.\n\nIn 2019, Google opened its first African artificial intelligence lab in Accra, Ghana to solve basic everyday problems for Africans. Some of these solutions were AI models deployed on phones to diagnose crop diseases.\n\nThe following year, Google launched plus codes, a unique identifier that was basically a street address for people who don\u2019t have one. For a continent like Africa with a fragmented addressing system, this had numerous benefits for different sectors like logistics, health, and governance (read census and elections).\n\nDespite all these initiatives, Sundar Pichai still believes that Google should be doing more for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe have a renewed focus on Africa. In some ways, we\u2019re using a template which has worked well in other countries. For instance, in other parts of the world, we\u2019ve announced a focused development fund, over a period of time. And which works on many pillars like small businesses, digital skilling, AI centres and talent.\u201d\n\nRecall that in January 2022, Google announced a $1 billion fund in India to provide affordable access to smartphones and speed up the uptake of cloud computing. This is eerily similar to the $1 billion Africa development fund which Pichai says has been a big focus for the company.\n\nWhile the Indian fund saw the company partner with Bharti Airtel, its recent launch of Equiano has seen partnerships with up to 10 major African telcos. The focus on networking and the launch of a product development centre in Kenya also hints at a major cloud computing future.\n\nBeyond connectivity, Google\u2019s efforts are seemingly geared toward plugging infrastructure gaps in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Google maps have ever left you stranded before, that\u2019s mainly a symptom of Africa\u2019s informal housing system which we referenced above. According to the World Bank, African cities face a major housing challenge with the increase in urban slums. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 20% of the people living in slums.\n\nIn 2021, the tech behemoth used Artificial Intelligence to map up to 300 million buildings in Africa, five times more than the 60 million recorded in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re opening up the datasets for the World Bank and the United Nations so they can use this data for their programs,\u201d Google\u2019s CEO reveals, adding that, \u201c the moment is right for Africa and increasing Internet penetration, the entrepreneurship we\u2019re seeing, and access to technology and training will position it well.\u201d\n\nOn Google\u2019s platforms in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Google\n\nBesides infrastructure plays, one of Google\u2019s iconic platforms, the Android OS is incredibly popular in Africa. Stats counter states that more than half of African smartphone users use the Android platform.\n\nHowever, Google\u2019s flagship Android phone, Google Pixel, has struggled to make inroads in Africa.\n\nAt the Google I/O conference, the company announced the addition of several initiatives including the Pixel 6a which officially costs just a little more than \u20a6200,000 ($499). But if the pricing of the Pixel 6 gives us any indication, then it would be significantly more expensive in Nigeria. For context, the Pixel 6 officially cost \u20a6250,000 ($599) at launch, but Nigerian retailers typically sold the pixel between \u20a6400,000 \u2013 \u20a6500,000 ($1,000 \u2013 $1,200).\n\nPichai revealed that supply constraints have prevented the Pixel from fully launching in Africa and several other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen you do hardware, it\u2019s not enough, if you launch in a country. You have to invest in a supporting cast of things. You need to have retail partnerships, you have to have deep carrier partnerships, you have to make sure some localized content is available, and you have to make sure you have a marketing program that works in that country.\u201d\n\nPichai says the focus has been on scaling it country by country. Spreading Pixel to Europe, India, and Japan. However, Africa might need a very different strategy.\n\n\u201cPixel is at a higher price point for Africa, so the work we\u2019re doing with original equipment manufacturers is very very important, and that has become a big, big focus for us as well.\u201d\n\nAt $499 The Pixel 6a is the cheapest in Google\u2019s latest phone lineup. By comparison, the global behemoth, Samsung, retails the Galaxy AO3 at \u20a645,000 ($108). Pichai\u2019s statement foreshadows more affordable pixel phones that would be targeted at the African market.\n\nHowever, Africa still has a long way to go regarding innovation, and Google appears to be playing the long game for now. Its fledgeling YouTube creator program, and its privacy policies which have allowed loan sharks to run amok present positive and negative aspects of using Google\u2019s products in Africa. From all indications, Africa is about to hit a new era with big tech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and narrator of technology, business and policies in Africa . Looking to chat?

          "title": "How Joram Mwinamo has helped Kenyans make sense of their businesses since 2007",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn California, it\u2019s Silicon Valley. In Kenya, it\u2019s Silicon Savannah. There are many Silicon Savannahs in Africa. Just think of major African cities with tech hubs, and you\u2019re there. Interestingly, this article is about Joram Mwinamo, someone who is actively participating in the evolution of tech businesses in Kenya and has been part of the entrepreneurship ecosystem since 2007.\n\nIf you spend ten minutes with Joram, he\u2019ll spend eight talking about tech\u2019s potential and how he\u2019s been helping businesses tap into it by helping them make sense of the problem from a human angle.\n\n\u201cHaving that good understanding of human problems and being able to break them down, and then create solutions, and walk backwards to create technology to address the problems, based on the technology that you build, you find that now you\u2019re able to extract data, speed up certain processes, [and] have objective information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nJoram is a seasoned Kenyan entrepreneur who runs with a school of thought that if a founder is only good at building a product and terrible at everything else, it will affect the startup\u2019s overall success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably one of those people, who, even when we have an extended technology discussion, I discuss more of the non-technology than the technology itself because I find that a lot of technologists look at the tools and solutions a bit too much. I come from a philosophy of looking at the real problems first and then seeing what kind of technology will be helpful in solving it.\u201d\n\nIt was around this that he created his lofty plan \u2014 building 5,000 consortiums across the world. Now, we have to answer a few questions: What drives Joram? What\u2019s unique about his approach? What\u2019s his background? How far has he come?\n\nSetting the ball rolling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you ask Joram about himself, 80% of the time, he\u2019s instinctively talking about how he has played and is still playing his part to support the Kenyan entrepreneurship ecosystem. But that is not all there is to know about him.\n\nDuring our chat, he fondly remembered the small beginnings; however, he is proud of how far he has come. In a little over a decade, Kenya has become a hotspot for the big guns. The country\u2019s capital, Nairobi, houses Microsoft\u2019s first Africa Development Centre, Google\u2019s proposed first Product Development Centre on the continent, and Amazon\u2019s planned AWS Local Zone launch.\n\nGrowing up in a middle-class family in Nairobi, Joram studied computer science at Egerton university. This leaves one wondering why anyone would make such a decision in 2002 when the potential of tech and the importance of the Internet were not appreciated in Africa yet.\n\n\u201cI realise I was introduced to technology a bit early. Because of that experience, I did have some exposure to coding quite early and gotten comfortable with technology. Where my dad, in the work that he used to do, was a civil servant, but somehow he linked up with some South African consultancy, and as a result, we ended up with one or two computers at home, and one was like a mini-computer, and the other one was like one of those really early laptops. I remember tinkering around with it. This was maybe 1995/96.\u201d\n\nAs an undergraduate, his involvement with AIESEC paved the way. The organisation, which focuses on cultural exchange and professional and leadership development, allowed him to work outside his country for two years as a graduate: first in Uganda as a project manager and then in Norway.\n\n\u201cAnd then, when I came back to Kenya, I was still not clear whether I would continue being employed or run a business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before he knew what he wasn\u2019t interested in doing \u2014 being employed for a hardcore tech role. Together with a friend who had a similar tech background, Joram registered a management consulting company called WYLDE International in 2007 after discovering that businesses face challenges primarily because of their owners\u2019 mindsets.\n\nOf drive and eccentricity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nInstead of focusing on hardcore tech requiring coding and building products with his computer science degree, Joram and his friend chose to solve human problems differently by helping businesses make sense of their solutions and unique value propositions. Today he is chasing his passion full steam ahead, with everything he has done to date in pursuit of this dream.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about Joram\u2019s drive, it is majorly about serving others.\n\n\u201cI kept seeing a gap on the human side of interaction with technology. I have always seen that people could be excellent at the technology aspect of building up the codes but terrible at understanding the problems that that code is supposed to go and solve. I\u2019ve been very passionate about promoting individual local solutions to the challenges that businesses face and helping them access the kind of solutions that would help them to grow.\u201d\n\nWith more clients coming in for management consulting, Joram discovered the problem runs deeper than that; it was only a matter of time before Joram decided to do something bigger. And in 2020, Joram co-founded SNDBX, an entrepreneur support hub \u2014 an upgrade from WYLDE. Being ambitious, he needed to create something that would help similarly ambitious entrepreneurs avoid mistakes while building and scaling their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have a bit of a unique setup. What would traditionally be looked at as an incubator/accelerator? What we have in addition is that we also bring together about 33 different professional services under one roof so that as people build their businesses, they also look for access to things like legal services, governance, HR, marketing, branding, literally everything. We\u2019re able to avail those services as well, and so people can build holistic services that can grow and scale. And of course, this being Nairobi, a lot of these businesses are in the tech space, but we also deal with quite a number of businesses outside of that as well.\u201d\n\nJoram calls it a consortium. Think of it this way, you have an idea for a soon-to-launch business in Kenya, and you need professional advice. When you arrange a meeting with Joram or any of his nine team members and have a discussion, you can access recommended professional services immediately because they are all under the same roof.\n\nA quick reminder that even before SNDBX, Joram was always all about entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch.\n\nAnd this is where his story gets a bit interesting; Joram is not always excited about new technologies because he\u2019s all for the useful tech elements that have a return on investment. However, he has remained relevant by keeping up with the latest trends, especially how they key into the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cEven though I couldn\u2019t code to save my life today, I would be very comfortable in a technology solution conversation, and probably being able to then make the best decision around, for example, which language or which platform or which hardware or software would be best to tackle a specific type of solution.\n\n\u201cI read local and international magazines about just what\u2019s happening out there. I\u2019m subscribed to quite a number of forums online that talk about the trends of what\u2019s happening almost on a daily basis. The podcasts that I listen to, of different authorities around the world or YouTube videos that I watch keep me sufficiently updated.\u201d\n\nSomewhere down the line, Joram picked up and developed human-centred design skills, which he considers very important to what he does.\n\n\u201cCertain human behaviours look simple but understanding them makes [them] more valuable\u2026 and I find out that a lot of people take such thing[s] for granted.\u201d\n\nOf gains and keeping it together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nHe\u2019s excited about the prospects that Africa\u2019s local challenges present. In a breath, he mentioned different ideas he\u2019s been playing around with for Africa\u2019s informal sector: something to make payment seamless for the hawker in traffic, an inventory system for a second-hand clothing vendor, or a solution to fund Africa\u2019s communal life.\n\nUnsurprisingly, stories about how he has helped different businesses steer themselves towards success are at the top of Joram\u2019s success list. He is proud to be helping the continent create more entrepreneurs building multinationals and startups that have gone beyond the continent\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cFor me, one of the most fulfilling things is to see an entrepreneur translate the knowledge that they are learning into actions within the business and then begin to see the growth and hire more business people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he\u2019s sometimes limited by the challenges facing businesses on the continent.\n\nJoram agrees that being a husband and father of four while being stretched at work can be challenging, but he seems to be managing alright. On a regular day, he drops his kids at school before heading to work, where he meets with his team and customers, responds to emails, and does work-related reading.\n\nDoing most of his work on his phone definitely helps, so he\u2019s available to respond to work in real-time and get things out of the way by delegating while on the move. Evenings are for spending time with his family, exercising, listening to podcasts, and reading; he\u2019s currently writing a book about entrepreneurship which he plans to launch this year.\n\nBy the way, there\u2019s something interesting about how he can maintain a work-life balance. He is calendar-driven, but while calendar scheduling is highly recommended for time management, Joram optimises it to prioritise his family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had to have that philosophy of building in the rocks first. If you look at my digital calendar, I have built in all I do with my family first; those are already built into my calendar, and a lot of people find it surprising that I keep it in my calendar. After building all the family stuff, then I\u2019ll now come back and build in the important work meetings that are recurring. Then after that is when I plan everything else. I also try to have a one-week holiday every quarter.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp and notepad also come in handy to keep communication going and log ideas. Meanwhile, he dreams of a time when there would be 5,000 SNDBXs across major cities worldwide.\n\n\u201cIf I live long enough, we plan to have a SNDBX in every continent, in every country possible. So, the number I have in my head is 5,000 SNDBXs across the world. All the way in the different cities in China, in South America, in the US, in Europe.\u201d\n\nBut he fears not being able to implement the ideas in his head before time runs out. He agrees that this makes him uncomfortable with slow execution.\n\nTalking of his philosophy, Joram says, \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve realised that a lot of what we\u2019re unable to achieve is maybe because of pride or ego, not being able to ask for help. So, I find myself nowadays asking for help a lot and very quickly and very early rather than trying to struggle at something that I\u2019m not very good [at] doing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

The ongoing sale is being held auction style using its native token, $VHC.\n\nAs part of the land sale, a free HTC VIVE Flow VR glasses will be given per parcel of land bought. However, to ensure scarcity and value, a limited number of virtual land (VLAND) parcels have been made available for purchase due to the high number already sold during the private sale round.\n\nLand parcels are currently being sold in the Vitality and Play districts of the metaverse, and using Vault Hill\u2019s interactive map, prospective land buyers and those who already participated in the private land sale can view which districts still have available VLAND. The map can also be used to explore the brands and creators that have already purchased land in the metaverse.\n\nThe VHC land parcels are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721) which are unique and distinct. The land has been grouped into four categories\u2013 standard, premium, deluxe and exclusive \u2013 each with their own unique offering.\n\nThe exclusive land type for instance can be merged to form a cluster of up to 8 land parcels, and it also has a courtyard in its center. Not only will Exclusive landowners benefit from a prime location, but owners of all 8 parcels that form a cluster have a unique advantage of monetising the courtyard to the limits of their imagination. Owners could erect a billboard in the courtyard, or even stadiums, conference centers, art installation, etc.\n\nOne of the many benefits of being a virtual land owner in VHC is that VHC is the first virtual world that combines all aspects of users\u2019 reality leveraging seven basic human instincts to enhance experiences in the metaverse. It is also the first virtual world with urban planning and development benefits to ensure users build on their virtual land respectfully.\n\nAdditionally, land owners will be given a \u2018NO CODE\u2019 builder tool which gives them total creative freedom to build their desired edifice without having to learn a single line of code. These edifices could range from cinemas, fitness studios, museums, libraries, event centers, etc. There are limitless opportunities for land owners in VHC be it individual investors or brands seeking to establish their presence in web3.\n\nVisit Vault Hill\u2019s marketplace now for your chance to own a piece of the world\u2019s first human-centric metaverse. Further information regarding the land sale can be found here and the metaverse development timeline can be viewed in the whitepaper. Updates can be gotten in real-time via the social pages \u2013 Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Discord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

Their product offering consists of token rewards networks, digital identification systems, user-controlled data profiles, and a crypto and NFT wallet specifically designed to empower content creators.\n\nAs such, Cassava is a new incentives platform for Africans and the regional market, as CSV will enable projects, content creators including NFT artists, video creators, and content consumers to earn rewards in innovative ways through play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and engage-to-earn models. Additionally, it will offer CSV holders a portfolio of incentives, including lending, staking, AMM, and voting rights for platform governance.\n\nWhy Cassava Network?\n\nCassava offers a unique opportunity for African creatives to build digital economies, protect their intellectual properties and connect with the global market at large, through an easy-to-use multifunctional wallet that can be integrated with apps for user incentivization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cassava Network\u2019s PR Director, Kelin said \u201cCassava Network will use the investment capital to expand and improve its technological capabilities in order to leverage the Web3 economy to drive crypto mass adoption across Africa and beyond. The next phase of Cassava development will include a multi-chain wallet that incentivizes users, an African-focused NFT Marketplace, and a rewards system that pays users for transacting and using apps in Cassava\u2019s ecosystem. \u201d\n\nThe market opportunity in the African creative space is enormous. Africa has one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations, as well as the highest proportion of entrepreneurs among its working-class adults. Cassava is designed for the innovative youth seeking pan-African connectivity, and a global reach that will translate into sustainable, income-generating opportunities.\n\nWith regards to the global blockchain market, Africa alone is expected to possess a 30% market share and grow from a $1.1 billion market in 2020 to a $134.9 billion market by 2028.\n\n\u201cEMURGO Africa is excited to support the development of Cassava Network\u2019s innovative content rewards ecosystem. We firmly believe Africa is a huge market full of bright potential that can lead the way to spur large user growth and demonstrate the real benefits of a flourishing Web3 economy,\u201d said Shogo Ishida, Executive Director for the Middle East & Africa at EMURGO Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about this partnership, which will help fund the revolutionary DeFi tool, which enables mobile applications to migrate to web 3.0 functionality that rewards content creation and user engagement. We are inspired and driven by projects with a strong use case, a resilient founder, and a long term vision to bring change to socio-economic challenges in Africa\u201d said Vincent Li Founding Partner at Adaverse.\n\nAbout Adaverse\n\nAdaverse is a Cardano-focused joint accelerator initiative \u2014 set up with the collaboration of EMURGO Africa, a subsidiary of EMURGO, the official commercial arm of the Cardano protocol, and Everest Ventures Group, a leading blockchain industry accelerator \u2014 looking to build the infrastructure of the projected $139.4 billion African blockchain market by 2028.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for doctors\u2019 collaboration to sustain reforms in the healthcare sector, ensuring a resilient and equitable system to deliver efficient, quality and affordable healthcare services to Edo people.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the new executives of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Hospital Management Agency, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who noted that he is pursuing a holistic reform in the sector and putting in place mechanisms to discourage manpower for healthcare delivery from leaving the country, urged the doctors to support the government\u2019s effort at strengthening the system and curbing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need more doctors, particularly with the way the doctors are traveling out for greener pastures. What we need is to strengthen the institutions that produce doctors. We are strengthening our educational system to produce more doctors.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration is tackling the age-old challenges in the health sector such as dearth of modern medical equipment, decaying healthcare infrastructure, inadequate personnel and poor funding, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe system we inherited and structure put in place at that time was meant for that time but today the society has changed, leading to the reforms in our medical sector. We must rethink the sector we inherited.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cMedical healthcare is global and standardized and as such, we need to measure up. We need to restructure our healthcare system in the state. The COVID-19 pandemic is an eye-opener for us as everyone was restricted from moving around. The lesson is that we must fix our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe have insisted on healthcare reforms. This is why I brought down the central hospital to decentralize the healthcare system in the state, ensuring that there is at least one healthcare facility in every community to ensure healthcare is closer to the people.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on how to produce more doctors by strengthening the basic education system and giving quality education to produce more doctors for the state. We need more than 200 new doctors in the system, who will be in the community to take charge of the PHCs across the state and must be motivated and encouraged to stay here.\u201d\n\nReacting to the doctor\u2019s request to be included in the N40,000 new minimum wage, the governor said, \u201cDoctors are special breeds of civil servants and earn more and should not be asking for minimum wage. You are civil servants but the only set of civil servants who earn more than the governor. A consultant in your system earns twice what I earn as a governor. Why should you be asking for minimum wage? What the government did is to help those at the bottom because people go through a lot every day.\n\n\u201cThe wage is to help those at the bottom to pass the poverty threshold. Certainly, there are allowances due to you but subject to negotiation. We don\u2019t like making promises we cannot fulfill as a government. This is one of the quarrels we have with the federal government. You can\u2019t go and negotiate a labour contract and impose it on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we respect labour which is why we have not had any strike regarding allowances or wages in the state as the welfare of our workers is important to us,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and president of the association, Dr. Uaboi Ovbiagele commended the governor for the holistic reforms in the healthcare sector, pledging their support to sustain reforms in the sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun government has reiterated its commitment to meeting the needs of the citizens even as the state prepares for an election.\n\nThe government noted that it remains resolute to its commitment to monthly distribution of food items to the citizens, saying saying that not even the gubernatorial election could distract it from implementing the scheme.\n\nThis is as the government flagged off the 14th edition of the Osun Food Support Scheme in line with its commitment to bringing succour to the people and banishing the scourge of hunger and poverty in the State.\n\nSpeaking during the flag-off ceremony at the Multi-Purpose Hall of the Local Government Service Commission, State Government Secretariat, Abere, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola said the scheme was not designed for political patronage, hence the need for its continuation and sustainability since its inception.\n\nRepresented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, the Governor noted that the scheme which had become a point of reference to many would be implemented throughout the period of his administration and God willing, it will continue when re-elected for second term.\n\n\u201cWe will recall that 14 months ago, this scheme was launched by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and he made a promise that the food items would be distributed to the generality of the people of the State, most importantly the vulnerable citizens.\n\n\u201cThis has continued and we are glad to say that this is the 14th edition. The issue of election has absolutely nothing to do with the promise made to the people as to their welfare. We are a government, and government and governance continue to run regardless of election because it is our firm belief that we have a statutory obligation to ensure their welfare and general well-being.\n\n\u201cThe economic impact of this is enormous because if you look at the number of beneficiaries vis-a-vis the economic benefits, you will agree with me that this scheme has really helped to build healthy people and the positive implication of this is that it is only the healthy people that can engage actively in productive economic activities.\n\n\u201cSo, we strongly believe that we are impacting both the people and the economy of the State. After all, the food items are bought from within, that is, among our people and there is an economic chain and value to this process.\n\n\u201cOur social intervention initiative goes beyond this monthly food support scheme. We have initiated series of people-oriented programmes that had directly and indirectly impacted greatly in the lives of the people and election cannot hinder this. We have said this before and we will continue to say it that this initiative is not for political patronage. It is strictly for the people.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the three and a half years of this administration, we have impacted the lives of the people tremendously.\n\nThat is why most of our policies and programmes are people-focused.\n\n\u201cAside this, salaries and pensions are being paid as and when due; road construction is ongoing; there are also improvement in health facility and reorientation on the education system among others. If you look at all these, our people know what to do, and what will they do. They will vote our Governor for second term\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Engr. Olalekan Badmus, said the government has no plan to suspend the programme in view of its numerous impact on the lives of the people.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, this has been impactful. If you look at the 30,000 beneficiaries on monthly basis, one doesn\u2019t need to be told to know the impact of such in the economy of the state and the general well-being of the citizens.\n\n\u201cWe can say it unequivocally that huge success has been recorded as far as this scheme is concerned and we are not resting on our oars to ensure that it continues throughout the period of this administration and by the grace of God, Mr. Governor will continue it in his second term,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nA meeting of the APC governors called Tuesday evening to discuss the stance of President Muhammadu Buhari on the party\u2019s presidential candidate ended in deadlock and soaked in tension, as the president reportedly in clear terms informed them of his resolve to pick his successor, seeking their understanding and support.\n\nThe meeting was held in Abuja, minutes after the APC governors had a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAccording to report, the meeting was deadlocked and they resolved to meet again at 8 p.m.\n\nShortly after informing them of his resolve, the president immediately left for Spain after his meeting with the governors.\n\nThe governors according to sources were in a dilemma on how to implement the president\u2019s request.\n\nOne of them told an online medium on condition of anonymity that:\n\n\u201cWe believe the president has not settled for any particular person and that is why some governors felt the best thing to do was to nominate two of us (one each from the north and south) to the president for consideration.\n\nImmediately, the discussion on how to implement the request took on ethnic colouration as some of the northern governors, reportedly argued that no southern governor could defeat Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, in the presidential election; so the north should be given preference.\n\nThis position, it was learnt did not go down well with some southern governors.\n\nSome of the southern were said to have retorted that the nominees should not necessarily be state governors. This position is believed to have been pushed by governors loyal to some southern presidential candidates such as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and ex-Lagos governor Bola Tinubu.\n\nSince the governors could not agree, they resolved to end the meeting and reconvene at 8 p.m.\n\nBuhari had informed the governors that he would like to pick his successor in order to maintain his legacy.\n\nMr Buhari said this Tuesday at a meeting with governors elected on the APC platform at the State House, Abuja.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the Party and as we approach the Convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the Governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d the president said at the meeting which was also attended by the APC national chairman.\n\nMr Buhari told the governors that he realises the \u2018compelling need\u2019 for him to provide \u2018stronger leadership to the party under this transition process.\u2019\n\nThe stronger leadership, Mr Buhari said, is not only to ensure that APCs electoral fortunes improve but also to ensure that the party \u2018retains power at the centre\u2019 by winning the presidential election.\n\nAt the meeting with the governors, Mr Buhari was said to have listed the factors he would consider in throwing his weight behind a presidential candidate among the 25 persons seeking to fly the APC flag.\n\n\u201cOur objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections,\u201d he said.",

This would also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors are effectively brought under control and that our party emerges stronger.\u201d\n\nFull Speech Below:\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT, FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA, TO THE PROGRESSIVE GOVERNORS\u2019 FORUM AT THE CONSULTATIVE MEETING HELD AT THE PRESIDENTIAL VILLA, ABUJA, ON TUESDAY, 31ST MAY, 2022\n\nI am delighted to address this gathering of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum as part of the consultative processes that have always strengthened the internal dynamics of our Party, the All Progressives Congress, (APC).\n\n2. You will all recall that APC came to power at the center in 2015 through a cohesive machinery, notwithstanding its status as the opposition party. Similarly, in 2019, it was returned to power under my leadership, because of the dividends of democracy delivered to Nigerians irrespective of their political leanings.\n\n3. The Party has since grown in strength and capacity to govern. The key to both electoral successes is the ability of the party to hold consultations and for its members to put the nation above other interests.\n\n4. The transition processes for the 2023 General Elections have commenced in earnest and I note that the most successful Political Parties globally have always relied on their internal cohesion and a strong leadership brand to achieve bigger electoral fortunes. Our party, the APC, shall not be any different, more so as we are still implementing the blueprint for a more prosperous nation.\n\n5. As I begin the final year of my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and leader of the Party, I recognize the compelling need for me to provide stronger leadership to the Party under this transition process and to ensure that it happens in an orderly manner.\n\n6. Such leadership is required so that the Party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the center, hold the great majority in various legislative chambers and also gain additional number of states at state levels.\n\n7. In pursuit of the foregoing objectives, the Party has successfully established internal policies that promote continuity and smooth succession plans even at the state and local government levels. For example, first term Governors who have served credibly well have been encouraged to stand for re-election. Similarly, second term Governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.\n\n8. In a few days, the Party will be holding its Convention during which primaries would take place to pick the Presidential Flag Bearer for the 2023 General Elections. This is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\n\n9. As we approach the Convention, I appeal to all of you to allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens and the global community. Our objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of the candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\n\n10. In keeping with the established internal policies of the Party and as we approach the Convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the Governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n11. I wish to assure you that the consultation process shall continue to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders would be brought on board right through to the convention. This would also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors are effectively brought under control and that our party emerges stronger.\n\n12. I thank you all for listening. God bless you all. God bless our Party, the APC and God bless our nation, Nigeria.",

          "text": "The simmering leadership crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC) appear to have escalated with two members of the National Working Committee (NWC), Salihu Lukman and Isaacs Kekemeke, accusing the national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu of dictatorship.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Lukman, national vice-chairman, north-west, and Kekemeke, national vice-chairman, south-west, alleged that Adamu takes decisions unilaterally.\n\nBoth NWC members said every effort to get Adamu to respect the authority of the committee is proving difficult.\n\nThey said while Adamu is free to make consultations with stakeholders, he must however subject the outcomes of such parleys to deliberations by the NWC rather than his current penchant for adopting such views as position of the NWC.\n\nTitled, \u2018APC and the Need for Vigilance: Urgent Call for Intervention\u2019, the duo in the statement, said they were compelled to make this statement following serial postponement of the scheduled National Working Committee NWC meetings, twice within 48 hours.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced beyond doubt that this is a deliberate attempt to foist a fait accompli on the NWC on fundamental issues that affect our great party\u201d, the stated, in apparent reference to the screening of presidential aspirants ahead of next week\u2019s presidential convention of the party.\n\nLukman had at the weekend written a letter to Sen. Adamu and copied some stakeholders of the party, accusing the party chairman of not learning from the mistakes of his predecessors.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s memo, the duo said the NWC has been rendered redundant within two months of its existence.\n\n\u201cWithin just two months in the lifespan of the new leadership of our great party, APC, led by His Excellency, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, the NWC, organ of the party vested with the power of managing the day-to-day affairs, including implementing decisions of the National Executive Committee (NEC), as provided in Article 13.4 of the APC Constitution, has been rendered redundant.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman takes decisions unilaterally. When it suits him, he invokes the name of our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari to blackmail NWC members into accepting his decisions. Every effort to get the Chairman to respect the authority of the NWC as elected by the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention is proving very difficult, if not impossible. Note that NEC\u2019s donation of its powers was to NWC and not to the National Chairman or any individual\u201d, they stated.\n\nThey said they have no option but to make this public appeal to all APC leaders to intervene and \u201cplease urgently to call our National Chairman, His Excellency, Abdullahi Adamu to order, immediately\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman must be properly reminded to recognize that the business of managing the day-to-day affairs of the party is the responsibility of the NWC as provided in provisions of the APC Constitution.\n\n\u201cHe is free to consult any party leader(s). Such consultations will not represent decisions of the NWC or any organ of the party unless and until it is adopted by a properly constituted meeting of the NWC or organ in question according to the letters and spirits of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we have suffered enough judicial embarrassments arising from clearly avoidable leadership breach of our party\u2019s constitution and spelt out rules. As members of the NWC who have the mandate of our members, we hereby serve notice to His Excellency, Abdullahi Adamu, and through him to all APC leaders that henceforth, any decision taken by the National Chairman or any other party functionary, which require the approval of the NWC as enshrined in the APC constitution, will be considered as illegitimate and an infringement on the jurisdictional scope of the NWC, unless otherwise confirmed as validly approved decisions of the NWC or any other legitimate organ of the party.\n\n\u201cNo NWC member is elected at the March 26, 2022 National Convention to warm seats or offices in the National Secretariat. We therefore call on all our colleagues in the NWC to rise to these challenging situations by joining hands with us to save our great party and return it to its founding mission of moving Nigeria forward based on honest, fair, just and selfless commitment to party building.

          "title": "Manufacturers\u2019 Power Generation Cost Jumps By 12.86% To N45.036bn \u2013 MAN",
          "text": "The manufacturing sector\u2019s expenditure on alternative energy sources for the production of electricity for its operations hit N45.036 billion in the second half of 2021.\n\nThis represents an increase of 12.86 per cent from the N32.18 billion recorded in the first half of the year.\n\nThis was contained in the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) half-year review of the economy from July to December 2021.\n\nAnalysts foresee that manufacturers\u2019 alternative power generation cost will more than double in the current year due the rise in price of crude oil on the international market and attendant scarcity of diesel.\n\nManufacturers have come under intense pressure in recent months as a result of rising crude oil prices which resulted in the astronomical increase in the price of diesel.\n\nThe doubling of diesel prices in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s manufacturing base fighting for survival.\n\nWhile petrol prices in Nigeria are subsidised, diesel prices are unregulated, so the impact of higher crude is immediate and unavoidable.\n\nAccording to research from Chapel Hill Denham, diesel prices are up 129 per cent so far this year, and the firm forecasts that prices will end up 123 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe cost of diesel has become a regular dinner-table topic, said Mickael Vogel, director at the Hawilti research group in Lagos. The only alternative in Nigeria is to use gas, but many smaller companies can\u2019t manage the required capital expenditure, he said.\n\nA lot of companies \u201cdon\u2019t have the cash to buy diesel, but they don\u2019t have the cash to switch to gas either.

          "text": "The manufacturing sector\u2019s expenditure on alternative energy sources for the production of electricity for its operations hit N45.036 billion in the second half of 2021.\n\nThis represents an increase of 12.86 per cent from the N32.18 billion recorded in the first half of the year.\n\nThis was contained in the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) half-year review of the economy from July to December 2021.\n\nAnalysts foresee that manufacturers\u2019 alternative power generation cost will more than double in the current year due the rise in price of crude oil on the international market and attendant scarcity of diesel.\n\nManufacturers have come under intense pressure in recent months as a result of rising crude oil prices which resulted in the astronomical increase in the price of diesel.\n\nThe doubling of diesel prices in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s manufacturing base fighting for survival.\n\nWhile petrol prices in Nigeria are subsidised, diesel prices are unregulated, so the impact of higher crude is immediate and unavoidable.\n\nAccording to research from Chapel Hill Denham, diesel prices are up 129 per cent so far this year, and the firm forecasts that prices will end up 123 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe cost of diesel has become a regular dinner-table topic, said Mickael Vogel, director at the Hawilti research group in Lagos. The only alternative in Nigeria is to use gas, but many smaller companies can\u2019t manage the required capital expenditure, he said.\n\nA lot of companies \u201cdon\u2019t have the cash to buy diesel, but they don\u2019t have the cash to switch to gas either.

          "title": "Why Agege Deserves A Mudashiru Obasa",
          "text": "Joseph De Maistre, the French polemical author, moralist and great exponent of the conservative tradition, who lived between April, 1753 and February, 1821, is credited with one of the most politically correct axiom that has reverberated over time. \u201cEvery nation gets the government it deserves.\u201c\n\nHere, however, we will not be looking at any nation in particular. We will be talking more about Agege, a highly populated metropolitan area of Lagos. It shares boundary with Ikeja, the heart of Lagos where government decisions are taken. As we have seen today, it is only a mischief-filled person who is not blessed with a heart that recognises development and progress that would not see the good that Agege has become.\n\nRecently, Agege was described, figuratively, as a small London by an aide of the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. (Dr) Mudashiru Obasa. And this has not been disputed by anyone. What is also not in dispute is that Agege never had it this good. Its nearness to the seat of power, in terms of distance, had only a minor influence on its growth. Before the emergence of Obasa as Speaker, Agege was just there \u2013 on a \u2018straight line\u2019 not curving upwards.\n\nEven the stunchest of critics understands inside him that Pen Cinema used to be a heartache for motorists and users. You could remain on a spot for many minutes in the midst of an endless crowd of street traders and pedestrians. A distance of less than one kilometre could cost you two hours of your time. With a bridge that was unveiled in 2021, Pen Cinema now has a road network that has been declared of international standard. Obasa happened to the road positively.\n\nThis is just one. Agege has some of the best road networks in today\u2019s Lagos. Any need mentioning other areas of success? Check out the push by the Speaker to ensure the education of the majority. This drive is a topic on its own.\n\nWhen Obasa, a quiet down-to-earth figure, decided to take the mantle of leadership of the legislative arm of government of Lagos in 2015, many, especially the apolitical residents of the State must have laughed it off. They must have thought he was only seeking power for himself. The man knew his direction. He understood what Agege wanted and he knew that such a vantage position would make it easy to attract the dividends of democracy to his people. Today, these same residents now champion the \u201cSpeak Again\u201d mantra. They have seen the result, the influence that such a position wields and ushers.\n\nIt is easy to hear \u201cAgege l\u2019oga wa\u201d. This translates to \u201cAgege is where the boss comes from.\u201d Obasa towers, politically, above his physical size.\n\nThe Neighborhood Safety Corps, initiated through a bill by the Speaker, today has thousands of employees and effectively complements other security agencies. The Lagos Sports law is another that has expanded youth participation in the scheme of progress. Get to Agege and see how the youth speak glowingly and excitedly about Obasa.\n\nFor those who find it mysterious that Obasa has continued to earn the mandates of the people without much hassles, the least is to try and understudy what makes the Speaker thick among his people. Despite the nature Nigeria\u2019s politics, Obasa remains one of the small number of political office holders in Nigeria who could be in the midst of his Agege residents without any safety concern. A Speaker, he continues to live with the people, sharing in their challenges and seeking the best for them. He has never been known to run from his constituents only to return at the twilights of election. Does that sink?\n\nWhy do you then think he will not continue to get the mandates of the people anytime he desires to serve them? The primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held recently in the constituency speaks that much. Apart from the fact that he won without an opponent, his leadership skills were brought to bear before the exercise. The primary election in Agege was one of the most peaceful in the State.\n\nAgege people know what they want. They know that having their own at the top is one of the best things to continue to happen to them. They know that Obasa is selfless and would always stand for them through thick and thin. He remains a course for study, not a subject of envy.\n\nOjole is the Senior Special Assistant on media to the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) has finally commenced the screening of its presidential aspirants seeking to fly the party\u2019s ticket during the 2023 general elections.\n\nHowever, journalists were barred from covering both the inauguration of the screening panel and the exercise proper which held at Transcorps Hilton Abuja.\n\nThe screening was earlier slated for May 23, 2022, but indefinitely postponed by the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nAbout 23 aspirants are jostling to pick the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nSome of the aspirants include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; former Minister of State for Education Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello; former Ogun state Governor Ibikunle Amosun; Ekiti state Governor Dr Kayode Fayemi and former Imo state Governor Rochas Okorocha currently in court for charges bordering on corruption.\n\nOthers are Senate President Ahmad Lawan; Ebonyi state Governor Dave Umahi; Jigawa state Governor Abubakar Badaru; Pastor Tunde Bakare; Cross River state Governor Ben Ayade; former Senate President Ken Nnamani; former Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi; former Minister of Science and Technology Dr Ogbonnaya Onu; former Zamfara state Governor Sani Yarima, former Minister of Information Ikeobasi Mokelu, Senator Ajayi Boroffice, Mr Nicholas Felix; former Speaker House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole; Tein Jack-Rich, Uju Ohanenye; the only female aspirant and a few others.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the seven-man screening panel led by the party\u2019s former national chairman, Chief John Oyegun asked all the aspirants screened Monday to express their commitment toward picking a consensus candidate by the party.\n\nA source told our correspondent that \u201csome of the aspirants were reluctant in committing themselves to the panel\u2019s demand on the issue of consensus, while some openly said they will abide by whatever decision taken by the party leadership.\u201d\n\nHowever, 12 out of the 23 aspirants screened Monday include Tinubu, Nwajuiba, Badaru, Boroffice, the only female aspirant, Uju Ken-Ohanenye, Felix Nicholas and Governor Umahi.\n\nOthers are former President of the Senate Nnamani, Bakare, Amosun, Yarima and Amaechi.\n\nI\u2019m ready to step down if\u2026 \u2013 Uju Ohanenye\n\nSpeaking to journalists after facing the screening panel, Mrs Uju Ohanenye, however said she would step down if the party asks her to do so as long as the party would be willing to carry on with her economic blueprints.\n\n\u201cI want you to realise that when family politically are asked like my party, APC to step down, I will not challenge the party because like they say, charity begins at home.\n\n\u201cI will never see it as a problem to my party because I am going to respect them. I am going to do whatever it takes to promote my party and make them relax so that they can make a better decision.\n\n\u201cSo, if their decision is to ask me to step down, I will not have choice than to step down so long as they can carry over my blueprints on board, definitely I will respect my party,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2026Party supreme \u2013 Tunde Bakare\n\nSimilarly, Pastor Bakare, who spoke to newsmen before he was screened said: \u201cThe party supremacy is the utmost essence. You cannot force your way through a party\u2019s structure. The party has the final say. And when we get to that bridge, we will know how to cross it.\n\n\u201cThe screening exercise is to check who is guilty and who is not. And it depends on the people who are doing the screening. By God\u2019s grace, we have complied with everything demanded for. We have supplied every information.\n\n\u201cAnd every information given is accurate and there is no miscommunication anywhere. Therefore, we will listen to what they have to say to us. And we trust God for accurate answers and deserving answers to all questions.\u201d\n\nAs at the time of filing this report at 8:20pm on Monday, the screening committee was attending to the former Lagos state Governor Tinubu, who was the last presidential aspirant to be screened on Monday while the exercise continues today (Tuesday).\n\nGaya\n\nMeanwhile, a lawmaker representing Kano South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Kabiru Gaya, has admonished President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the nation\u2019s mantle of leadership does not fall into the hand of a corrupt leader in 2023.\n\nHe also warned the APC that Osinbajo remains the party\u2019s best bet if it is to remain in power beyond the tenure of the present administration.\n\nGaya, chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP), the umbrella body of Osinbajo support groups, said this in an article Monday in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMore than just giving us free and fair elections is ensuring that moneybags and prebendal lords don\u2019t fly the party\u2019s flags in 2023. The collective fortunes of Nigerians which the Buhari-led administration has worked hard to build and protect in the last seven years must not go to the dogs.\n\n\u201cThis starts with whom he is going to be supporting in the build-up to the forthcoming party primaries.\n\nAs APC leader, he must ensure that he hands over the flag of the party to someone who imbibes his virtues of integrity, hard work, and patriotism and can sustain the party for the presidency.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari said during his interview with Channels TV in January that he will have to keep his preferred candidate secret because the person \u201cmay be eliminated if I mention. I better keep it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuhari knew what he was talking about when he made the statement to Seun Okinbaloye and Maupe Ogun-Yusuf of Channels TV during the interview. He knows he is surrounded by some desperate hawks who are desperate to spend any amount to get the APC ticket.\n\n\u201cWe recall when a certain then Governor was trying to outspend other presidential aspirants seeking the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2006, he got the shock of his life when his counterpart won the day. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\u201cMr President is using his influence to protect his legacy of integrity, anti-corruption, and hard work, his legacy will depend on who he supports for the APC ticket in 2023. The stakes are too high to cast his pearls before the swine.\n\n\u201cBut if you ask anyone from any region in Nigeria today it is common knowledge and in my opinion as well that Prof Yemi Osinbajo is the only candidate that can take on this huge assignment, he has the competence, the integrity, the trust of the people and the capacity to win, APC will lose the Presidential seat if any other candidate gets the ticket.\u201d\n\nHe also stressed the need for the president to ensure his legacy, particularly in the anti-corruption fight did not go in vain by ensuring a non-corrupt personality takes over from him in 2023.\n\n\u201cThis article is more concerned with what Buhari\u2019s legacy will depend on as he leaves office especially as internal source reveals that the biggest conversation around the very few who Mr President confides in had been the discuss about his legacy sorely dependent now on the quality and character of the person who he hands over the seat to.\n\n\u201cNigerians believe that President Muhammadu Buhari certainly will not fight corruption for 7years of his administration and then hand over Nigeria to corruption.\n\n\u201cI want to make the point that the only thing Mr President has to justify his hard work on the current major issues facing Nigeria is to hand over to a candidate that understands the complexity and continuity but more importantly the one is not coloured or perceived as a corrupt leader.\n\n\u201cThe President certainly is distancing himself from any such person and has answered how he wants to be remembered in my opinion, which will be largely dependent on who he will be supporting to succeed him in 2023!\u201d @ the TPP boss further stated.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By our correspondent\n\nNew Materials Nigeria Company, a building material company recently commissioned in the Kuje area of Abuja will save Nigeria a whopping sum of $100m in foreign exchange annually when fully operational, its Managing Director, Mr. Jackie Dai Hui has said.\n\nBriefing newsmen on the advantages of establishing the company in Nigeria, Mr. Jackie said it is estimated that when the company which produces Fiber Cement Board reaches its peak of about five million square meters annually; it would help the federal government save $100m in foreign exchange.\n\nHe explained that if the New Materials Nigeria Company succeeds, it will, within 10 years, invest in more companies and product lines especially in the area of production of Gypsum and Solar panels for alternative power generation.\n\nSpeaking further, the Managing Director said that so far, over $50 million has been invested in the New Materials Nigeria Company explaining that in no distant time, it will grow its investment in Nigeria by establishing a branch in Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of the New Materials Nigeria Company has gone a long way to provide employment to 150 Nigerians both at senior and junior levels who he said are also being trained in various skills.\n\n\u201cWe have management and junior staff. Our Human Resource Manager is Nigerian; our Office Manager is a Nigerian and our Shift Leader also is a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThese are top management positions. We train Nigerians to run the company; we are transferring technology to those who are brilliant. Today you may see some Chinese but next time you come you won\u2019t see Chinese, you will only see Nigerians here.\n\n\u201cWe want to share. Not like other foreign companies where all the top management staff are foreigners and Nigerians left to do the labour work. We have moved beyond that.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat Nigerians who have the desire to work with our company well and encourage them to build a career. We have administrators, we have technicians, we have general labour, we have managers and we have shift leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning, later we will give them more platforms, maybe one day when we have branches in Kano, ECOWAS countries like Cameroun; we can send Nigerians there to be Directors. This is what we do. We grow together for a shared future. Right now, we have up to 150 staff but less than 20 are Chinese, the others are Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo for this factory, we are not only like a factory or company, we are also like a university. We sum it as a work chance or skill platform for local persons. We can train people. In a year, we can train a number of people that would contribute to the building of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe can increase our company\u2019s presence in Nigeria because we can source all our raw materials in Nigeria. And also we can make analysis for Nigeria building material markets. So, this product is new material but it has more advantages and so we have confidence. At the end of this year I am sure we will see good results.\n\n\u201cLet me add that the first person to come to Nigeria from our company didn\u2019t know what Fiber Cement Board was, but now we all know and we all love the product. I have confidence in Nigeria. As Eric, the Deputy Managing Director said, we want to work with universities to do some research about our product. We can share the platform for people to learn more in Universities and Polytechnics; we can share knowledge\u201d, Mr. Jackie added.\n\nOn Corporate Social Responsibility, he said the company has built roads for the host communities, built boreholes to help them have access to clean water; and rehabilitated some schools and roofing sheets for some of their buildings.",

The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

The truth remains that people will throw up everything and anything. I am not particularly accepting that the process was monetized excessively, safe for those that can be proven.

The country is divided into six zones and we must not just think it is three zones of the South against the north. The emergence of Atiku has not affected Nigeria\u2019s unity, rather the burden of unity lies with APC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the strengthen of its candidate, Mr Sowunmi stated that Atiku Abubakar is a pan-Nigerian who will represent the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of their tribe or religion.\n\nThe governorship candidate, however cautioned cultural groups like PANDEF, Arewa Consultative Forum, Afenifere and others to steer clear of political matters and allow political parties manage its affairs. \u201d I have advised that PANDEF, Arewa, Afenifere and others need to be told not to jump into political matters as if they are political parties. They should not be seen usurping the powers of political parties.\u201d\n\nOn whether the party has the capacity to manage the fallout of the presidential primary, Mr Sowunmi noted that PDP will reach out to everybody and reconcile all groups, while nothing that there are no dissenting voices.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the party to present a candidate. If there is an equity challenge, nobody should address that to PDP rather the APC, because it has only produced its president from the northwest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that politics is not for the lily-livered. What happened at the primary is that delegates voted for a unifier.\n\nOn zoning, Mr Sowunmi said \u201cI have maintained consistently that the place of birth is just an accident of history that no one can repair. The only equity challenge that we have is the Southeast because the region has not been able to produce president.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the political gladiators from the other side will always wish that only crises will exits from the camp of their rivals, but hello, you can go to the bank with this, the political process from \u2018tomorrow\u2019 will show that PDP is a big party. We\u2019ll hug ourselves and unite one another\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that your darling party is back, we have given you a darling candidate that you know well, Even with the congratulatory message from Asiwaju, it shows that he knows the worth of Atiku.

          "text": "A former Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye has expressed satisfaction with the conduct and outcome of the 2022 Presidential primary of the People\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nThe former lawmaker stated this on Monday while featuring on TVC\u2019s current affairs program, Journalists\u2019 Hangout.\n\nMr Melaye equally expressed his confidence in the party\u2019s ability to wrestle power from the APC government in 2023.\n\nAccording to him, the convention produced the best candidate to fly the party\u2019s flag in a free and fair contest that every participant is proud of.\n\nSpeaking about his defeat at the party\u2019s senatorial primary, the former lawmaker said all that happened at the election has become history and doesn\u2019t want to discuss it again. \u201cI have moved on. All that happened in the Senate rerun have become history. I really don\u2019t what to dwell on the past. That primary has gone and I have moved on.\u201d\n\nMr Melaye also spoke about his performance while serving as Kogi West senator. \u201cAs a Senator, in terms of representation, I did my best because I implemented so many projects. In the history of National Assembly, I have the highest number of bills. The records are there, they are incontrovertible. I did my best for my people.\u201d\n\nReacting to question about his switch of support from the former Senator President, Bukola Saraki to former Vice Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, the former lawmaker made it clear that he never switched support. He explained that he supported Saraki 100% while he was with him. \u201c I did not switch support from Saraki to Atiku. I was 100% with Saraki when I was with him. I have no problem with Saraki, I still saw him this morning and we both laughed together.\n\n\u201cI chose Atiku time because I have to stay with the known to the unknown. At this time, we need a unifier, who can unite Nigeria. One who cannot be seen as a Muslim, or Christian. Atiku is a popular person whose name is known every in Nigeria. So I moved from unknown to known. So, I did not switch support but support the man who can make Nigeria great.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Melaye dismissed the rumour that Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal betrayed his colleague and fellow aspirant, Nyesom Wike when the former announced his withdrawer from the contest and directed his delegates to vote Atiku Abubakar. He said governor Tambuwal did not betray Mr Wike as there was no written agreement between the two of them. He added that both former aspirants worked independently in pursuit of their ambition. He equally dismissed the insinuation that there was a gang up by some northern elites against the South.\n\n\u201cGovernor Tambuwal saw the necessity to elect a candidate that can unite Nigeria because our dear nation needs a father figure who can unite everyone. Someone who will be able to unite Nigeria and that person is Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Atiku is sound and healthy, politically sagacious and intellectually sound. Atiku will not fail, he will win with landslide. Whatever APC is going to do in terms of manipulation, Atiku is the next president of Nigeria. Our convention has shown that we are more united that ever. We are on big family,\u201d Melaye said.\n\nThe Kogi-born former lawmaker who also spoke on the economy, said it is obvious to everyone that Nigeria is in serious economic distress as prices of goods and services increase alarmingly everyday. According to him, the prices of common goods such as bread, rice, air ticket among others are increasing almost everyday, thereby making life more difficult for Nigerians. \u201cNigerians have engaged both APC and PDP and they know the difference. So, I am confident Nigerians will vote PDP in 2023.\u201d\n\nEconomically, everything has risen such that cost of living has gone up astronomically.\u201d\n\nOn the fight against corruption, Mr Melaye said in the history of Nigeria, there\u2019s no government that is as corrupt as the present Buhari administration. He alleged that people loot brazenly under Buhari administration without consequence. \u201d It is a known fact that tis government is corrupt, people are looting without limitation. Look at the case of the suspended accountant general of the federation who is accused of stealing more than N80bn. There cannot be such thing under Atiku Administration.\u201d\n\nDefection\n\nSenator Dino Melaye argued that most of the governors who defected from PDP to APC are in their second term. He queried why those governors didn\u2019t do so in their first term in office.\n\n\u201d Those defecting from PDP to APC are doing so to protect themselves because they know once they cross to the party, their sins are forgiven. But I can tell you for sure that APC cannot win counsellorship election in a free fair and credible elections in Nigeria again.\u201d\n\nMr Melaye who boasted that PDP is now one big and united family, said all aggrieved parties will be brought back under one big umbrella because Atiku is a father figure. \u201d Atiku is matured, he will unite Nigerians. Everyone will have a bite of national cake. Everybody will benefit from Atiku\u2019s government not only those in his campaign. He urged Nigerians to come out and vote Atiku in order to bring Nigeria back to the path of development.\u201d\n\nWike vs Atiku\n\nReacting to the insinuations that governor Wike will not give total support to Atiku Abubakar\u2019s ambition, Mr Melaye said he believes Mr Wike is a man of his words who has promised to support whoever emerged candidate of the party.\n\nGovernor Wike says what he meant and mean what he says. I believe he will support his party because he\u2019s a party man. I appeal to journalists not to sow seed of discord in our party. By the grace of God, success awaits us in 2023.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged supremacy battle between North and South at the presidential primary, Mr Melaye accused APC of spreading such fake news. He said contrary to opinions of many, Kano and Katsina voted for Governor Wike while Delta voted for Atiku. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like North versus South in this contest, it\u2019s just the creation of APC. There was no tribal war, the delegates voted according to their conscience.\u201d\n\nOn the strength of his party and its candidate, the former lawmaker said \u201d the least of PDP aspirant will defeat all aspirants in APC. We are not afraid of any aspirants. Both the president and other aspirants on the platform of APC will be defeated by Atiku. He touted Mr Kolade-Otitoju to swear with Bible that PDP did not win the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhere in a peculiar time in our history where we have to choose between winning and zoning. We have decided to acquire power before sharing power. So we decided to throw it open to acquire power before sharing power,\u201d Mr Melaye said while reacting to the choice of a northern candidate.\n\nSenator Melaye said former vice president Atiku Abubakar is a strong and mature candidate who is competent enough to deliver on his cardinal objectives which include unity of purpose, security, State building and nation building, devolution of power, economy and restructuring.",

At one point, U.S. crude rose to $119.42 per barrel \u2014 a 12-week high, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nContracts for August also traded higher: WTI crude rose 3.21% to $115.83, and Brent was up 1.63% to $119.53 per barrel.\n\nThe agreement resolves a deadlock after Hungary initially held up talks. Hungary is a major user of Russian oil and its leader, Viktor Orban, has been on friendly terms with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\n\nCharles Michel, president of the European Council, said the move would immediately hit 75% of Russian oil imports.\n\nThe sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports. And by the end of the year, 90% of the Russian oil imported in Europe will be banned.\n\nThe embargo is part of the European Union\u2019s sixth sanctions package on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

So this is a topic where we will come back to and where we will still have to work on, but this is a big step forward, what we did today,\u201d she said, referring to the temporary exemption.\n\nVon der Leyen explained that the temporary exemption was granted so that Hungary, along with Slovakia and the Czech Republic \u2014 all connected to the southern leg of the pipeline \u2014 have access which they cannot easily replace.\n\nRoughly 36% of the EU\u2019s oil imports come from Russia, a country that plays an outsized role in global oil markets.",

          "text": "In its first official reaction to the adjustment of the general election guidelines, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Monday, said it did not act unilaterally or out of sync in adjusting the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election by a few days.\n\nThe commission also took a swipe at the PDP, which has cancelled all its primary elections in Ebonyi State, saying, \u201cSome of the political parties that criticised the commission despite being part of the pleas for a little adjustment are now taking advantage of and seizing the opportunity of the 6 days grace period or window they criticised to put their house in order by conducting their outstanding primaries.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the national commissioner in charge of Information and Chairman, Voter Education, Festus Okoye, said, \u201cThe Commission understands the mood of the nation and assures Nigerians that going forward, it is determined to follow through with its timelines embedded in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is focused and determined to conduct free, fair and transparent election in 2023,\u201d Okoye added.\n\nAccording to him, the commission was resolute and would not in any way tamper with the critical timelines in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities, adding: \u201cThe Commission did not act unilaterally or under any form of pressure or duress in the 6-day grace period granted to the 18 registered political parties.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that on May 10, 2022, the Commission held a consultative meeting with the leaders of all the 18 registered Political Parties. At the meeting, the political parties requested for an adjustment of the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThey requested for 60 days and the Commission turned it down. Thereafter, the political parties requested for a shift of 37 days and the commission turned it down.\n\n\u201cAt the consultative meeting, where the parties made the request, some of them accused the Commission of endangering democracy by refusing to alter the Timetable and Schedule of Activities. They insisted that they may not have candidates in so many of the constituencies unless they are given a grace period.\n\n\u201cOf course, the period for the primaries had started as at the time the political parties unanimously made the request. By the Timetable and Schedule of Activities, the period for the primaries commenced on the 4th of April 2022 and to end on the 3rd of June 2022. None of the Political Parties accused the Commission of shifting the goal post at the middle of the game.\n\n\u201cOn the 12th of May 2022, the political parties wrote to the Commission once again requesting for an adjustment of the timelines and the Commission turned down their request. None of the political parties accused IPAC of acting unilaterally or not representing them.\n\n\u201cOn the 26th of May 2022, the political parties under the auspices of the Inter Party Advisory Council, wrote to the Commission and requested for a meeting to hold on the 27th day of May 2022. IPAC invited their members to the meeting. 15 of the registered Political Parties attended the meeting.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting of the 27th May 2022, they informed the Commission that they used their own network to invite all the registered political parties. They once again requested for an adjustment of the timelines on grounds that they have problems.\n\n\u201cThey pleaded and canvassed that the Electoral Act 2022 was being operated for the first time and that most of them have made mistakes in the conduct of their primaries. They pleaded with the Commission to show some magnanimity to enable them have crisis-free primaries and avoid avoidable litigation,\u201d the INEC national commissioner stated.\n\nHe explained that instead of 37 to 60 days, the political parties pleaded for only six days between the 3rd June and the commencement of the upload of nomination forms on our web portal on 10th June 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not true and cannot by any stretch of imagination be insinuated that the commission bowed to pressure. The commission granted a request and headed the plea by all the political parties in Nigeria to use the six days already provided in the Timetable of which all the parties were aware of.\n\n\u201cA passionate plea by political parties for what they called a little adjustment cannot by any stretch of imagination be termed bowing to pressure. Furthermore, the six days grace period extended to the political parties will not in any way affect any of the timelines in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities of the Commission.\n\n\u201cThere is no longer any window to play with or any little adjustment to be made. Political parties may find out to their disappointment that they may have no candidates in constituencies, where they are unable to conduct or conclude their congresses and democratic primaries as provided by the Electoral Act 2020. We remind all Political Parties of what happened in some States (Rivers and Zamfara) in 2019,\u201d Okoye said.",
