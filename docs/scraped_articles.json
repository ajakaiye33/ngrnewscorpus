          "text": "\u2026seek global support against Christians\u2019 killings in North\n\nChurches in Abuja, Kaduna, Benue, Plateau and Osun States among others on Sunday defied state governments\u2019 ban on rallies to protest the recent killing of Deborah Yakubu, a 200 Level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto, by Muslim fundamentalists.\n\nThe protesters condemned jungle justice and sought global support against Christians\u2019 killings in the North.\n\nDuring the protest, the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev Samson Ayokunle, sought justice for victims of religious intolerance across the country, including Samuel.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the CAN had called for a nationwide protest over Samuel\u2019s killing.\n\nJoining a protest in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, and addressing journalists, the CAN President, on the sidelines in the premises of Oritamefa Baptist Church, Ibadan, said, \u201cThe reason we are here is to unanimously, as Christians, say no to jungle justice and wanton killing of the innocent as if Nigeria were the Banana Republic.\n\n\u201cWe are saying that Nigeria is a law-guided society. And for everything, whether religious or not religious, the Constitution of Nigeria is supreme. The constitution must be brought to bear upon every conduct of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, no religious group should be allowed to take laws into its own hands. There must be justice for those whose lives are unduly terminated and whose dreams are perished.\u201d\n\nMembers of CAN Oyo State chapter also gathered at the association\u2019s secretariat in Ibadan to register their displeasure about the killing.\n\nMembers of The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Central Parish, after the Sunday service at the Wuse 2 area of Abuja, led by the Regional Pastor who refused to give his name to journalists, also protested with their mouths sealed with cello tape.\n\nAnother Pastor of the Church said the decision not to speak at the protest was an \u201corder from above.\u201d\n\nThere is compliance to the President of CAN\u2019s order, urging church leaders to use placards and demonstrate within the premises of their local churches or CAN secretariats.\n\nMembers of the Plateau State chapter of CAN trooped out en masse around 3pm with placards at its secretariat along Jos-Abuja road under the rains, calling on the government to sto pextra-judicial killings in the country.\n\nAlso, Christians under the aegis of CAN gathered at the NKST Church premises at Idye, along Gboko road, Makurdi, to protest Deborah\u2019s death.\n\nThe Benue State CAN chairman, Rev. Akpen Leva, said, \u2018Enough is enough of the killing of Christians in Nigeria\u2019, adding that Christians were not second-class citizens in Nigeria, and the church would no longer tolerate it.\n\nThe cleric wondered why some religious extremists\u2019 arrests degenerated into the tension that led to the violent protest that destroyed worship centres in Sokoto and other parts of the country and insisted that Christians cannot continue to bury their loved ones in the name of religion.\n\nIn Osun State, CAN members held a peaceful protest at the association\u2019s secretariat. Addressing the protesters, Osun CAN chairman, Bishop Amos Ogunrinde, declared that the killing of Deborah was barbaric and ungodly.\n\nSimilarly, members of the RCCG, Osun Province 10 in Osogbo, staged a protest in compliance with the directive of the RCCG leadership.\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH during the protest, which was held at the Liberation Cathedral, Pastor Felix Afe-Johnson, said, \u201cWe do not support bloodshed and all manner of vices going on in the country. We will prevent reoccurrence when everyone keeps to his or her religion.\u201d\n\nAlso in Kaduna, Christians gathered at the Evangelical Church of Winning All, Sabon-Tasha, to intercede for the country.\n\nThe state Vice-Chairman of CAN, Rev. Chris Annger, said, \u201cWe are here to first pray for the survival of those alive and let the world know that it\u2019s not the best way to go by killing because we live in a country where there are rules as the constitution. As patriotic Nigerians, we have what is guiding us that has to be respected.\u201d\n\nChristians in Bayelsa State also staged a peaceful protest, under the auspices of CAN, as they marched from the St. Matthias Catholic Church in the Amarata area of Yenagoa to the Peace Park, opposite the Government House in the state capital.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Senator Ibikunle Amosun\n\nBy Benjamin O.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Senator Ibikunle Amosun cuts a figure of stoic realism when he speaks of the age-long challenges facing the nation and how he intends to create a Nigeria where young people are equipped for the future and Nigeria is equipped for the next generation of young people.\n\nIt seems one important advantage that has been thrown up from the emergence of the kaleidoscope of candidates in the current political dispensation is that we are now well and truly entering the realm of intellectualism; a season of ideas and the contestation of world views and perspectives, a scenario that potentially transitions Nigeria into a new and better vista of leadership culture.\n\nThat Senator Amosun and President Muhammadu Buhari share a close, some would say, father and son-like personal relationship built on trust and mutual respect over many years, is not a secret. But what is striking, especially for a Nigeria politician, is the fact that the former Governor of Ogun State prefers to remain circumspect in touting this relationship as many Nigerian politicians would be wont to do.\n\nRather he believes a contest based on the strength of ideas rather than ideas of \u201cwho is strong\u201d will augur better for the long term prospects of the All Progressives Congress and the Nigerian state as a whole.\n\nDespite this quiet disposition, many political watchers attest to the fact that Senator Amosun was and continues to be an important intercessor between the Presidency and the current national assembly. It is also believed that he has been instrumental in helping the President pass his agenda through the hallowed chambers in this his second term by shrewdly cultivating bi-partisan support.\n\nSenator Amosun\u2019s ideas as captured in his manifesto, on furthering the cause and development indices of the Nigerian state are worthy of interrogation as they seem to present a case for growing a new kind of economy on the back of the bountiful human capital Nigeria is blessed with.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur fossil fuels resource is not our greatest resource, as important as it is, its value varies and fluctuates with the time and vagaries of human behavior. Take for example from the period of Covid to the current Ukraine-Russian war, we can see the extremes in pricing and the effects on the global economy and that of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur sole reliance on this kind of resource may not be the best approach even as the world potentially transitions to a post-oil economy. I believe grounding and tethering our economy upon a well-trained manpower resource for which our country is greatly blessed will pay us greater dividends in the long term. It will potentially expand our capacity into becoming the biggest trade market in Africa\u201d.\n\nAt his recent May 5th Presidential declaration, Senator Amosun, whilst providing the broad outlines of his manifesto, identified two important pillars upon which he intends to build out his national development architecture, which are national security and integrated economic development.\n\nImportant subheads like healthcare, education, agriculture and food security, infrastructural rural and urban development, technology, innovation and an incremental digital economy plan, seem to naturally flow from the overarching national architecture philosophy he outlined in the document.\n\nHis national security strategy involves a grassroots community policing and national internal security plan that extends outwardly and into regional security policy that takes the fight to Nigeria\u2019s enemies whether foreign or domestic.\n\nIt also suggests a build-out and expansion of Nigeria\u2019s Military-industrial complex, focusing strongly on threat readiness and a proactive response capability to physical and virtual(cyber) threats; all seemingly bold and ambitious plans that testify to the importance of right-sizing leadership to take on the demands of an ever-evolving litigious world order.\n\nTestimonials about Senator Amosun\u2019s large-heartedness and sense of duty abound, notably from a host of distinguished Nigerians who provide warm testimony to the potential of an Ibikunle Amosun presidency.\n\nLittle wonder his declaration was attended by many of his colleagues from the two chambers of the national assembly and indeed one who he fondly refers to as a brother governor in Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State who is himself a fellow presidential aspirant for the exalted ticket of the APC.\n\nSenator Amosun, himself a two-time former Governor of Ogun State, elected on the platform of the ruling APC is today the ranking senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly. And suffice to say, an encounter with him enshrouds the quiet confidence of a man for whom the stars are seemingly aligning.\n\nRather, he prefers to advocate and flaunt his competence and wealth of experience in both the public and private sectors as his shield and armor that have propelled him to the top of the pecking order of candidates advantageously placed to take on the mantle of leadership after the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari bows out in 2023.\n\nSenator Ibikunle Amosun, the man who would be President, was born on 25 January 1958 and had his primary education at the African Church Primary school in Abeokuta between 1965 and1970. Thereafter he went to the African Church Grammar school, between 1971\u20131977 subsequently attending the Ogun State Polytechnic, where he graduated with a Higher National Diploma (HND) in 1983.\n\nHe started his professional career as an audit trainee with the Chartered Accounting firm of Lanre Aremu & Co. sometime in 1984 and later joined XtraEdge Consulting as a managing consultant. By 1990, he had ventured into private practice by establishing the firm of Ibikunle Amosun & Co. a firm of Chartered Accountants where he acted as Principal partner.\n\nHe attained Associate membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) in 1990 and became a fellow of the Institute in 1996. He also became an Associate Member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria in 1998 as he sought to expand the scope of his knowledge and application of the actuarial sciences in the Nigerian market.\n\nIn furthering his quest for learning and professional refinement, Senator Amosun attended the University of Westminster in London, United Kingdom, where he acquired a Masters in International Finance in the year 2000.\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria, specifically around April 2003, Senator Amosun was for the first time, elected to the senate to represent the good people of Ogun Central Senatorial district.\n\nHe served meritoriously until the year 2011 when he became the Gubernatorial candidate of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) for the April 2011 election which he won and thereafter served as a two-term governor of the \u201cGateway State\u201d.\n\nBenjamin wrote in from Lagos\n\nVanguard News",

Justice Mudashiru Oniyangi, held at the Ilorin Golf Club.\n\nAnswering a question on the state of the nation under both democratic and military rules, the civil war veteran said Nigeria neither experienced good leadership under the military rule nor respite during the democratic era.\n\nHe lamented the horrendous state the country was in now amidst its problems of insecurity and corruption, describing it as \u201cresult of the cumulative failures of both the military and democratic leaders that have administered the country since its independence.\n\n\u201cHave we had true democracy or have we had true military government?

          "text": "Members of the Rivers chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Sunday trooped to the streets of Port Harcourt to protest the killing of the 22-year-old Deborah Samuel in Sokoto State.\n\nThe Assistant Secretary, CAN, John Odinichi, who led the protest on behalf of the state Chairman, said it was in obedience to the directives of the national body.\n\nOdinichi appealed to other Governors in the North to imitate Governor Nyesom Wike, who he said had provided peaceful coexistence for all religious groups in the State.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere has not been no incident of religious crisis in Rivers State. If It can be done in Rivers state and other Niger Delta states, it can also be done in the North.\n\n\u201cIt is a Biblical injunction that we rejoice with those who are rejoicing and mourn with those who mourn. We have come to register our displeasure to the babaric act that led to the death of our late sister.\n\n\u201cWe are saying as Christian Association of Nigeria, Rivers State chapter that enough is enough. Each time killings like this happen they give us flimsy excuses. Islam is not a violent religion yet they kill christians at the slightest provocation.\n\n\u201cAs religious scholars there is no religion that encourages violence. In The Nigerian Constitution it is enshrined, the freedom of association,worship and religion. Why should another religion stop the freedom of another religion? This is our worry.\n\n\u201cWe say that Christians in Nigeria cannot subscribe to be second class citizens in our country. We are Nigerians by birth. We are not adopted. We are sending this message to our Muslim brothers, that they should please advise their adherents\u201d.\n\nOdinichi asked Islamic authorities to check the scholars preaching violence to their followers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe golden law says whatever you wish to be done to you, you should also do to others. In other words what you don\u2019t want others to do to you don\u2019t do it to them.\n\n\u201cAs humans, we all have violence in us. Our Christian religion has taught us that we should follow the path of peace and we have been maintaining peace in this country.\n\n\u201cWe want muslims in particular to follow the path of peace. Islam is not the only religion in this country. We have the African Traditional Religion, pagans, atheist and others.\n\n\u201cThe African Traditional Religion in which many of us emerged from being converted to islam or christianity has no record where the advent of african traditional religion rose to kill anybody or victimize anyone for leaving their religion.\n\n\u201cWe criticise, condemn the activities of African religion, none has carried sword to slaughter anyone both muslim or christian.\n\nThey should practise their religion in a decent orderly manner\u201d.",

          "text": "By Our Correspondents\n\nThe succession battle between governors and major stakeholders in their states has intensified as the ruling party, All Progressives Congress(APC) and the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) hold their governorship and House of Assembly primaries this week.\n\nWhile that of the PDP will hold on May 25, the APC has rescheduled its governorship primary for May 27.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nPower brokers in the two major parties will this week go for broke as they battle to outwit each other in the selection of their governorship candidates.\n\nIn some states, the sitting governors have anointed their likely successors while in others, the race is still open to all the aspirants. From one state to the other, the battle for succession is raging.\n\nKano: It\u2019s grudge war\n\nBreaking!!! Earn up to N2 - N3 million monthly GUARANTEED (all paid in US Dollars).

Excitement, intrigues, betrayal, alignment and even defection among others are some of the highlights of this political frenzy.\n\nUnlike in the past, when the race was essentially a tug of war between the two leading political parties, APC and PDP, the present contest has a new entrant, New Nigerian Peoples Party(NNPP) led by Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and strengthened by the recent defection of Senator Ibrahim Shekarau to its platform.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nBut just like in the past, the 2023 poll would be a continuation of the grudge- war between Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, the two indefatigable giants of modern Kano.\n\nIt is an open secret that both men had sworn to politically undo each other with either of them pledging to retire the other from politics. Even at the best of times and in the bliss of friendship, the two gladiators have subtly battled each other over the control of the state, either by presenting themselves in the ring or by nurturing and nominating their trusted proxies to fight on.\n\nAnalysts believe that what is emerging as the final list for the position of the governor is nothing but the godsons and anointed proxies of the two strongest political forces in the state.\n\nFrom the trenches of the APC is the Nasiru Gawana as the governorship aspirant and Murtala Sule Garo as his running mate. They were unveiled to the members of the party at a recent stakeholders meeting held at the Government House, Kano.\n\nThe two gladiators have a rich political history, especially under the present political dispensation. Gawanu and Garo, it is not forgotten, were prime actors in the famous controversy at Gawuna ward that stalled the elections. This impasse eventually led to the suspension of the process and formed the basis for INECs declaration of the governorship poll in the state as inconclusive.\n\nPrior to his appointment as the State deputy governor, Gawuna had served as a Local Government Chairman under Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, Commissioner for Agriculture under Rabiu Kwankwaso and Commissioner for Agriculture under Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.\n\nOn his part, Garo was a product of the Kwankwaso years as governor of the state. An in- law to Atiku Abubakar and with a lot of grassroots followership, he was the state Commissioner of Local Government and one of the most trusted and able lieutenants of the Ganduje administration.\n\nIn the aftermath of the governor\u2019s anointment, many of the aspirants within the APC had laid down their dreams or had moved on from there.\n\nSome of them, like the former Speaker of the House and current Reps member for Rano and Bukure constituency, Kabiru Alhassan Rirum, elected to defect to the NNPP.\n\nThe likes of Barrister Inuwa Waya remained in the party to struggle on; A.A Zaura stepped down his dream and settled for Kano Central Senate seat while Senator Barau Jilbrin returned to the quest for the senate seat for Kano North.\n\nIn the NNPP, a list of consensus arrangement for various topmost positions appeared in the media a few days ago. From that document, Abba Kabiru Yusuf, a relative of Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, emerged as the flag bearer of the party for the governorship post. Abba, who has stayed away from public light ever since his impressive performance in the 2019 elections, is to be deputized by Aminu Abdulsalam, a former Chief of Staff to Kwankwaso and seasoned politician.\n\nBoth of them, it must be recalled, made history when they emerged as the winner of the first round of the gubernatorial election in the state. They were eventually defeated at the second round of the exercise by the incumbent.\n\nFrom the PDP in the state, the list of aspirants is impressive. They include known faces like multi- millionaire business man, Ibrahim Amin Little, son of former Nigeria Head of State, Mohammad Abacha, son of former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sadiq Wali, former Chief of Staff to Kwankwaso, Dr Abubakar Goni, and the former Chairman of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti Corruption Agency, Buyi Magaji.\n\nOthers are the former Commissioner of Budget in the state, Yusuf Dambatta, Mustapha Bala Getso and a former Commissioner of Work, Mauzu Magaji as well as Jafar Sani Bello. Bello told Daily Sun by phone that he is very optimistic he would pick the ticket of the party, adding he and his team had worked very hard to emerge victorious.\n\nDaily Sun reports that a number of litigations between the current State Executive led by Shehu Shagagi and the Aminu Wali faction of the party have shrouded the activities of the party, reducing its impact as an alternate political party in the state.\n\nBut there is hope that as soon as they are done with their litigations, the party would rise up to its challenges and be counted.\n\nFrom the Peoples Redemption Party is the son of Tanko Yakasai, Salihu Tanko Yakassai. He was removed from office for siding the Nigeria masses against Buhari, and has remained very popular.\n\nEnugu: The mind game\n\nNo fewer than 20 persons are jostling to replace Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State by May 29, next year, in the three major political parties of PDP, APC and APGA.\n\nSixteen of this number are from the PDP and they include, former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, Prof Bart Nnaji, Chijioke Edeoga, Peter Mbah, Senator Gil Nnaji, Capt. Evarest Nnaji, Rev. Ifeanyi Nwoye, Chinyeaka Ohaa, and Dr. Gabriel Ajah.\n\nOthers are Dr. Kingsley Udeh, Pastor Beloved-Dan Anike, Nwabueze Ugwu, Dr Josef Onoh, Erasmus Anike, Prof. Jehu Nnaji and Chukwudi Nneji.\n\nIn APGA are former Minister of Information, Frank Nweke (Jnr.), Jeff Nnamani and Donatus Uzoemena, while the APC has Chief Uche Nnaji as the only visible aspirant.\n\nThree major factors would determine who succeeds Ugwuanyi at the end of the day; namely: influence of zoning principle; how the Isi-Uzo matter is handled and the eventual fate of the clamour for South East Presidency.\n\nBarring any changes in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) timetable, all these issues must be settled in less than 10 days.\n\nThere have been campaigns that there is governorship zoning arrangement in the state and that it is the turn of Enugu East Senatorial District. Interest groups have invested substantially in pushing this agenda including hosting campaigns. Yet, within this group also exist those who lobby that there should be micro zoning to either Nkanu East or Isi-Uzo Local Government Area citing backwardness in the case of the former.\n\nBut another formidable group led by the senator representing Enugu West, Ekweremadu insists that the governorship slot having gone round the three zones should now be open for grabs. For them, what matters most at this period is competency; the capacity of the aspirant to deliver.\n\nIn the midst of all these, there has also been contention over the three-man delegates list of the party. Both camps have instituted law suits regarding what the authentic delegates\u2019 list should be. This has further opened flanks for squabbles within the party.\n\nGovernor Ugwuanyi has not spoken publicly on where he stands on the unfolding scenarios including naming his preferred aspirant. His has been a clear case of \u2018hide and seek,\u2019 though it is open secret that he totally supports zoning the slot to Enugu East. He attended different rallies to shore up support for zoning the governorship there.\n\nAs it stands, virtually all the aspirants are jostling to get the governor\u2019s endorsement. But, the popular thinking in Enugu is that the immediate past Commissioner for Environment, Chijioke Edeoga, who hails from Isi-Uzo has the backing of the governor.\n\nEdeoga, a former member of the House of Representatives has continued to power in a manner that not a few see him as the anointed one. The only snag for him is that people are seeing him as an extension of Nsukka cultural bloc where Ugwuanyi belongs.\n\nThe fear is that the core Nkanu people in Enugu East Senatorial District may work against him in the election proper if he eventually grabs the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nIn that situation, they may support any of their own that emerges from either APGA or APC. There is also the feeling that Ekweremadu may toe the same path in the event that he is denied the PDP ticket.\n\nThe foregoing scenario has further compounded PDP\u2019s headache in Enugu State.\n\nAnother important factor is that the outcomes of the PDP and APC Presidential conventions relating to the South East would determine the direction of the governorship race in the zone. So, voters in the zone will naturally vote for any party that gives presidential ticket to somebody from the region, and Enugu would not be different.\n\nMeanwhile, 15 PDP governorship aspirants from Enugu East Senatorial District, Saturday, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accept, without hesitation, any one among them whom the governor chooses to become the candidate of the party.\n\nIt was only Prof. Hillary Edeoga that failed to produce himself for the meeting where the undertaking was entered into before the Enugu East Traditional Rulers Council led by its Chairman, Igwe Julius Nnaji, the Odezuluigbo II of Nike.\n\nIn the MoU, the aspirants also agreed not to drag the fallout of Ugwuanyi\u2019s choice and the primary election to any court of law, agreeing also, that those not favoured by the choice would be carried along in the new government to be formed in 2023.\n\nThey said they were committed to \u201cA compromise on matters that will promote unity, law, and order during the campaign and election period; respect for the governor of Enugu State and acceptance of his choice of a candidate from this group in the best interests of the Enugu\u2013East Senatorial Zone and Enugu State at large.\n\nThe MoU was prepared under the auspices, guidance, and direction of the Traditional Rulers Council of the Enugu\u2013East Senatorial District and the PDP Zonal Chairman, Enugu-East Senatorial District, Chief Nnamdi Nwafor and adopted at the Nike Lake Resort Hotel in Enugu.\n\nTaraba: Religion and zoning as major factors\n\nIn Taraba, several intrigues and permutations have continued to play out in the hustle for the governorship seat with alleged outright imposition of candidates and substitution of delegate list in some political parties.\n\nApart from that, religion and zoning remain some of the topical issues that would decide the fate of the aspirants.\n\nThe PDP has enjoyed uninterrupted rule of Taraba since the return to democracy in 1999, producing all the governors so far and most of the legislative positions both at the state and federal levels.\n\nDuring the 2015 and 2019 general elections, the candidate of the APC gave a hard run to the party but the party still held sway ultimately. This was partly due to the high regards they had for the zoning arrangement that saw the first governor from the Northern Zone between 1999 and 2003, Central Zone between 2007 and 2015 and Southern Taraba from 2015 to date.\n\nHowever, as the preparations for the 2023 general elections gather momentum, the party seems to be in disarray as the zoning arrangement seems to have been relegated to the background.\n\nFollowing the zoning arrangement, the governorship position is supposed to return to the Northern Zone in 2023. However, while the governor is said to be in full support of the arrangement, some interests in the South have insisted that the seat must remain in the zone for the next eight years.\n\nAccording to Alhaji Abdulrazaq Musa, the pioneer Chairman of PDP in the state who is also the leader of PDP elders forum from Northern Zone, the move by some interests to set aside the zoning arrangement could spell doom for the party.\n\nHowever, only recently, an elder statesman was alleged to have stirred the anger of the party members in his bid to impose a candidate from the Southern Zone who is very unpopular in the state.\n\nWhile about five aspirants from the Northern Zone have picked the forms and have been screened by the party, two other aspirants front the South have also been screened and cleared to contest.\n\nAmong the top aspirants in the northern zone are the Speaker of the state Assembly, Professor Joseph Albasu Kunini, former PDP Chairman in the state, Victor Bala Kona, former Accountant General of the state, Ayuba Aminu Kotolo, Dr Hilkia Buba Joda and Professor Jerome Nyame. In the South, Mr Damian Dodo (SAN) and Senator Joel Ikyenya also picked the forms and have been cleared to vie for the ticket of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC in the state is also relentless in her bid to take over the state in 2023.\n\nThe state Chairman of the party Alhaji Ibrahim Tukur El-Sudi told Journalists recently that the ruling PDP in the state has done all the campaign for the APC through the gross underperformance of the present administration in the state and expressed optimism that the party will win the state unfailingly in 2023.\n\nThe party has also enjoyed influx of high profile persons from the PDP recently including the former Senate Deputy Minority leader, Emmanuel Bwacha, former speakers of the state House of Assembly, Mr Abel Diah and Dr. Mark Useni among others.\n\nHowever, a clash of interests among the old and new comers is threatening to tear the party apart. Only recently, the party Chairman announced and inaugurated a new set of officials for four local government areas in the Southern zone of the state in a move many believe was intended to alter the political calculations in favour of a certain new comer and aspirant in the party. So far, the move is met with still opposition and litigations.\n\nWhile the party maintains that the zoning arrangement is a creation of the PDP and has nothing to do with the APC, most people believe that religion will okay a central role in deciding the fate of the party.\n\nIn the two governorship elections that the party has participated in so far in the state, most people believe that the party failed to make headways because they fielded candidates who are Muslims, giving credence to the notion that the APC is a religious or Muslim party.\n\nFor most analysts, \u201cthe APC stands a very good chance of clinching the governorship seat of the state if they are fair enough to allow a Christian fly their flag, rather than insisting on a Muslim\u201d.\n\nTaraba is a predominantly Christian state with a good Muslim population. In recent times, however, the Muslim Council raised the alarm over what they considered as marginalisation of Muslims in the state by the state government.\n\nMeanwhile, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the NNPP, and other political parties are also on standby, deliberately delaying their primaries to create room for those who may feel aggrieved with the outcome of their respective party primaries and may decide to defect to other options.\n\nWhile the issues of zoning, religion, litigations and imposition of candidates continue to play strategic roles in the clamour for who succeeds Governor Darius Ishaku in 2023, insecurity and poverty are a major concern for the people.\n\nRecent security challenges in the state occasioned by bomb blasts, rise in thuggery and street violence especially at political gatherings are a major cause for alarm for the people.\n\nWhether the political parties and political bigwigs will be willing to play the game by the rules, allow delegates to chose the right candidates and rally support for whoever emerges for each party, or whether the process of primaries will lead to the crash of some political parties and the rise of others remains to be seen in the days ahead. For now, one thing that is obvious is that the political calculations in Taraba as regards the governorship tussle remain a mirage.\n\nCross River: Consensus collapses\n\nIn Cross River, the consensus option initially envisaged has collapsed as the APC, PDP governorship aspirants head for primaries.\n\nA few days away from the exercise, the two major parties in the state are working round the clock to manoeuvre the political space for the governorship victory in 2023.\n\nBefore now, the discordant tunes over zoning and consensus were the trending campaign issues but all that seem to have collapsed ahead of the governorship primaries.\n\nThe APC in the state took the bull by the horns on May 10, 2022 when it announced Sen. Bassey Otu as the consensus governorship aspirant. Sen Ot\u00f9, seen by many party stalwarts as a game changer, was a former Senator representing southern senatorial district of Cross River state.\n\nBut describing the consensus as contrived and taken \u2018amid good food and vintage liquor\u2019, the Director-General of Chris Agara Campaign Organisation, Richard Ogbeche, in a statement dissociated them from the arrangement, saying \u201cwe are not part of the so-called \u2018consensus\u2019 APC candidature.\u201d\n\nThe statement said as legitimate members of the APC, they have always respected and will continue to respect the lawful decisions of the party and all its organs at all levels, but added that such respect and loyalty should however be mutual since the leadership of the party and the governor are as important to the members as the members should be important to them.\n\nAgara pointed out the grave disrespect to some governorship aspirants and assured its teeming supporters that he remains committed and competitive in the race and is prepared to pursue his aspiration to its logical conclusion.\n\nThe emergence of the Chancellor and owner of Arthur Jarvis University, Sir Arthur Jarvis Archibong, as the PDP Southern Senatorial Elders Forum consensus aspirant ahead of the party\u2019s governorship primary has not only unsettled some aspirants, but thrown the party in the zone into confusion.\n\nJarvis who polled the majority votes during the Southern Senatorial district PDP leaders\u2019 meeting, was named the unanimous choice of the Southern Senatorial district against other aspirants including Senator Gershom Bassey, Daniel Asuquo, Efiok Cobham, Amb. Nkoyo Toyo and Pastor Eyo Okpoene.\n\nThe meeting held on May 8, 2022 and presided over by the former Governor Donald Duke was aimed at encouraging the aspirants to, on their own accord, whittle down their numbers and thus enhance the chances for the success of a Southern candidate for the party.\n\nDuke in a statement explained that the inability of all the aspirants to present one aspirant led to the decision of the elders in the house to decide on a non-binding straw poll that would reflect the acceptability of the aspirants.\n\nNo doubt, the motive behind the moves for consensus was to see the possibility of both APC and PDP in the state coasting easily for a no contest and then affirming their candidates on the D-Day. But it is clear that the consensus arrangement is in the balance.\n\nAs it stands, both parties are working on a tightrope as it is certain that all the aspirants who have been cleared are going into contest.\n\nAbia: Crisis of succession boiling over\n\nTwenty four years since it has been in the saddle, the PDP in Abia State has never had the kind of crisis it is going through now. Analysts argue that the crisis is such that if nothing is urgently done, the party may not come out of it without serious bruises.\n\nAt the center of the problem is the race for 2023; which zone in the state will produce Governor Okezie Ikpeazu\u2019s successor. While Abia North Senatorial District insist that power must return to the zone where it started in 1999, the Ngwa axis which is presently holding on to power, are insisting a segment of it (Umunneato) in Abia Central would produce the next governor.\n\nThe leadership of the party in the state has not helped matters when it zoned the governorship ticket to both Abia North and Abia Central at the same time. With this arrangement, the Ngwa in Abia Central, have been accommodated in the race.\n\nThis strange zoning arrangement, created some controversies. Critical stakeholders of PDP in Abia, including former Senate President, Adolph Wabara, former governor of Abia State, Senator Theodore Orji; former NDDC, Chairman, Chief Onyema Ugochukwu, former SSG, Dr. Eme Okoro, amongst others who had earlier insisted that power must shift back to Abia North, condemned the zoning arrangement, warning of its inherent consequences for the party.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that Ikpeazu was comfortable with the zoning arrangement since it was later discovered the person he was said to have anointed to succeed him, Prof Uche Ikonne is from the Abia Central Senatorial District.\n\nIkpeazu, pitching himself against the major stakeholders of the party, most of who were instrumental to his becoming governor, and the other governorship aspirants, including his deputy, Ude Oko Chukwu; the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abiribe, Ncheta Omerekpe, Nnanna Nwafor, Senator Emma Nwaka, Chima Anyaso and others, the battle line was drawn. The battle of who controls the 3-man delegates that would vote for Ikpeazu\u2019s successor has reached its peak and would be decided this week.\n\nThere are some controversies over the election of the 3-man delegates. Governor Ikpeazu was reported to have been seen in a video, addressing some party members at Obingwa Ward 7 claiming that delegates had been elected.\n\nWhile the State Working Committee (SWC) of the party, appeared to have concurred with the governor over the 3-man delegates election, some stakeholders of the party, and all the other governorship aspirants, except Prof Ikonne insisted there was no 3-man delegates election held in the state.\n\nThe aspirants last week, took their matter to the national leadership of the party in Abuja.\n\nLed by Abaribe, the aspirants who appealed to the party\u2019s NWC to do away with any list submitted by Abia SWC as 3-man delegates list and conduct the Abia governorship primaries with the statutory delegates, warned of the legal consequences of doing otherwise.\n\nThe state secretary of PDP, David Iro said in a statement, there was no delegates election held anywhere in the state and this earned him one month suspension.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has said Abia PDP was yet to conduct its ad-hoc delegate election.\n\nINEC\u2019s position was made known via a letter by its Secretary, Rose Oriaran-Anthony in response to an enquiry made by a legal practitioner.\n\nHowever, as the battle over the 3-ad hoc list rages, one Mr. Akuoma Friday on May 17, 2022 went to court and obtained an Exparte Order making it mandatory for the controversial three-man adhoc delegates as the only electors at the primaries in Abia State.\n\nThe court presided over by Justice C.U Okoroafor, adjourned till May 25, 2022, the day of the governorship primary, for hearing on the matter.\n\nBy the order, it means statutory delegates in Abia State have been barred from participating in the primaries.\n\nSome stakeholders of the party have in the light of the above, appealed to the national leadership of the party to reschedule the primaries in Abia to allow for the vacation of the court order, to avoid Abia from going the way of Zamfara after the 2019 elections wherein the state was disqualified from having participated in the election.\n\nWhatever happens, this week, Governor Ikpeazu\u2019s successor will be known.\n\nEbonyi: Battle reaches crescendo\n\nThe battle over who succeeds Governor David Umahi in 2023 has reached a crescendo with senatorial zones, clans and major political actors at each other\u2019s jugular.\n\nAspirants under the ruling APC are the Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Francis Nwifuru; immediate past Chairman of Revenue Mobilization Allocation And Fiscal Commission, Elias Mbam; Labour party candidate in the 2015 general elections, Edward Nkwegu (all from the North), and former Senator Julius Ali UchA (from the central).\n\nBut Governor Umahi who hails from the Southern part of the state has already anointed the Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Mr. Francis Nwifuru, as his choice of successor.\n\nNwifuru who hails from Izzi clan in the Northern Senatorial District of the state was among the 16 lawmakers who defected from the PDP to the APC in solidarity with Governor Umahi when he defected to APC in the year 2020.\n\nUmahi openly endorsed the lawmaker in April during a burial ceremony in Okposi, Ohaozara local government area of the state.\n\nHowever, the endorsement of Nwifuru by the governor did not go down well with other aspirants and some critical political actors especially the founding members of the APC in the state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe first to reject the endorsement was the former Ebonyi Central Senator and pioneer Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly,Mr. Julius Ucha, who is also a governoship aspirant on the platform of the APC.\n\nUcha who was a member of the Action Congress of Nigeria(ACN) that merged to form the APC in 2013, described the Speaker\u2019s endorsement as undemocratic and unacceptable.\n\nHe pointedly told Governor Umahi that the endorsement of the Speaker will fail.\n\nUcha who hails from the majority Ezza clan in the central senatorial district vowed to contest the election.\n\nThe former Ebonyi Central Senator who had emerged a consensus APC govership aspirant for Ezza clan advised Governor Umahi to quickly rescind the endorsement to give all aspirants a level playing ground.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abakaliki, Ucha who was the candidate of the party in 2015 general elections, warned that any attempt to circumvent democratic process in the party\u2019s primary election will be vehemently rejected.\n\nWhile the dust raised by Ucha\u2019s press conference was yet to settle, a faction of the party in the state that operated under the aegis of Old APC stakeholders led by a factional Chairman of the party in the state, Harou Ajah, petitioned President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Chairman of APC, Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nIn the petition which was also published in some national dailies, the Old APC members alleged that the Speaker of the assembly endorsed by the governor was not a member of the party.\n\nAjah claimed that Nwifuru and 15 other lawmakers sacked by the Federal High Court Abuja over their alleged defection to APC had sworn affidavit and presented to the Appeal Court that they never defected to APC and asked the appellate court to reverse their sack.\n\nInterestingly, intra-party wrangling ahead of the primary elections is also heating up the PDP in the state.\n\nPolitical interests and sectional sentiments have also caused serious disaffections among major political players in the opposition PDP.\n\nBut the real bone of contention in the PDP is the struggle among the three senatorial zones over which zone should take the gubernatorial ticket ahead of the general elections.\n\nSome argue that since the governorship has rotated peacefully among the three Senatorial zones, the ticket should return to Ebonyi North where it started in 1999.\n\nFirst civilian Governor of the state and Senator representing Ebonyi North in the National Assembly, Dr. Sam Egwu belongs to this school of thought.\n\nBut the Ezza people in the central senatorial district have vehemently rejected the idea arguing that being the eldest clan, and given the pivotal roles played by their sons during the struggle for the creation of the state, they should be given the opportunity to produce the governor of the state in 2023.\n\nRivers: Battle of old rivals\n\nThe situation is not going to be much different in Rivers, the oil-rich state.\n\nIn Rivers, the governor, Nyesom Wike, is a strong politician to reckon with. He has his unique style of playing politics and it works for him.\n\nAnalysts see him as a rugged politician, who uses that approach to bulldoze his way to victory.\n\nHowever, the game is not likely to be an easy one as he will once again confront his arch opponent and current minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi who is the leader of the APC in the state.\n\nSome argue that with the irreconcilable internal crisis between the Amaechi and Senator Magnus Abe factions, the Wike-led PDP would take advantage of the crisis to victory. The crisis in APC, which has lingered for seven years is not likely to end now as none of the factions is willing to sheathe its sword.\n\nHowever, critical observers are also not sure how the ruling PDP will settle its own brewing crisis owing to the number of aspirants who want to succeed Governor Wike.\n\nThe aspirants include the former PDP chairman in the state, Felix Obuah, former Secretary to the State Government, Tammy Danagogo, Senator George Sekibo, former Deputy Governor, Tele Ikuru, Senator Lee Maeba, former Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Austin Opara, Isaac Kamalu and Mr. Sim Harry.\n\nThere is a strong rumour that the governor may either favour Kamalu or Harry but the snag is that they are believed by Rivers people, to be politically unpopular even though both of them held sensitive appointments in Wike\u2019s administration.\n\nAlso, there are speculations that the governor might decide to allow the Rivers South-East senatorial district to produce his successor to settle the Ogoni ethnic nationality whose people have decried decades of political marginalization in the state.\n\nSo, as it is, nobody can authoritatively predict who succeeds Governor Wike in 2023 but the flag bearers of the two major parties will likely be known this week.\n\nBenue: It\u2019s Ortom Versus Akume\n\nIn Benue, the battle is between the PDP, the ruling party in the state and the main opposition party, APC. For those who know the state, it is going to be a tough battle in view of the fact that the incumbent, Samuel Ortom of the PDP will be facing the APC led by a former governor of the state and Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the PDP being in power is the party to beat in the state.\n\nAs at the last count in the PDP, it was gathered that 14 governorship aspirants had bought forms, submitted and have been screened and ready to participate in the primaries.\n\nIt would be recalled that the party, after serious deliberation with stakeholders from the three Senatorial districts of the state, had adopted the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Titus Uba as consensus aspirant for the 14 Tiv Speaking Local Government Areas and the Deputy Governor, Benson Abounu as consensus aspirant for the 9 Idoma and Igede speaking LGAs.\n\nAlthough, the party tried to adopt a consensus, 12 out of the over 30 aspirants who earlier indicated interest to contest the election refused the consensus arrangement and went ahead to purchase nomination forms.\n\nBut after series of meetings and consultations with the 12 aspirants who had purchased their forms, eight of them from the Tiv speaking area agreed to toe the party\u2019s decision to adopt Uba as their aspirant.\n\nThe aspirants made their stance known on Friday, May 20th, 2023 after a meeting with Governor Samuel Ortom and Senator Gabriel Suswam at the Government House in Makurdi to finalise their consultations ahead of the party\u2019s primaries.\n\nThe aspirants who gave their nod to the aspiration of Uba include, Barr. Chille lgbawua, Arc. Joe Ikyaagba, Dr Jibo, Mrs. Susan Waya, Dr. Paul Ubwa, Dr. Paul Orhii, Dr. Akumbur and Dr. Dominic Akaahan.\n\nAlso, in a chat with newsmen shortly after the meeting, Igbauwa who is Chairman of the Forum of PDP Governorship aspirants in the state, disclosed that eight out of the 12 of them that purchased their nomination forms have agreed to work together to ensure that the consensus candidate of the party is returned at the forthcoming primary election without rancour.\n\nHe said they were committed to following all the processes prescribed by law and ensuring that due process was followed in support of Uba so that at the end of the day, their agreement would be lawful.\n\nIgbawua who was flanked by Governor Ortom, Senator Suswam and the other aspirants also said their meeting was to consolidate their decision and resolutions when 10 of them met Thursday, May 19th, 2022 on the matter.\n\nSo, as it stands now, and barring any last minute change, six gubernatorial aspirants on the platform of the PDP will be slugging it out at the Party\u2019s primaries billed to hold this week.\n\nThe aspirants who will be going into the PDP primaries include, Titus Uba, Benson Abounu, Dennis Ityavyar, Ben Akaakar, Paul Angya and Terkaa Ucha.\n\nBut in the APC, out of the 32 aspirants who indicated interests to contest the number one seat, only 12 have purchased the nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nOf the number, it was gathered that 10 were favoured by the zoning arrangements of the party while two others who were zoned out of the contest went ahead to get the ruling party\u2019s nomination forms.\n\nThe party had zoned the governorship seat to the Jechira intermediate area of Zone \u201cA\u201d comprising Vandeikya and Konshisha Local government areas as well as aspirants from the Benue South Senatorial District known as Zone \u201cC.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s Publicity Secretary, Dan-Morgan Ihomun, in an interview told Daily Sun that with the new zoning arrangement, only two aspirants who had bought the nomination forms for the governorship seat were not favoured.\n\nAccording to Ihomun, the names of those aspirants zoned out of the contest who bought nomination forms include former Attorney General of the Federation, Mike Kaase Aondoakaa as well as immediate past Chief of Staff to Governor Samuel Ortom, Pastor Terwase Orbunde.\n\nAsked what becomes of those who had bought the nomination forms but were not favoured by the zoning arrangement, the Publicity Secretary said the party will not stop them from participating in the primaries in any way.\n\n\u201cThe issue is very simple for those from the local governments that are zoned out of the contest but went ahead to buy forms. As you know, the zoning and consensus has to be accepted by all the candidates themselves and in the event that they do not accept the decision of the party, of course they are free to go into the election. If they win fine, it is as simple as that.\n\n\u201cSo, as it is, only Aondoakaa and Orbunde are out of the zoning arrangements,\u201d Ihomun added.\n\nThe Party\u2019s publicity scribe also disclosed that the leader of the party in the state and Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, as a party man and law abiding citizen of the country, would not interfere in the selection process of who emerges as the party\u2019s flag bearer during the primaries.\n\nAkwa Ibom: Not yet Uhuru for Uno\n\nThe succession train in Akwa Ibom has not derailed from its usual high-tension manipulations, accusations, intrigues, disappointments, rancour, squander-mania and bandwagon effect. It has always been so since 1999.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s attempt to wrap up the issue of who succeeds him by anointing Mr.Umo Eno, his erstwhile commissioner for lands and water resources, ran into seeming serious troubled waters with avalanche of condemnations, criticisms, zoning jingoism, hues and cries, threats and blackmail.\n\nThe governor, who seemed unperturbed up to the point of ignoring the rancour at home to pick the PDP presidential nomination form, appears to have weathered the storm, especially if the party would deploy the ad-hoc delegates in the primaries as those who mounted stiff opposition and appeared to have boxed the governor and his successor-apparent into a corner, could be deflated at the primaries.\n\nSo other things being equal, Umo Eno is coasting home to PDP nomination victory leaving Onofiok Luke and Sen Bassey Albert to decide who comes second and third while rest of the pack only as former aspirants. This is because the state government is in total control of nearly 4000 adhoc delegates and some sizable number of statutory delegates.\n\nThe realisation of impending failure has caused some aspirants to defect to the main opposition party, APC, which however is embroiled in its characteristic factional squabbles with two state chairmen and some state executive Council members.\n\nSuch defectors include Mr Akan Udofia, said to have bought forms in both political parties, but recently declared for APC.\n\nAnalysts believe that unless Sen Godswill Akpabio gets the presidential ticket to boost the moral of APC, the party may soon sing its nunc dimittis in the state; and the impending governorship feud between Senators John Akpanudoedehe and Ita Enang, could even make its case worse.\n\nPlateau: Immersed in cloud of uncertainty\n\nIn Plateau State, a cloud of political uncertainty is hovering round the APC and PDP as delegates prepare to select candidates who will fly the tickets of the two parties in 2023.\n\nNine governorship aspirants purchased the nomination forms of APC and have been cleared by the party to contest the party primaries billed for Thursday May 27, 2022 while 18 aspirants purchased the PDP nomination forms and have also been cleared to contest the primaries scheduled for Wednesday, May 25, 2023.\n\nThe number appears very high in the PDP due to the cost of nomination forms compared to the APC where about 20 persons had earlier indicated interest in the governorship but only nine afforded the N50 million to pick the form.\n\nPolitical pundits believe that the opposition PDP has greater number of aspirants based on the fact that PDP is grounded in the state and has high chances of producing Lalong\u2019s successor if the mistake of 2015 is not repeated.\n\nAll aspirants in each political parties are working round the clock, clinging on political bigwigs in the state to outsmart one another with a view to clinch the ticket of their respective parties.\n\nAcross the two major political parties, the voting pattern would be based on the existing political blocs in the respective parties. In the APC, the contest is between the Governor Simon Lalong bloc, Sen. Joshua Dariye bloc and those who are scrambling for relevance.\n\nFor PDP, the political relevance and influence of former Governor Jonah David Jang would determine who picks the ticket as all the aspirants are holding tight to their political ideology to gain sympathy of the delegates.\n\nLiterally, the two major parties have zoned the governorship seat to Plateau Central where virtually all the aspirants hail from with the exception of few who came out from different Senatorial zones.\n\nNames that are popping up, likely to fly the ticket of the APC includes Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda, former Resident Electoral Commission, INEC, Benue State, Dr. Patrick Dakum, Chief Executive Officer of the Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria (IHVN), Prof. Sonni Tyoden, Deputy Governor of Plateau State, Mr. Sunday Biggs, Former Permanent Secretary, Plateau State Government and Nde David Victor Dimka, former Comptroller of Nigeria Custom Service among others.\n\nIt is rumoured that Governor Simon Lalong has issued directive to the party, local government chairmen and all his appointees to deliver Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda, a development that has heated politicking in the ruling APC.\n\nSimilarly, the strongest contenders in the PDP includes Caleb Mutfwang, a technocrat and former Executive Chairman of Mangu Local Government Area, Timothy Golu, former member, House of Representatives, Prof. Shedrack Best, former Secretary to Plateau State Government, Amb. Bagudu Hirse, former Nigeria Ambassador and former Minister of Forieign Affairs and Mr. Dauda Gotring, a former Banker and former Staff of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nAn ardent supporter of the PDP would consider the factors crucial because of the allegations of anti-party by some PDP members during the 2015 election that led power out of the party.\n\nIn the APC, it is alleged that Governor Lalong has pitched tent with Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda due to the crucible role he allegedly played as INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner of Benue State in returning Lalong in 2019 against all odds.\n\nThe rumour has unsettled other aspirants who believe that they are credible, competent and spent huge resources to nurture and sustain the party since inception in 2014.\n\nThe aggrieved aspirants had in a press conference in Jos endorsed by 18 aspirants including those who couldn\u2019t afford the nomination forms asked the governor to revert his decision of contemplating dumping the party for another.\n\nBut the state APC chairman, Rufus Bature cleared the air that the party has no preferred candidate for the primaries and said a level playing ground would be provided for all aspirants to contest for the party ticket.\n\nHe noted that the party is working round the clock to consolidate on the victory of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nKaduna: It\u2019s battle royale\n\nToday, what is uppermost in the minds of the people of Kaduna State is who takes over from the incumbent governor, Nasir El-rufai in 2023.\n\nInterestingly, a good number of politicians from other political parties, particularly the APC) and PDP have declared their intentions and picked forms for the number one seat of the state.\n\nBut feelers from within and outside the state have indicated that the interest shown by politicians especially amongst the allies of the incumbent governor is an indication that the primaries in the APC will be more fierce than the El-rufai\u2019s 2015 and 2019 primaries contest.\n\nHowever, recent development has shown that top echelons of the ruling APC are doing everything possible to enforce consensus candidate at the primaries.\n\nHowever, one of the APC contenders Sani Sha\u2019aban has faulted the process of selecting delegates by the party in Kaduna and has since written a petition to challenge it.\n\nThe congresses were done by consensus by APC\u2019s elections guidelines and constitution in the 23 Local Government Areas of Kaduna State last weekend.\n\nBut, the Appeals Committee for the Ad-hoc Delegate Congresses of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State, has upheld the Congress, describing the exercise as successful.\n\nMeanwhile, the leading opposition party in the state, the PDP held a consensus building meeting. The meeting was said to be a signal to the ruling party that PDP is now ready to take over power in the coming elections.\n\nIn PDP, the 2019 Gubernatorial Candidate in Kaduna, Isa Ashiru appears to be the most favoured aspirant. In the 2019 election, Ashiru came second, while Governor El-rufai was declared the winner of the election.\n\nOyo: Intrigues and horse trading at its best\n\nBarring last minute changes, the 2023 gubernatorial poll in Oyo State will be a straight contest between the PDP and the APC.\n\nFrom all indications, the incumbent governor, Seyi Makinde of PDP will emerge as the party\u2019s candidate. Though a former deputy governor of the state, Hazeem Gbolarumi, has also indicated interest to contest the governorship poll on the platform of PDP, political pundits have observed that he has no chance against Governor Makinde.\n\nIn the APC, there are many gladiators jostling to get the party\u2019s gubernatorial ticket. They include a former deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Chief Adebayo Adelabu, who was the party\u2019s governorship candidate in 2019; the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local Content, Teslim Folarin, who was the Senate Leader between 2007 and 2011; former chairman, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Akeem Agbaje; a cardiovascular surgeon and former Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Azeez Adeduntan; and an engineer, Alao Oyedele.\n\nA legal luminary, Chief Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), has also shown interest in getting the governorship ticket of APC. The Chairman, National Communication Commission (NCC), Prof Adeolu Akande, is also among the governorship aspirants on the APC platform.\n\nInvestigation carried out by Daily Sun\u2019s reporter revealed that the contest for the governorship ticket of APC is really between Adebayo Adelabu, and Teslim Folarin. Further investigation has also shown that Adelabu may be the favoured aspirant that will eventually emerge as the APC governorship candidate.\n\nFederal lawmakers, who are privy to the disposition of some powers that be in Abuja, have, however, made it known that discussion is on for Adelabu to get the party\u2019s governorship ticket, while Folarin should return to the Senate from Oyo Central senatorial district. The caveat is that Adelabu must return partially the money spent so far by Folarin in pursuing his gubernatorial ambition. But the final decision has not been taken ahead of the governorship primary of APC that will be held on Thursday, this week.\n\nIt was further revealed that Adelabu is being favoured because he was the 2019 governorship candidate of the APC , when he garnered over 350,000 votes and came second after Seyi Makinde of PDP that won the poll.\n\nThen, another factor that is working in favour of Adelabu is the fact that he bought scores of Sienna cars that were used for campaign in 2019. After he lost the poll, he did not ask the beneficiaries to return them. The people have been using the cars since then.\n\nMeanwhile, the way things are now, Governor Seyi Makinde and Adebayo Adelabu, will emerge as PDP and APC governorship candidates respectively. The candidates of other political parties may either contest against the duo, or form alliances, either with PDP, or APC.\n\nChecks also showed that developments within the PDP and APC have made it very difficult for political analysts to say with certainty, who will emerge as the state governor in 2023. The internal wranglings within the PDP and APC have made the governorship poll very dicey.\n\nAt present, the governorship aspirants across the political parties are scrambling for the soul of delegates, and favour of political leadership to emerge as candidates.\n\nNasarawa: Gov Sule versus three PDP gladiators\n\nIn Nasarawa, the political atmosphere is charged. Governor Abdullahi Sule of APC is eligible to run for re-election, and had made his intention known to the Nasarawa people when supporters of the governor under the aegis of Abdullahi Sule Amalgamated Support Groups, led by one Murtala Abubakar-Muhammad, had purchased the N50 million expression of interest and nomination forms, aimed at compelling the governor to seek reelection.\n\nDeclaring his intention to run for a second term in office in Lafia, Sule said he was re-contesting the governorship seat in 2023 to justify the efforts of his supporters who had contributed their funds to purchase the forms for him.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome of these people who are barely making a living came together and raised the funds to buy the nomination and expression of interest forms for me to re-contest for the 2023 governorship election.\n\n\u201cThis gesture is very touchy and important to me, so I cannot turn down their request. Therefore, I hereby declare to re-contest as governor in the 2023 election.\n\nBut a twist unfolded as the former wife of the present National Chairman of the APC, Hakiyat Fatima Hussain Abdullahi picked the expression of Interest and Nomination form to contest for the governorship position in Nasarawa State.\n\nPicking the form at the party Secretariat through the national organising secretary, Suleiman Muhammad Argungu, she said the quest to contest is to alleviate poverty from the people of the state and to ensure equal representation of women in politics.\n\nWith the development, it is therefore important to note that Hajia Fatima is aspiring to contest in the party primaries against the incumbent governor, Abdullahi Sule, who has declared his intention to contest for the second term last week.\n\nWhen Daily Sun contacted stakeholders in APC, none agreed to comment on the issue in other to avoid taking sides between the different camps emerging in the state.\n\nBut for Sule to get his second term bid, he must contend with three gladiators of the PDP who have come together towards ensuring taking power off the ruling APC.\n\nAll the three aspirants of the PDP in Nasarawa pledged to accept the outcome of the forthcoming primaries in good faith.",
          "summary": "Cross River: Consensus collapsesIn Cross River, the consensus option initially envisaged has collapsed as the APC, PDP governorship aspirants head for primaries.\nThe Chairman, National Communication Commission (NCC), Prof Adeolu Akande, is also among the governorship aspirants on the APC platform.\nFurther investigation has also shown that Adelabu may be the favoured aspirant that will eventually emerge as the APC governorship candidate.\nMeanwhile, the way things are now, Governor Seyi Makinde and Adebayo Adelabu, will emerge as PDP and APC governorship candidates respectively.\nAt present, the governorship aspirants across the political parties are scrambling for the soul of delegates, and favour of political leadership to emerge as candidates.",

          "text": "\n\n*Nigeria and others to benefit from AfDB\u2019s $1.5bn Africa\u2019s food facility\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday debunked reports that it planned to replace the conventional Naira notes in circulation with digital currency, otherwise known as the eNaira, in due course.\n\n\n\nThis is as the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group\u2019s Board has approved a $ 1.5 billion facility to support African countries deal with the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war impacting food prices and availability.\n\n\n\nCBN\u2019s Director of Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, said the misleading statement purportedly made at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement on eNaira adoption in Asaba, Delta, was misconstrued and therefore, urged the public to completely disregard it.\n\n\n\nNwanisobi further explained that the digital version of the Naira is meant to complement the existing currency notes and therefore, would circulate simultaneously with the conventional Naira notes as means of exchange and store of value.\n\n\n\nHe said the adoption of the digital legal tender, aside from its safety and speedy features, would also ensure greater access to financial services by the underbanked and unbanked populace thereby enhancing financial inclusion.\n\n\n\nHe urged the public and business owners to embrace digital currency as it offers more possibilities.\n\nThe eNaira was formally launched into circulation by President Muhammadu Buhari in October last year.\n\nThe apex bank\u2019s governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had recently expressed optimism that the bank would achieve the 85 per cent financial inclusion target which is currently at about 70 per cent.\n\n\n\nAddressing a delegation of Executive Directors from the Bank of Uganda, who was on an experience sharing tour of the CBN\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project, Emefiele said the apex bank remained committed to accelerating the rate at which those who were financially excluded could come into the formal banking sector.\n\nHe also expressed satisfaction that the eNaira had recorded some level of success judging by the rate of integration and security features.\n\n\n\nThe central bank governor said the CBDC would enhance the relationship between mobile banking and e-business and speed up the rate of financial inclusion.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that the interest that the eNaira continued to attract from other countries and multinational bodies, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, underscored the level and quality of work the CBN had put into the project.\n\n\n\nEmefiele said Nigeria is currently a case study to other climes, being the first country in Africa to launch its CBDC, adding that the country was treading cautiously to ensure it sustains the successes recorded so far.\n\nHe also told the visiting team that the country had deepened its payment system infrastructure, which is ranked among the best in the world.\n\n\n\nEmefiele had said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases, and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017.\n\n\n\nHe said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\n\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to clearly establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and our fast-growing payments platforms.\n\nNigeria, Others to Benefit from AfDB\u2019s $1.5bn Africa\u2019s Food Facility\n\nMeanwhile, the AfDB Group\u2019s Board has approved a $ 1.5 billion facility to support African countries deal with the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war impacting food prices and availability\n\nAfDB\u2019s Chief Agriculture Policy Economist and Coordinator of Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme at AfDB, Mr. Philip Boahen, said this at Tamale, Ghana, yesterday.\n\n\n\nBoahen said the facility is expected to reach over 20 million African farmers to deal with the food shortfall.\n\nThe bank, on its website, also said that with the disruption of food supplies arising from the war, Africa now faces a shortage of at least 30 million metric tonnes of food.\n\nAfDB said that food like wheat, maize, and soybeans imported from both countries was majorly affected by the war.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bank, the $1.5 billion, an African Emergency Food Production Facility, is an unprecedented comprehensive initiative to support smallholder farmers in filling the food shortfall.\n\n\n\nThe AfDB said it would provide fertilizer to smallholder farmers across Africa over the next four farming seasons, indicating it will use its convening influence with major fertilizer manufacturers, loan guarantees, and other financial instruments to provide the fertilizers.\n\n\u201cAfrican farmers urgently need high-quality seeds and inputs before the planting season begins in May to immediately boost food supplies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe facility will provide 20 million African smallholder farmers with certified seeds.\n\n\u201cIt will increase access to agricultural fertilizers and enable them to rapidly-produce 38 million tonnes of food.\n\n\u201cThis would be a $12 billion increase in food production in just two years,\u201d the AfDB said.\n\n\n\nThe Bank said the facility would lead to the production of 11 million tonnes of wheat; 18 million tonnes of maize; 6 million tonnes of rice; and 2.5 million tonnes of soybeans.\n\n\n\n\u201dIt will also support market growth and post-harvest management, and create a platform to advocate for critical policy reforms to solve the structural issues that impede farmers from receiving modern inputs.\u201d\n\nAfreximbank, APPO Sign MoU on Energy Transition Bank\n\nMeanwhile, the African Petroleum Producers\u2019 Organisation (APPO) and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish an African Energy Transition Bank.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by Afreximbank\u2019s Media Contact, Mr. Amadou Sall, at the weekend.\n\nSall said the establishment of the energy bank was in support of an African-led energy transition strategy.\n\n\n\nHe said the new institution would accelerate Africa\u2019s economic development while ensuring the progress was compatible with and complementary to, the Sustainable Development Goals,\n\nSall said that the new bank would also ensure compatibility with the continent\u2019s long-term social and environmental objectives as set out in African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.\n\n\n\nHe said that the bank would address an urgent and existential need on the continent.\n\n\u201cAfrica stands to experience profound effects from climate change, while the considerable poverty across the continent further disincentivises a focus on environmental care and sustainability for many populations.\n\n\u201cMoreover, Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry faces growing pressures as international investment in hydrocarbons diminishes.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile Africa\u2019s transition towards alternative energy sources presents great opportunities for the continent, this transition must be carefully managed to minimise the short-term adverse impacts of the transition while maximising its longer-term benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nSall said the new bank\u2019s responsibilities would include the management and encouragement of such a productive transition.\n\n\n\nHe said that APPO member states would be signatories to the Energy Transition Bank\u2019s constitutional documents which would be structured in the form of a multilateral treaty, and invest equity into the new vehicle.\n\nSall said that Afreximbank would co-invest and advise on the establishment and implementation process.\n\nThe statement quoted Prof. Benedict Oramah, President of Afreximbank, as saying \u201cwe are delighted to be collaborating with APPO towards the establishment of the proposed African Energy Transition Bank\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese are challenging times when we must strive to strike the right balance between the imperatives of mitigating climate change and the urgency of averting social upheavals as a result of increasingly difficult economic and financial conditions in Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor us at Afreximbank, supporting the emergence of the African Energy Transition Bank will enable a more efficient and predictable capital allocation between fossil fuels and renewables.\u201d\n\nOramah is quoted to have said that establishing the bank would also free human and other resources at Afreximbank that would make it possible to support its member countries more effectively in the transition to cleaner fuels.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022New law, if signed, may only benefit 2027, off-season electoral processes for APC, PDP as other parties forge ahead\n\n\u2022 PDP begins primaries today\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has sent the new Electoral Act Amendment Bill to the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for legal advice, THISDAY has learnt.\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s decision not to be in a hurry to sign the bill, it was learnt, was to avoid a repeat of the mistake made by members of the National Assembly, who in their effort to punish political appointees, forgot to include themselves as delegates.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation revealed that the new law, if signed, would only benefit the 2027 general election and off-season elections for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nA Presidency source, who confirmed this development last night, further disclosed that the president would await legal advice before signing the bill as recently amended by the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHowever, the PDP yesterday confirmed that the super delegates or statutory delegates would not vote at the state Houses of Assembly and House of Representatives\u2019 primaries of the party scheduled to take place today (Sunday) as they were not elected as delegates.\n\n\n\nFollowing the failure of the National Assembly to recognise themselves, the president, vice president, governors and other elected government officials as statutory delegates in the Electoral Act 2022, the Senate and the House of Representatives had penultimate week passed the amendment to the Act to recognise statutory delegates as voters during primaries, congresses and conventions of all the political parties.\n\n\n\nThe new Section 84(8) introduced in the Act recognises only democratically elected delegates.\n\nIt states: \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rules the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress or meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari, who returned from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) yesterday, had come under intense pressure to sign the fresh amendment bill to the Electoral Act 2022, to ensure that himself, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, members of the National Assembly, governors, their deputies and other statutory delegates of political parties can vote in the parties\u2019 primaries.\n\n\n\nOthers who will be able to vote if Buhari signs the amended Act include the parties\u2019 National Working Committee (NWC) members, state party chairmen, secretaries, local government chairmen, deputies, councillors, and party chairmen in the 774 local government areas.\n\n\n\nBut the Presidency source told THISDAY that Buhari was not in a hurry to sign the bill to avoid the repeat of the previous mistake made by the National Assembly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the president receives every bill, he seeks the advice of all relevant agencies. In this case, he has sent the bill to the AGF and INEC for advice. So, he is not in a hurry to sign it. That was how the National Assembly was in a hurry and so busy punishing political appointees that they forgot to include themselves as delegates. Whenever he signs it, it takes effect for subsequent elections,\u201d the source explained.\n\n\n\nThe source wondered why the signing of the bill should become a major issue when the political parties have other options to conduct their primaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have three options \u2013 direct, indirect and consensus. In the case of indirect primary, they have already provided for the use of elected delegates and there is nothing wrong with that. In PDP, they have elected three ad hoc delegates \u2013 one national delegate and two others. In APC, there are five delegates. Other political parties have their own provisions. So, the political parties already have delegates that will vote in their primaries,\u201d the source added.\n\n\n\nWith the president\u2019s hesitant to sign the amendment, it means only national delegates elected at the local government congresses will determine presidential flagbearers of the party.\n\n\n\nThe ad hoc delegates were elected in line with the provisions of Section 84 (8) of the Amended Electoral Act 2022.\n\nSection 82(3) of the Electoral Act, 2022 makes it mandatory that the primaries must be conducted democratically.\n\n\n\nBy Article 4.5 of the INEC\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Political Party Primaries, a political party that adopts the indirect primary mode shall make available to the commission, not later than seven days to the date of the primary, the list of persons that will form the delegates that are eligible to vote for the nomination of the party\u2019s candidates to contest every eligible position.\n\n\n\nAccording to the guidelines, the list of delegates shall be accompanied by the list of aspirants and the list of the party\u2019s electoral panel conducting the primary.\n\n\n\nWith the commencement of primaries this week, it is already late for the amended Act to be used for the election of parties\u2019 candidates for the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nAPC\u2019s presidential primary holds on May 29 and 30, while the PDP presidential primary is slated for May 28 and 29.\n\nPDP has already confirmed that the super delegates or statutory delegates will not vote at today\u2019s primaries of the party as they were not elected for the 2022 primary elections.\n\n\n\nThe main opposition party confirmed this in a statement issued yesterday titled: \u201cUse of elected delegates for the primaries and national convention,\u201d by its National Organising Secretary, Mr. Umar Bature.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, 2022, delegates to vote at the indirect primaries and National Convention of political parties to elect candidates for elections shall be those democratically elected for that purpose only.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsequently, those qualified and eligible to vote as delegates in the forthcoming primaries and National Convention of our great party, the PDP are the three ad hoc delegates per ward, elected at the ward congresses, and one national delegate per local government, elected at the Local Government Area Congresses.\n\n\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the NWC wishes to inform our party members that the state Houses of Assembly primaries to elect our state Houses of Assembly candidates, earlier scheduled for Saturday, May 21, 2022, will now hold on Sunday, May 22, 2022, from 8:00 am to 12 noon; while the House of Representatives primaries to elect our House of Representatives candidates will also hold on Sunday, May 22, 2022, from 2:00 pm.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll aspirants, critical stakeholders, leaders, and teeming members of our party should please take note,\u201d Bature explained.\n\n\n\nBy implications, only 326,081 delegates elected in 28 states and FCT during the three-man delegate elections will vote across 36 states to elect governorship, and members of House of Representatives candidates will vote as from today.\n\n\n\nThere are 8,813 wards in Nigeria multiplied by 28 states where the governorship elections will take place.\n\nSimilarly, only 810 delegates elected in the 774 local government areas and area councils of the FCT in the one-man delegate election will decide the PDP presidential flag bearer.\n\n\n\nThis has led to calls to shift the primaries to enable President Buhari to sign into law the amendment to section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nFor instance, speaking at the Round table conference of the Abuja School of Politics and Social Thoughts, Professor Sam Amadi, who was the former Chairman of the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Prof. Udenta Udenta and Kelechi Azubuike accused the members of the National Assembly of cutting their face to spite the nose.\n\n\n\nThe trio of Sam Amadi, Udenta Udenta, and Kelechi Azubuike said that by the old Section 84 (8) waiting to be signed into law, the federal makers cannot even vote at the congresses and presidential primaries because they were not specifically elected for that purpose.\n\nTo salvage the situation, they appealed to INEC to extend the datelines for the political parties to elect their flag bearers.\n\n\n\nThey also appealed to INEC to alternately issue a guideline as a regulator to guide the political parties on the issue of section 84 (8).\n\n\n\nHowever, Civil Society Groups on electoral matters yesterday rejected the demand for an extension of the timetable and schedule of elections so far released by the INEC as requested by the 18 political parties, stating that to do so would pose danger to the electoral processes.\n\nSeveral CSOs, in a statement, commended INEC for rejecting the IPAC request for extension.\n\n\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Political Intrigues Between Two Corrupt Nigerian Public Figures Led To Detention, Grilling Of Former NDDC MD Over N47billion Fraud",
          "text": "The arrest of the former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Nsima Ekere, has been linked to the political scheming by former Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nMr. Ekere was on his way to Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, in Nigeria's South-South region, when he received an invitation to report to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday.\n\nThe former NDDC boss was said to have promptly changed his travel plans and boarded a flight from Abuja where he resides to Lagos to honour the invitation of the anti-graft agency.\n\nOn arrival at the commission, he was confronted with accusations of corruptly enriching himself while serving as MD of the NDDC between November 2016 and January 2019 and was promptly detained.\n\nA statement issued by EFCC and posted on its website said Mr. Ekere was being held for alleged diversion of funds to the tune of N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nHowever, the EFCC released the former Managing Director of the NDDC, Ekere on Sunday.\n\nA source in the EFCC told SaharaReporters on Sunday that \"Ekere has been released on bail\".\n\nSee Also Corruption Alleged N47bn Fraud: Nigerian Anti-graft Agency, EFCC Releases Ex-Managing Director Of Niger Delta Development Commission, Nsima Ekere\n\nBut the details of the bail conditions were not known as of the time of filing this report.\n\nEkere was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly diverting N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nWhile details of the alleged fund's diversion by the former NDDC are still unknown, the timing of the arrest and the dramatic nature of it point to the high-level political power play in his home state of Akwa Ibom.\n\nIn Abuja and across Akwa Ibom, the word has been out that President Muhammadu Buhari was considering Mr. Ekere as the replacement to Mr. Akpabio at the Niger Delta Ministry.\n\nBut findings reveal that Mr. Akpabio is pushing for Etekamba Umoren, his chief of staff at the Niger Delta Ministry and a former Secretary to the Government of Akwa Ibom State during his tenure as governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nMany believe that Mr. Ekere\u2019s arrest and detention are meant to dent his nomination for the ministerial job and pave the way for the emergence of Mr. Umoren, who is a stooge of Mr. Akpabio.\n\nThe argument hinged on the fact that Mr. Akpabio has been serially indicted for corruption not only in the NDDC but also when he was the governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nSince 2020, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom has been embroiled in factional crises with Akpabio leading one faction and other leaders like Senator John Akpan Udoedeghe, Umana Okon Umana, Don Etiebiet and Mr. Ekere hauled together to wrest control of the party from the former Niger Delta Affairs minister.\n\nWhile Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction succeeded in using the court and his closeness to the centre of power to grab the chairmanship of the party, it has been tough uniting the members and getting them ready for the election.\n\nMr. Ekere, who was APC\u2019s governorship candidate at the last election, by the party convention, should be the leader of the party in the state.\n\nBut Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction has contested this position, insisting that the minister, as the highest-ranking political officer from the state, is the natural leader.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Ekere is said to have been making overtures to unite the party, share positions and integrate all factions into the mainstream, a position Mr. Akpabio, and his men are said to be stoutly objected to.\n\nMr. Ekere\u2019s other sin is his support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is a frontline presidential aspirant in the ruling party and a major obstacle to Mr. Akpabio\u2019s ambition to become Nigeria\u2019s president on the platform of the APC.\n\nIt is also learnt that Mr. Osinbajo first considered Mr. Akpabio as his presidential campaign coordinator in Akwa Ibom but switched to Mr. Ekere when the former Niger Delta minister declared to run for President.\n\nThe Vice President is said to have settled for Mr. Ekere because of his political reach and outlook.\n\nHistory Of Frosty Relationship Between Akpabio And Ekere\n\nMany insist that Mr. Akpabio has had a long frosty relationship with Mr. Ekere.\n\nThe duo contested the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) governorship primary in 2006 to succeed former Governor Victor Attah.\n\nHowever, the primary did not produce a clear winner and Mr. Akpabio negotiated victory which meant he had to name Mr. Ekere as his running mate.\n\nA few weeks later, Mr. Ekere was dropped based on a negotiated term by the PDP to allow Mr. Attah to nominate the deputy governorship candidate in the person of Patrick Ekpotu.\n\nMr. Ekpotu served for one term and Mr. Ekere was picked to run with Mr. Akpabio in 2011, a ploy many said was to retire the man from politics.\n\nJust as he was being sworn in, a plan was hatched to impeach Mr. Ekere a few months into the office so he would not be able to contest for any elective position.\n\nMr. Ekere escaped that fate by resigning a day before the house of assembly was to start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nEven with his resignation, the lawmakers were still bent on going ahead with his impeachment process.\n\nMr. Ekere moved to the APC in 2015 after he was frustrated out of the governorship race.\n\nHe and many APC leaders at the time had resisted Mr. Akpabio\u2019s moves to decamp to the party when he negotiated to join the party after the EFCC arrested and filed corruption charges against him.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom APC leaders were also said to have argued that the corruption baggage on Mr. Akpabio\u2019s neck, while he was governor, would work against the party at the election.\n\nAkpabio joined APC in 2018, contested and lost the senatorial election but got rewarded with an appointment as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nMany people see him more as the Minister of NDDC which has had five chief executives since 2019.\n\nAkpabio's Corruption Cases\n\nMeanwhile, Akpabio was also detained in April 2021 after he attempted to bribe the Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa, SaharaReporters had reported.\n\nAccording to sources, Akpabio was trying to bribe the EFCC Chairman because of the tons of corruption allegations against him, dating back to the time he was governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nIt was learnt that the meeting between Akpabio and Bawa was arranged by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had recently been embroiled in a N5 million bribery controversy himself.\n\nAkpabio was said to have taken the $350,000 in cash personally to Bawa before he was detained.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that it took a call from the Aso Villa to the EFCC Chairman to get Akpabio and his aides released.\n\nA top source in the EFCC had said, \"He arrived at the EFCC office with five others and headed to meet the newly appointed Chairman, Bawa.\n\n\"The Attorney General of the Federation who was recently arranged the meeting for the minister. You remember his bribery issue with Malami himself involving $5 million.\n\n\"He was ushered in at 1 pm to see the EFCC chairman while carrying the money personally. He was arrested and detained, along with his aides, all six of them. It was a call from the Villa that got him released after two hours.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Akpabio had also bribed Malami and others with $5 million to get Effiong Akwa appointed as the sole administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission, an allegation both of them denied.\n\nThere had also been allegations of N40 billion fraud perpetrated in the NDDC which was under the supervision of Akpabio's ministry, explaining the pressure on Akpabio to clear the weight of corruption allegations hanging on his neck.\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives had in 2020 resolved to probe the alleged N40 billion financial recklessness of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC in the previous three months.\n\nBut Akpabio, whose ministry supervised the agency, swiftly released a statement entitled \u201cRe: National Assembly probes alleged N40bn corruption in NDDC\u201d, saying under the supervision of the Niger Delta Affairs ministry, no corruption had been recorded in the NDDC\n\nAlso, there had been allegations of over N86 billion contract scam involving Akpabio and the former Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, which the EFCC had been looking into.\n\nNoting the pressure on Akpabio, another source had said, \"Don't forget he has tons of corruption cases with the EFCC right from when he was a governor. And now with NDDC scams in billions, he is under a lot of pressure.\n\n\"When Akpabio was released, he called Malami, who had arranged his meeting with the EFCC chairmen, frantically asking him to drive to the EFCC office to explain to Bawa that he didn\u2019t mean to cause him any harm by bribing him but Malami said he was sick.\n\n\"Malami told him he had just returned from Turkey after which he travelled to Sokoto and collapsed in public.\"\n\nSaharaReporters had on April 15, 2021reported how Malami collapsed in Sokoto state while he was there for the inauguration of the reconstructed State High Court complex by Governor Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nMalami had collapsed after delivering his address at the ceremony and was quickly revived by his aides and dignitaries.\n\nHe was subsequently hospitalised at a private facility upon his return to Abuja.",

Mr. Ekere hauled together to wrest control of the party from the former Niger Delta Affairs minister.\n\nWhile Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction succeeded in using the court and his closeness to the centre of power to grab the chairmanship of the party, it has been tough uniting the members and getting them ready for the election.\n\nMr. Ekere, who was APC\u2019s governorship candidate at the last election, by the party convention, should be the leader of the party in the state.\n\nBut Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction has contested this position, insisting that the minister, as the highest-ranking political officer from the state, is the natural leader.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Ekere is said to have been making overtures to unite the party, share positions and integrate all factions into the mainstream, a position Mr. Akpabio, and his men are said to be stoutly objected to.\n\nMr. Ekere\u2019s other sin is his support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is a frontline presidential aspirant in the ruling party and a major obstacle to Mr. Akpabio\u2019s ambition to become Nigeria\u2019s president on the platform of the APC.\n\nIt is also learnt that Mr. Osinbajo first considered Mr. Akpabio as his presidential campaign coordinator in Akwa Ibom but switched to Mr. Ekere when the former Niger Delta minister declared to run for President.\n\nThe Vice President is said to have settled for Mr. Ekere because of his political reach and outlook.\n\nHistory Of Frosty Relationship Between Akpabio And Ekere\n\nMany insist that Mr. Akpabio has had a long frosty relationship with Mr. Ekere.\n\nThe duo contested the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) governorship primary in 2006 to succeed former Governor Victor Attah.\n\nHowever, the primary did not produce a clear winner and Mr. Akpabio negotiated victory which meant he had to name Mr. Ekere as his running mate.\n\nA few weeks later, Mr. Ekere was dropped based on a negotiated term by the PDP to allow Mr. Attah to nominate the deputy governorship candidate in the person of Patrick Ekpotu.\n\nMr. Ekpotu served for one term and Mr. Ekere was picked to run with Mr. Akpabio in 2011, a ploy many said was to retire the man from politics.\n\nJust as he was being sworn in, a plan was hatched to impeach Mr. Ekere a few months into the office so he would not be able to contest for any elective position.\n\nMr. Ekere escaped that fate by resigning a day before the house of assembly was to start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nEven with his resignation, the lawmakers were still bent on going ahead with his impeachment process.\n\nMr. Ekere moved to the APC in 2015 after he was frustrated out of the governorship race.\n\nHe and many APC leaders at the time had resisted Mr. Akpabio\u2019s moves to decamp to the party when he negotiated to join the party after the EFCC arrested and filed corruption charges against him.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom APC leaders were also said to have argued that the corruption baggage on Mr. Akpabio\u2019s neck, while he was governor, would work against the party at the election.\n\nAkpabio joined APC in 2018, contested and lost the senatorial election but got rewarded with an appointment as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nMany people see him more as the Minister of NDDC which has had five chief executives since 2019.\n\nAkpabio's Corruption Cases\n\nMeanwhile, Akpabio was also detained in April 2021 after he attempted to bribe the Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa, SaharaReporters had reported.\n\nAccording to sources, Akpabio was trying to bribe the EFCC Chairman because of the tons of corruption allegations against him, dating back to the time he was governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nIt was learnt that the meeting between Akpabio and Bawa was arranged by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had recently been embroiled in a N5 million bribery controversy himself.\n\nAkpabio was said to have taken the $350,000 in cash personally to Bawa before he was detained.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that it took a call from the Aso Villa to the EFCC Chairman to get Akpabio and his aides released.\n\nA top source in the EFCC had said, \"He arrived at the EFCC office with five others and headed to meet the newly appointed Chairman, Bawa.\n\n\"The Attorney General of the Federation who was recently arranged the meeting for the minister. You remember his bribery issue with Malami himself involving $5 million.\n\n\"He was ushered in at 1 pm to see the EFCC chairman while carrying the money personally. He was arrested and detained, along with his aides, all six of them. It was a call from the Villa that got him released after two hours.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Akpabio had also bribed Malami and others with $5 million to get Effiong Akwa appointed as the sole administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission, an allegation both of them denied.\n\nThere had also been allegations of N40 billion fraud perpetrated in the NDDC which was under the supervision of Akpabio's ministry, explaining the pressure on Akpabio to clear the weight of corruption allegations hanging on his neck.\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives had in 2020 resolved to probe the alleged N40 billion financial recklessness of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC in the previous three months.\n\nBut Akpabio, whose ministry supervised the agency, swiftly released a statement entitled \u201cRe: National Assembly probes alleged N40bn corruption in NDDC\u201d, saying under the supervision of the Niger Delta Affairs ministry, no corruption had been recorded in the NDDC\n\nAlso, there had been allegations of over N86 billion contract scam involving Akpabio and the former Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, which the EFCC had been looking into.\n\nNoting the pressure on Akpabio, another source had said, \"Don't forget he has tons of corruption cases with the EFCC right from when he was a governor. And now with NDDC scams in billions, he is under a lot of pressure.\n\n\"When Akpabio was released, he called Malami, who had arranged his meeting with the EFCC chairmen, frantically asking him to drive to the EFCC office to explain to Bawa that he didn\u2019t mean to cause him any harm by bribing him but Malami said he was sick.\n\n\"Malami told him he had just returned from Turkey after which he travelled to Sokoto and collapsed in public.\"\n\nSaharaReporters had on April 15, 2021reported how Malami collapsed in Sokoto state while he was there for the inauguration of the reconstructed State High Court complex by Governor Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nMalami had collapsed after delivering his address at the ceremony and was quickly revived by his aides and dignitaries.\n\nHe was subsequently hospitalised at a private facility upon his return to Abuja.",

          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong has called for the immediate release of an advert agent, Baron Nnamdi, arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over \"offensive campaign messages\".\n\nThe anti-graft agency earlier on Sunday said it had arrested an outdoor advertisement executive over political advertisements that appeared on two billboards in Enugu bearing the name and logo of the Commission.\n\nThe arrest was made on Saturday, according to the agency.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Sunday, Effiong said apart from releasing Nnamdi immediately, the agency should also apologise to him and compensate him.\n\nEffiong said Nnamdi had done nothing wrong.\n\nHe said, \"I call on the Commission to immediately release the advertisement executive, publicly apologise to him, and pay him adequate compensation for the malicious damage to his billboards. The Commission should arrest the corrupt politicians in Enugu State and the rest of the country who are using stolen public funds to promote their insatiable political campaigns and ambitions.\n\n\"This is needless persecution and distraction. If the Bawa-led EFCC is now officially supporting corrupt candidates and politicians, the Commission should say so without equivocation. The advert is commendable, and the Concerned Enugu Citizens who sponsored it should be commended by the EFCC and the public.\"\n\nThe billboard message the EFCC described as offensive had read thus: \u201c2023: ENUGU PDP LEARN FROM 2007 ELECTION. EFCC IS COMING WITH KOBOKO ON CORRUPT CANDIDATES.\u201d\n\nSee Also CRIME Nigerian Anti-graft Agency, EFCC Arrests Advert Executive Over 'Offensive Campaign Adverts' With Its Logo In Enugu\n\nEffiong, in his disagreement with the anti-graft agency further said, \"In the statement, the Commission claims that the advertisement executive was arrested because of the two billboards that bore the name and logo of the Commission. The Commission also claims that the billboards 'bore offensive messages', and that it was used to 'threaten the aspiration of some politicians in the state in the build-up to the 2023 general elections.'\n\n\"The reasons given by the EFCC for their action, in this case, are baseless, false and legally unfounded. The use of the logo or name of the EFCC is in itself not a criminal offence. There is no Section of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004 that makes the mere use of the name or logo of the EFCC, without more, a criminal offence.\n\n\"Section 6 (q) of the EFCC Act provides for the functions of the Commission which includes: 'carrying out and sustaining rigorous public and enlightenment campaign against economic and financial crimes within and outside Nigeria.'\n\n\"By Section 24 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), citizens have a constitutional duty to assist law enforcement agencies in the discharge of their functions. Thus, the Commission should encourage, and not penalise or persecute citizens, who engage in rigorous public enlightenment campaigns against economic and financial crimes. There is no doubt that the message on the billboards is geared toward discouraging economic and financial crimes. In essence, the Concerned Enugu Citizens in Scotland who sponsored the adverts are only discharging their constitutional duty. The message on the billboards is patriotic and timely.\n\nWhat offence has the advertisement executive committed to warrant his arrest by the EFCC? Those who are saying that the advert amounts to the impersonation of the EFCC are wrong. Those who hold this erroneous view should be properly guided on the elements of the offence of impersonation. For the offence of impersonation to be constituted in law, there has to be a criminal intent (mens rea).\n\n\"Section 484 of the Criminal Code Act specifically defines impersonation in general as follows: 'Any person who, with intent to defraud any person, falsely represents himself to be some other person, living or dead, is guilty of a felony and is liable to imprisonment for three years.'\n\n\"In the billboards, it is clearly written that the advert is sponsored (powered) by' Concerned Enugu Citizens in Scotland.' It is therefore illegal, mischievous and ridiculous for the EFCC to arrest the advertisement executive despite the apparent fact that the advert is not credited to the EFCC or any officer of the Commission. There was no intent whatsoever to defraud any person. There is nothing in the billboards that warrants the obnoxious arrest of the advert executive or anyone for that matter.\n\n\"The abbreviation 'EFCC' is not a registered trademark of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Even if it were a registered trademark, the unauthorised use of same should be seen as a trademark infringement which is a civil wrong and not a criminal offence. Any citizen can legally use the abbreviation or acronym 'EFCC' for a legal and legitimate purpose.\n\n\"Similarly, the use of the EFCC\u2019s logo is not a criminal offence, except where it is used with criminal intent.\n\n\"Let the Commission refer Nigerians to any Section of the EFCC (Establishment) Act, 2004 that criminalises the use of the logo or name of the Commission for public enlightenment purpose by citizens. If such prohibition existed, movie producers for example who constantly use the name and logo of the EFCC for enlightenment or artistic and entertainment purposes would be liable to prosecution.\n\n\"In law, it takes more than a physical act (actus reus) for a crime to be committed. There must be mens rea (criminal mind or criminal intent). These two elements must coexist. This is in accordance with Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution which states that no person shall be punished except for the offence and the punishment for same is expressly defined in a written law.\n\n\u201c'Offensive EFCC Campaign Adverts' as alluded to by the EFCC is not an offence known to law in Nigeria. The message in the advert is positive; it promotes the 'war' against corruption that the EFCC is supposed to be waging. It is rather ironic that the same EFCC that claims to be investigating politicians regarding the source of the humongous sums they are using to buy nomination forms is now antagonising patriotic citizens who are warning corrupt politicians to be mindful of the same EFCC.\n\nThe claim by the Commission that the billboards were used to threaten the aspirations of 'some politicians in the state' is false and misleading. The message on the billboards was specifically targeted at corrupt candidates and politicians. There is nowhere on the billboards where the name of any particular candidate or politician was mentioned.\n\n\"It is therefore astonishing, that a Commission that is statutorily mandated to fight corruption, is now holding brief for corrupt politicians in Enugu State. No matter how we look at it, this action by the EFCC is a setback on the war against corruption and should be roundly condemned.\"",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nHow are you doing? How has your week been? No, I\u2019m not being clich\u00e9.

Also, engage my newsletter by leaving your thoughts and encouraging others to subscribe. Promise to do it? Pinky swear? I believe you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo, I\u2019m excited today, and you know why! \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a Tomorrow is the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Africa Summit (TABS)! Well, honestly, it\u2019s been a stressful week for the Techpoint Africa team. But, you know what? It\u2019s over already. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve registered, you\u2019ll see all the fantastic things we\u2019ve packaged just for you tomorrow. However, all tickets, including giveaways, are sold out.\n\nSo, prepare your NFT and web3 questions. You also don\u2019t want to miss the exhibition booth, networking, and the hackathon\u2019s grand finale. You\u2019re excited too, aren\u2019t you? \ud83d\ude09 I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n\nIf you do not have a ticket to the physical event, you can register online for free here.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\nNetflix\u2019s Mystery Box\n\nTikTok\u2019s plan to credit creators\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory Farms, a Kenyan-based startup, has raised $5 million in new funding.\n\nEd Brakeman, a senior managing director at Bain Capital and Hans den Bieman, Founder and ex-CEO of Mowi, a company that claims to be one of the world\u2019s largest salmon businesses, led the investment.\n\nLaunched in 2015 by Joseph Rehmann (CEO), Victory Farms is a tilapia aquaculture startup and farm with hatcheries, nursery ponds, and deep-water cages.\n\nThe company claims to have grown twice as fast as any other African fish company. Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up. You\u2019re asking me why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know that YouTube can identify the most replayed parts of your video? This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days! Are you ready?\n\nMARA is giving away 20 tickets to attend Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit.

To win, follow the instructions here.\n\nBesides, online tickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBamba, a mobile-based enterprise software for African micro-merchants, has raised $3.2 million in seed funding to scale its app and expand its team.\n\nThe round was led by 468 Capital, with participation from Presight Ventures, Jigsaw VC, and high-profile angel investors, Mato Peric, Leonard Stiegeler, Laurin Hainy, and Thomas Stafford.\n\nBastian Gotter (CEO) founded Bamba in 2022 as a mobile application company. The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxation is not a subject that Nigerians want to talk about, but the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is about to make it unavoidable. Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

          "title": "Why there\u2019s mass defection to NNPP \u2013 Party chairman",
          "text": "Rufai Ahmed Alkali, national chairman of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), has said many politicians have defected to the party because it is a better alternative to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAlkali said this while welcoming, on behalf of the NNPP National Working Committee, a former Kano State governor and serving Senator, Ibrahim Shekarau to the party.\n\nShekarau recently joined the NNPP from the APC. The development happened a few days after Abdulmumin Jibrin, a former member of the House of Representatives and director-general of the Bola Tinubu Campaign Group, joined the party.\n\nThe duo\u2019s defection and that of others came despite efforts by Abdullahi Ganduje, Kano governor, to prevent them from leaving the APC.\n\nBefore the latest defections, at least 17 members of the Kano State House of Assembly and Ganduje\u2019s chief of staff had left the PDP and the APC to the NNPP.\n\nReacting to the defections, Alkali said: \u201cThey are pointers to the fact the NNPP has become the party to beat, not just in Kano State but all over the country.\n\n\u201cSenator Ibrahim Shekarau\u2019s movement to our party, as well as other movements, in various parts of the country, has now changed the permutations and political alignment in the country ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cRecall that before the emergence and sudden growth of the NNPP, PDP was hitherto considered as the main opposition party in Kano and other parts of the country and was expected to provide a formidable competition to the APC in 2023 as it did in 2019.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut with the PDP and APC engrossed with leadership problems, our party has become the precious bride being sought after by many politicians across the country.\n\n\u201cUnlike in 2019, the political calculation in 2023 will be a different ball game. This is because we have taken far reaching steps to re-launch and reposition the party as one of the major political parties in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alkali, given the massive support the party has received and continued to receive from people across the country, it is optimistic that very soon it would move from its current ranking as the \u2018third force\u2019 to the top in Nigeria\u2019s political space.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo far, we have successfully conducted ward congresses in all the local government areas across the country. The local government congress, state congress and national convention were also conducted peacefully.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore bold to say that our presence is now felt in all the 774 local government areas as Nigerians continue to embrace our party.\u201d\n\nAccording to the party chairman, the NNPP is the only party in Nigeria that has offered youths below 35 years of age a 50 percent discount for the purchase of nomination forms.\n\nRead also: 2023 Presidency: Kwankwaso, north\u2019s joker, set to emerge NNPP consensus candidate\n\nHe said: \u201cThis has led to an influx of youths to the party, and the party is equal to the task as it has put in place all measures to avoid rancour during the election.\n\n\u201cIt is not in doubt that Nigerians are tired and are therefore looking for a better option. Happily, with the calibre of people joining our party such as Senator Shekarau, the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party is today that new option that Nigerians have been yearning and waiting for. And we promise Nigerians that we shall do everything possible to ensure that every Nigerian is carried along. This party is all about correcting past and current mistakes done by the APC and PDP and with your support, we shall achieve a better Nigeria, and very soon it shall be the number-one force in the country.\u201d\n\nThe party has announced a shift in the dates for its senatorial and governorship primaries.\n\nAccording to Dipo Olayoku, the national secretary of the party and chairman convention planning committee, the action was taken by the party leadership to ensure transparent and hitch-free primaries/elections\n\nIt said in a statement: \u201cThe National Working Committee, at its Emergency meeting on Thursday, May 19, 2022, approved the shift in dates for the senatorial and governorship primaries.\n\n\u201cFor the Senate, all the processes will take place in the states, while for the governorship, only the primaries slated for Monday, May 30 will take place at the states while the other processes will take place in Abuja. For the states in the South-East, because of the sit-at- home order on Mondays, any programme fixed for Mondays will be held on Tuesdays.\u201d\n\nThe NNPP urged all members to cooperate with the primaries/elections committees in the interest of the party.",

          "title": "OECD\u2019s corporate tax plan not in Nigeria\u2019s interests \u2013 FIRS",
          "text": "Nigeria will not be endorsing a framework for what was called a two-pillar solution to the taxation of the digital economy, promoted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)/ G20 Inclusive. This was disclosed in a press statement by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), which says the proposal is not in the best interest of the country, and wants to \u201censure that Nigeria does not lose out on potential revenue from the digital economy\u201d.\n\nIn a statement issued on behalf of Muhammad Nami, executive chairman of FIRS, it was disclosed that the conditions of the agreement were reviewed, and it threw up concerns over the impact that the signing of the agreement would have on the country\u2019s tax system and tax revenue generation.\n\n\u201cThere are serious concerns on how the rules would compound the issues in our tax system. For instance, to be able to tax any digital sale or any multinational enterprise (MNEs), that company or enterprise must have an annual global turnover of \u20ac20 billion and a global profitability of 10%. That is a concern. This is because most MNEs that operate in our country do not meet such criteria and we would not be able to tax them,\u201d read the statement.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the \u20ac20 billion global annual turnover in question is not just for one accounting year, but it is that the enterprise must make \u20ac20 billion revenue and 10% profitability in average for four consecutive years, otherwise that enterprise will never pay tax in our country, but in the country where the enterprise comes from, or its country of residence,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThirdly it was noted that for Nigeria to subject a Multinational Enterprise to tax under the rule, the entity must have generated at least \u20ac1 million turnover from Nigeria within a year.\n\nThis, the FIRS says is an unfair position, especially to domestic companies which, with a minimum of above N25 million (that is about \u20ac57,000) turnover, are subject to company\u2019s income tax in Nigeria. He added that this rule will take off so many Multinational Enterprises from the scope of those that are currently paying taxes to Nigeria.\n\nIn other words, even the MNEs that are currently paying taxes in Nigeria would cease to pay taxes to the country because of this rule.\n\nFourthly, on the issue of dispute resolutions under the Two-Pillar Solution, it was noted in the event of a dispute between Nigeria and a Multinational Enterprise, Nigeria would be subject to an international arbitration panel as against Nigeria\u2019s own justice system.\n\n\u201cIt would be subject to international arbitration and not Nigeria\u2019s judicial system and laws\u2014even where the income is directly related to a Nigerian member of an MNE group, which is ordinarily subject to tax in Nigeria on its worldwide income and subject to the laws of Nigeria.\n\nWe are concerned about getting a fair deal from such process. More so, such a dispute resolution process with a Multinational Enterprise, in an international arbitration panel outside the country, would lead to heavy expenses on legal services, traveling and other incidental costs.\n\n\u201cNigeria would spend more; even beyond the tax yield from such cases,\u201d the statement read.\n\nOn the issue of Nigeria loosing significant revenue if it fails to sign into the OECD Inclusive Framework rules for the taxation of the digital economy, the statement said this was not a problem as the country had already put forward four ongoing solutions to the challenge of taxation of the digital economy.\n\nAccording to the statement, it is already a point of practice to annually amend the country\u2019s tax laws to reflect the current global realities, and it was courtesy of these reviews that the Significant Economic Presence (SEP) rule was developed, through the Finance Act of 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe SEP rules set threshold for Multinational Enterprises, without physical presence in Nigeria, for registration and payment of taxes to the country.\n\nRead also: Time to consider wealth taxation in Nigeria\n\nAlso, technology has been deployed in bringing digital transactions to the tax net. Coupled with the Significant Economic Presence rule, FIRS says it has started seeing the impact of the technology deployed; companies like Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, LinkedIn, among others who have no physical presence in Nigeria and that were hitherto not paying taxes have now registered for tax purposes and are paying taxes accordingly.\n\nThere is also the Data-4-Tax Initiative, a blockchain technology which FIRS is jointly developing with the Internal Revenue Service of the 36 states and that of the FCT, under the auspices of the Joint Tax Board. With this project, FIRS says it is confident of a seamless view and access to all economic activities of individuals and corporate bodies in Nigeria going forward, including money spent on digital commerce.\n\n\u201cThe fourth is that we have set up a specialised office, the Non-Resident Persons Tax Office, to manage the taxation of non-resident persons and cross-border transactions, including all tax treaty operational issues and income derived from Nigeria by non-resident individuals and companies,\u201d the statement read.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Executive Chairman, FIRS appreciates members of the Nigerian public who had raised concerns at various occasions over Nigeria\u2019s decision not to endorse the Two-Pillar solution, stating that their concerns came from a place of genuine passion and patriotism, anchored on seeking a better Nigeria.",

          "title": "APC, PDP primaries: Other parties set to reap from likely defections",
          "text": "Considering the too many aspirants across the two major political parties; the All Progressive Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), and the feelers that certain politicians were already complaining of alleged form of injustice within their parties, some observers say that the primaries of the two major parties may ruffle some feathers, leading to defections.\n\nMoreover, some of those who paid N100 million to get the nomination forms for the APC and N40 million for the PDP, who may have reasons to feel betrayed are likely to take drastic measures to vent their frustration.\n\nSome of them are expected to seek soft landing in other parties. There is also the impression in some quarters that some of the opposition parties are only relevant as placeholders for politicians who hope to use their platforms once they lose out in the ruling APC and the main opposition PDP.\n\nSome believe that these parties are owned and managed by political contractors who are only after what they would get from candidates who may have lost out in the two major parties and want to use their platform to contest elections.\n\nA vivid example is the recent case of the movement of the ex-governor of Ekiti State, Segun Oni, to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) after he lost at the PDP governorship primary in the state.\n\nAnother example is the recent defection of former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, with his loyalists from the PDP to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nThere are also rumours that several leading politicians in the two major parties have concluded arrangements with smaller opposition parties to pick their ticket if they lose out in the primaries.\n\nLanre Oshungboye, a chieftain of the Accord Party in Lagos State, said the defection of politicians to lesser opposition parties has always been because of imposition of candidate on them by party leaders, wondering why a popular aspirant would stay back and watch his political ambition truncated when he had popular support.\n\nAccording to him ,\u201dDefinitely, we all know for a fact that politics is a game of numbers; when a candidate is convinced and believes he has the number to challenge the establishment, why stay back where they will impose a preferred candidate on you?\n\n\u201cIn politics, there is no permanent friend or foe, but permanent interest. If your interest is no longer protected in a political party, nothing stops you from actualising it on another platform.\u201d\n\nChijioke Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, who is aspiring for a seat at the Arochukwu/Ohaofia Federal Constituency, lamented that because of the about 150 percent increase in the nomination fee for the House of Representatives in the PDP, many have defected to APGA, which is equally a formidable force in the Eastern part of the country.\n\n\u201cI cannot dare the APC form because it is out of reach and my constituency favours PDP. Many of us are waiting for the primaries, if we fail, there is enough room in APGA,\u201d the aspirant said.\n\nThe former lawmaker and lawyer also hinted that a top PDP presidential aspirant has an understanding with APGA, to run under the party if the primaries did not favour him.\n\nIn the same vein, Onyemdi Ikpeama, a senior lecturer at Abia State University Uturu, and former student union activist, expressed the view that implosion was looming, not just in the two major parties, but also in other parties that will be sacrificing loyalty of their staunch members for selfish interests of moneybags who will pay to get their presidential tickets.\n\n\u201cI see implosion because our politicians are very selfish and ready to do anything or pay any amount to remain in the corridors of power. So, if Atiku loses out in PDP, he has plan B. We all know Tinubu\u2019s plan B. So, implosion is sure and it will enrich lesser known parties,\u201d Ikpeama said.\n\nPundits also say that considering the calibre and influence of Rabi\u2019u Musa Kwankwaso and Ibrahim Shekarau in some parts of the north, their activities in the NNPP could attract defectors from APC and PDP, who the primaries did not favour.\n\nAlso, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is rumoured to be Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019s plan B to secure a presidential ticket, will become the new APC in the South West if Tinubu loses at the APC primaries and decides to run under SDP.\n\nWith the look of things, observers say that the NNPP, SDP and APGA are the parties that are going to reap the most from the implosion in APC and PDP after the primaries this May.\n\nSpeaking to BusinessDay, Rufai Ahmed Alkali, a professor and national chairman of the NNPP, explained why the party may have become a beautiful bride.\n\n\u201cThe NNPP is the only party in Nigeria that has offered the youths less than 35 years of age fifty percent discount for the purchase of nomination forms. This has led to an influx of youths to the party and the party is equal to the task as it has put in place all measures to avoid rancour during the election,\u201d Alkali said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is not in doubt that Nigerians are tired and are therefore looking for a better option. Happily, with the caliber people joining our party such as Senator Shekarau, the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party is today that new option that Nigerians have been yearning and waiting for. And we promise Nigerians that we shall do everything possible to ensure that every Nigerian is carried along. This party is all about correcting past and current mistakes done by the APC and PDP and with your support, we shall achieve a better Nigeria and very soon it shall be the number one force in the country.\u201d\n\nFredrice Uyigue, Edo South senatorial vice chairman of the NNPP, said the party has a formidable structure and it is equipped to compete favourably with the other two parties.\n\nUyigue opined that the NNPP is a better solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems, adding that the party would project a presidential candidate who is qualified to deliver the dividends of democracy that the people have been yearning for since 1999.\n\n\u201cIt is only the best that can give us hope of deliverance and prosperity in our society. We cannot keep pushing up mediocre or be nepotistic in the choices of people to lead us. Both parties who have been in power are one and the same, and they keep criss-crossing.\n\n\u201cDisaffection is bound to happen among members of those parties, and many will come to our party. We will welcome them, but we will also demand some quality and assurances that they will not bring their bad practices from their old party to ours.\n\n\u201cWe set a different agenda from the beginning, which is different from the other parties. NNPP has repositioned itself to respond to the inadequacies of the other parties,\u201d Uyigue said.\n\nMarvis Osagie, a Benin resident, told BusinessDay that, \u201cMost of these top aspirants have seen the signs already that they may be disqualified and, as such, will grab the opportunity if given the chance to defect to another party so as to fulfill their political ambitions.\n\n\u201cIn the past few days, we have seen some developments among some parties, and it is glaring that a merger is possible so they can field a stronger candidate who will become a third force to the likes of the APC and the PDP,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: 2023: Political atmosphere hots up as PDP, APC elect presidential candidates consecutively\n\nThe limitation\n\nBut, this will not be a smooth ride as observers say the aggrieved defectors and their party may be challenged with the onerous task of dislodging the existing structure of the APC and that of the PDP within a short time frame.\n\nSome pundits say that the \u201csmaller\u201d opposition parties would continue to find it difficult to win election, because most of them have no grassroots presence and are often not prepared for major elections.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe you are referring to SDP and NNPP as the parties that would reap from any implosion in the leading parties, but this might not really have adverse effect on the chances of the APC and PDP in retaining their position as the leading political parties in the 2023 race.\n\n\u201cThe smaller parties don\u2019t have structure; do you know the secretariat of any of them in Lagos? They only come and set up a place when the election is approaching, that is why, even if the big politicians defect to contest there, they may not win.\n\n\u201cYes, APC may likely implode but any faction or group that moves to another party may not really make any headway in the long run on,\u201d Kunle Okunade, political analyst, said.\n\nOkunade added that he does not expect any significant implosion in the two major parties, especially the PDP ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cFor now, it is obvious that the expected implosion may not occur in PDP based on what is going on in the party, which looks like the leaders would settle for an agreed terms.\n\n\u201cWe may not experience the effect of the 2014 implosion in PDP, in this coming election because those that would be affected would be minority in the party.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLast week, our organisation organized a 2-day seminar for CSOs and journalists on enhancing advocacy skills on anti-corruption and social inclusive reform issues in Nigeria. It was tagged Enhancing Anti-corruption and Social Inclusive Reform Initiatives in Nigeria. It is designed to enhance local civil society organizations\u2019 ability to be positive and responsible change agents in Nigeria.\n\nThe Enhancing Anti-corruption and Social Inclusive Reform Initiatives in Nigeria project is designed following the anchor cluster model adopted by Palladium to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms. This project works with us as \u2018anchor\u2019 organisation working with 8 cluster member organizations spread across six states and the Federal Capital Territory. The States are Abia, Edo, Delta, Imo, Ondo, Rivers and the FCT, Abuja. ANEEJ is working with the eight cluster members located in these states including the FCT to implement and deliver this project.\n\nThe cluster organisations are: 21st Century Community Empowerment for youth and Women Initiative, Abuja; Community Empowerment and Development Initiative (CEDI), Warri, Delta State; Community Heritage Watch for Development Initiative, (KAI) Akure, Ondo State; Christian Fellowship and Care Foundation (CFCF), Owerri, Imo State; Foundation for Environmental Rights, Advocacy and Development (FENRAD), Aba, Abia State; Gender and Development Action (GADA) Port-Harcourt, Rivers State; Joint Association of Persons with Disability (JONAPWD) Edo State Chapter; and New Apostolic Church Centre for Development (NCD), Benin City, Edo State.\n\nWe consider this project as an important one that seeks to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms at both the national and sub-national levels with an ultimate goal of strengthening governance to deliver development goals to citizens, particularly in addressing poverty and inequality amongst our people.\n\nIt will interest you to know that aside the anti-corruption component, the project is also designed to address reforms as well as issues of transparency and accountability in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and six oil and gas producing states \u2013 Abia, Delta, Edo, Imo, Rivers and Ondo. This explains why participation and cluster members were drawn from these states.\n\nDuring the course of implementing this project, interventions will include advocacy for passage/adoption of pending Anti-Corruption Bills, the National Anti-corruption Strategy (NACS II) and the NDDC Act Amendment Bill currently before the national assembly. The project will also support oversight and implementation of the Nigeria\u2019s International anti-corruption/asset recovery commitments; Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commissions among others. Our cluster currently advocates for the mainstreaming of anti-corruption issues into the country upcoming 2023 general elections discourse. Some of which are already ongoing as CSOs jointly called on political aspirants to mainstream issues of anti-corruption in the upcoming general elections during the learning event held in Benin City in April. If you watched Good morning show on NTA last Tuesday, I spoke extensively about addressing corruption issues during elections, we must move away from the culture and norms that promote corruption and create incentive for those who are not willing to buy votes, induce voters and rig elections.\n\nAs you know, the Proceeds of Crime Bill (POCA) has just been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari which gives a working instrument for the anti-corruption agencies like the EFCC, ICPC and CCB to work collaboratively and solve corruption problems in Nigeria. Since POCA has been passed and accented to, there are others on the queue such as the Whistleblower Protection Bill and the Witness Protection Bill. We should work together to see how our collective effort can result in the passage of these bills and others.\n\nThe two-day workshop is specifically designed for CSOs and journalists from the project benefiting States. We want to see how to enhance your advocacy skills on some of the issues highlighted above and others necessary to advance anti-corruption reforms in Nigeria as well as drive transparency and accountability in management of oil revenues accruing to oil producing states.\n\nAfter the workshop, we want to see change agents from among us here, who, with the right knowledge having been trained can use the acquired knowledge to hold government accountable, advocate and push for reforms and the passage of other relevant pending anti-corruption bills. This is particularly important because the project is hinged on the premix that when CSOs and journalists are trained on anti-corruption and social inclusive reforms issues, and they have the right knowledge and skills to engage government collaboratively based on existing data, they will be able to carry out evidence-based advocacy for reforms. Then, they can also influence the development of policies, passage of laws on anti-corruption and social inclusive reforms issues. This is what we aim to achieve with this two-days training and at the end, develop advocacy plan to support the passage of pending anti-corruption bills and other anti-corruption and social inclusive reform issues.\n\nI urge Nigerians to participate with keen interest in these issues to put us all on track of the current political economic analysis and how we can collaboratively engage relevant stakeholders at both national and state levels to drive key reforms.\n\n_______________\n\nRev Ugolor is Executive director ANEEJ.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are fully aware, the way you handle the National Assembly, the House of Representatives and the Senate, which you are the chairman.\n\n\u201cIf we can recall with nostalgia what happened between 2015 and 2019, we are all living witnesses that we had a lot of instability, poor relationship between the Legislature and the Executive.\n\n\u201cInfact, we had a situation where, in one day, 15 Senators from APC defected to PDP from the Senate Chamber. Your Excellency, I\u2019m saying all these things in order to show your political dexterity in managing the National Assembly, in managing the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature.\n\n\u201cToday there is peace, cordial relationship between the Executive and the Legislature and we believe if you become the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, we can expect peace and stability between the Legislature and the Executive, with the Institutions of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, with the sub-national government in the states, with the Local Governments.\n\n\u201cSo Your Excellency we assure you of our full cooperation. Kano state is a swing state in the Presidential primaries, even in the Presidential election and Kano state will swing when it is time to swing.\u201d\n\nGanduje dwelled in what made Kano so important in the political calculations of Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cKano state has the largest number of delegates in the country. There is no gainsaying about that. This follows from the fact that we have the largest population in the country.\n\n\u201cSo Your Excellency, this state is a very important state when issues of elections are concerned.\n\n\u201cWe have 44 Local Governments, 484 wards. All our local government council chairmen are elected local government chairmen. Therefore, they are part of the statutory delegates in Kano state and in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have over 4,000 elected councillors in Kano state. And most of our 400 legislators especially House of Representatives, Senators, former Senators, principal officers of the state Assembly and National Assembly, Your Excellency, both of them, we are together and we are intact.\n\n\u201cSo you can see the composition of our delegation, not only in terms of number but in terms of quality, in terms of capacity, in terms of capability and in terms of political dexterity.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the forum which held at the Coronation Hall of the Kano state government House, Lawan said his mission was to interact with the party delegates on his presidential bid ahead of the primaries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to see and interact with all the 500 delegates from Kano state and I cannot agree more with my leader when he said this is the largest sub-national democracy in Nigeria. I imagine that it could also be the largest sub-national democracy in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhen His Excellency, our Governor was rounding up his speech, he said Kano is a swing state and it can determine not only the Primaries, with 500 delegates, but also the general elections. Your Excellency, it will swing to my side by the Grace of God.\n\n\u201cI want all the 500 delegates. Infact I need all the 500 delegates Your Excellency. If I can\u2019t have the 500, please let me have at least 400.\n\n\u201cMy brothers and sisters, distinguished delegates, I promise you that, when eventually we discuss and find common ground with His Excellency and vote for me, you will for ever be pleased with the way and manner I will lead this country because it is not possible for anyone to lead the country like Nigeria without the presence and contributions of people like Governor Abdullahi Ganduje,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe Senate President thanked Governor Ganduje for the warmth reception and commended him for his achievements in Kano both in security, governance and party politics.\n\n\u201cI want to commend His Excellency, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje for the infrastructural miracle in Kano state. You have done so much Your Excellency. You have secured Kano state from banditry, from insurgency and so on. You are indeed a leader, a very successful one at that.\n\n\u201cNo amount of propaganda will convince or confuse anyone that Kano is shaking at all. APC in Kano is steady, solid like a rock.\n\n\u201cCome 2023, by the Grace of God, we will have an APC governor and his deputy, all our three Senators will be APC, all the 24 members of the House of Representatives will be APC, all the 40 members of the state House of Assembly will be voted in by the Grace of God. They(opposition parties) will not have anything,\u201d Lawan said.",

It will also lead to a plethora of endless litigation afterwards.\u201d\n\nSome of the aspirants in the race who stormed the venue of the press briefing, urged the leadership of the party in the state to put their house in order because they are at the receiving end of the power game being played by the leaders of the party.\n\nGovernorship aspirants in attendanceat the briefing included Dr. Ade Dosunmu, Engineer Deji Doherty, Jimi Kamal and Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour.",

          "text": "\n\n\u2026says \u2018award is a challenge to impact more on humanity\u2019\n\nIn recognition of his achievements and outstanding performance in office, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun, on Friday night, received yet another award, as he was crowned the Vanguard Newspapers\u2019 Governor of The Year 2021 for Good Governance.\n\nHe received the award at a colourful event tagged \u2018Vanguard Personality of the Year 2021 Award\u2019 which held at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos.\n\nRecall that Oyetola had in the recent past won the Business Day Best Governor of the Year award, Blueprint Newspaper Governor of the Year, DAAR Communications Outstanding Leader in Governance, Nigerian NewsDirect 2021 Best Governor of the Year and Man of the Year award, among others.\n\nThe governor described his latest award as a challenge to impact more on humanity just as he dedicated it to the people of Osun for giving him the opportunity to prove that governance can be done better with utmost fear of God and for the sake of humanity.\n\nAccording to the management of the Vanguard Newspapers, the choice of Governor Oyetola for the Good Governance award was basically on empirical facts and indisputable statistics on the geometric transformation that Osun and her people had witnessed under his watch since assumption of office.\n\nIt explained that the philosophy of the award is to recognise and celebrate excellence, national pride and service to humanity.\n\n\u201cSince assumption of office you have delivered the dividends of democracy without loans. It is on record that you have prudently managed available resources while your Administration has kept faith with the people and maintained fidelity with your electoral promises.\n\n\u201cWe also noted the crisis in the education sector and how brilliantly the Governor has resolved it. One other thing we have seen is the character of Mr. Governor: no crisis, no rancour. In fact, we have seen the highest level of decorum in governance.\n\n\u201cGenerally, this nomination for the award of Governor of the Year for Good Governance is actually an encouragement award on how the Governor has raised the pedestal of governance for the people of Osun and beyond,\u201d the award organisers added.\n\nSpeaking shortly after receiving the award, Governor Oyetola thanked the management of the Vanguard Newspaper for recognising the modest achievements his administration had made to transform Osun. He dedicated the award to the people of the State for giving him the opportunity to serve them.\n\nOyetola said: \u201cI am highly elated to accept this award of Governor of the Year for Good Governance by one of the nation\u2019s frontline and integrity-savvy newspapers. This a reward for hardwork and I accept it wholeheartedly.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, good governance in itself answers to unblemished demonstrable service to the people and its factors for service are economic buoyancy, transparent and inclusive governance, equitable service delivery and political will; and all are seemingly mutually inclusive.\n\n\u201cHowever, achieving good governance and winning nomination in a depressed economy in a country where some of the competitors are way richer than us, makes our story somewhat different.\n\n\u201cWe came in when no one gave us a chance. We inherited a financially challenged State and one that could not pay its bills. We were however resolved to make a difference. And the difference we have so far made through prudent management of resources, including plugging waste and cutting costs.\n\n\u201cThrough creative and innovative alternative project funding, we have built and rehabilitated roads that had been abandoned for three decades or more.\n\n\u201cOur service distribution is anchored on quality and equitable service delivery. From infrastructure to health and education, security to welfare, projects and service have been equitably distributed to all the wards in the nine Federal Constituencies and three Senatorial Districts of the State.\n\n\u201cIn these three and a half years that we have been in the saddle, we have proved as a government that good governance and service delivery is possible in a depressed economy; that we can execute projects without borrowing; that we can look inward to pay salaries.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over three and a half years in government building a solid foundation for a sustainable economy. The remaining years shall be spent to build bricks that will deliver a strong and prosperous Osun and a happy and productive people. This is our mission in government. This is the least we owe our people.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, dedicate this award to our people wherever they are, for giving us the opportunity to prove that governance can be done better with utmost fear of God and for the sake of humanity.\n\n\u201cTo the staff and management of Vanguard Newspapers, we thank you for recognising our modest achievements as we continue to keep our eyes on the ball. We appreciate you for giving us this award to encourage us to do more\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of the occasion and former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Obong Victor Attah, lauded the leadership of the newspaper for promoting excellence, hard-work, competence, integrity and character through it daily reportorial and yearly award of excellence.\n\nAttah also charged Oyetola and other awardees to continue to be the source of inspiration and perfect examples for those behind.\n\nOther award recipients are: Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun; Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki; Nasarawa State Governor, Alhaji Abdullahi Sule; Gombe State Governor, Muhammed Inuwa Yahaya, foremost Legal Luminary, Aare Afe Babalola among others.\n\nGovernor Oyetola was accompanied to the event by his wife, Mrs. Kafayat, his children, Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye, Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, Chief of Staff, Dr. Charles Akinola, Finance Commissioner, Bola Oyebamiji, Information Commissioner, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, former member of House of Representatives, Hon.

Okorocha\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 reads: \u201cThat the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the All Progressives Congress and its National Working Committee as well as the teaming members of the party are commended by the entire people of the South-east on their avowed commitment to the unity of Nigeria and the inclusion of all parts of Nigeria in the governance architecture of the country.\n\n\u201cThat we commend all Nigerians who are committed to the Nigerian project by the whole hearted support of the aspiration of the South-east to produce the next Nigerian president in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat in furtherance of this commitment, all aspirants here commit to align with any of the South-east aspirants that is accepted by and chosen by other Nigerians to fly the APC flag.\u201d\n\n\u2026Bankole too\n\nTowing similar line, another presidential aspirant and former Speaker House of Representatives Bankole, called for the adoption of \u201cmodified consensus\u201d as the preferred method for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nAddressing newsmen Sunday in Abuja, the aspirant said, \u201cmodified consensus\u201d remained the best approach and least costly option for the emergence of the party\u2019s flag bearer.\n\nAccording to Bankole, the modified consensus option would see the leadership of the party engaging with the various interest groups in the contest to ensure a hitch-free nomination process.\n\n\u201cConsensus is not the same thing as imposition,\u201d Bankole declared, noting that the current opposition to the consensus arrangement in some quarters may be because \u201cconsensus is being erroneously equated with imposition.\u201d\n\nHe argued that there was a need to lay the anxieties of people currently opposed to the consensus arrangement to rest.\n\nBy embarking on widespread consultations with all interested groups and tendencies in the party, the leadership, he said, would allay all fears concerning the consensus option.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the APC itself was a product of consensus,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cat critical points in the history of Nigeria, consensus had been used to break political logjams.\u201d\n\nHe cited, in particular, the adoption of the \u201cDoctrine of Necessity\u201d during the illness of late President Umar Yar\u2019Adua as a perfect example of the consensus option.\n\nThe former lawmaker also added that the consensus option was adopted in the emergence of the current APC national chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nGiven the heightened national interest in the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate and frenetic jostling by various groups, Bankole averred that \u201cit is incumbent on the leadership of the party to adopt a method that ensures that the party can go to the 2023 elections as a united and formidable entity.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker concluded that he had \u201cimplicit and unalloyed\u201d confidence in the ability of the party leadership to do what is right towards ensuring a united front towards the elections and eventual victory at the 2023 polls.\n\nBuhari holds the ace \u2013 Zulum\n\nAlso weighing in on how best to produce the party\u2019s flag bearer, Governor Zulum said President Muhammadu Buhari would have the final say on who emerges the choice of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThe governor disclosed this Sunday in Maiduguri while receiving in audience the Rotimi Amaechi campaign team, led by its Director General, Senator Ali Ndume.\n\nAlso on the campaign team were a former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Yusuf Buratai (retd.), and former Inspector-General of Police, Abba Suleiman among others.\n\nThe governor told the aspirant that Borno delegates had no preferred aspirant at the moment, adding however that the delegates would vote a credible candidate based on the preference of the president and their convictions.\n\nHe said: \u201cBorno state delegates will vote based on their conscience. But again, our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, is very important in this political equation. We are still waiting for him to tell us what to do and we will follow. His advice is very important so we have to wait for his advice.\n\n\u201cNigerians should pray for a good candidate to emerge irrespective of tribe, region or ethnic background; a candidate that will ensure the APC forms the central government come 2023.\u201d\n\nAddressing the delegates, Mr Amaechi urged the state delegates to support his aspiration so he could bring an end to insurgency and all forms of insecurity across the country.\n\nAmaechi said he brought about peace, safety, security and stability being enjoyed today in Rivers state as governor, assuring he would replicate same if allowed to fly the APC flag in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former transport minister said: \u201cWhen I was governor of Rivers State, Buratai was a brigade commander while Abba Suleiman was the police commissioner. We ensured we engaged the teeming and idle youths by giving them jobs that kept them from the street. By so doing, we forestalled peace to the creeks in the state\u201d\n\n\u2018Osinbajo won\u2019t back down\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, The Progressive Project (TPP), the umbrella body of all groups canvassing support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to emerge as APC presidential candidate, has denied a viral video indicating that their principal was planning to step down for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nIn the viral video released Sunday by one Daniel Bwala, an aide to the Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, claimed that the VP was planning to concede to Asiwaju.\n\nBut reacting to the development through a statement made available to Blueprint and signed by the Director of Operations of TPP, Alhaji Usman Aliyu Usman, the body described the claim as false and \u201ca gutter fight which Osinbajo supporters cannot join.\u201d\n\nThe statement warned \u201cpaid agents\u201d to stop the spread of falsehoods against Vice President Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cOne of our visible supporters, Professor Olusola Adeyeye, a two-term Senator who represented Osun Central Senatorial District between 2011 to 2019 made some weighty statements about the APC presidential primaries on Saturday and by Sunday, really baseless and mischievous anti-Osinbajo statements began circulating.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, one of these came from Mr. Daniel Bwala, an aide to Deputy Senate President, Senator Omo-Agege who currently appears to moonlight as spokesman for the Bola Tinubu campaign.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, without any proof, Mr. Bwala started circulating a video clip with claims that Professor Yemi Osinbajo is \u2018allegedly planning to step down for Asiwaju\u2019; Mr. Bwala had no evidence and he ought to know better than going to town with such.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is still riding high in the race and our decision not to interfere in some camps\u2019 deliberate spread of illusion and untruths is only motivated by our genuine confidence in our candidate\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cAs stated long ago, no group linked to TPP will join any individual or group in playing gutter politics or smearing others but we need to unequivocally state that Professor Yemi Osinbajo is not contemplating any measure of capitulation to any candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile we are sworn to total allegiance to the Constitution, patriotic values and the spirit of good sportsmanship, we denounce the misleading information and unbecoming tricks that some supporters in other presidential candidates\u2019 camps embrace so eagerly.\n\n\u201cWe denounce too, the baseless ad unhelpful information being randomly disseminated by the likes of Mr. Bwala.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of the nation and its democracy, TPP appeals to all aspirants and supporters at all levels to learn from the focused and principled campaign methods of Professor Osinbajo and his supporters whose collective determination towards actualising Nigeria\u2019s enduring greatness is a cause that genuinely deserves the support of all patriots.\n\n\u201cWe categorically debunk the spate of falsehoods against PYO\u2019s candidature and we urge all Nigerian patriots to look forward to join us in the forthcoming celebrations on the day after APC presidential primaries,\u2019 the TPP official stated.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "title": "I can vouch for Oyebanji's pedigree, competence- Sen Bamidele -",
          "text": "The Senator Representing Ekiti Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele has said loyalty to All Progressives Congress (APC) and his confidence in the ability and capacity of Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (BAO) to provide responsible governance were the reasons he didn\u2019t challenge Oyebanji\u2019s victory in the January 27 primary election.\n\nSpeaking in Ado Ekiti on Friday as a Guest of Honour at an event organised by BAO\u2019s Anchor Organization to drum support for the APC gubernatorial candidate.\n\nIn his address at the event, MOB as he\u2019s fondly called said even though he contested in the primary, he had to embrace reconciliation as a loyal party member and work in the interest of the party the moment the winner had emerged.\n\nGoing down memory lane, Senator Bamidele reminded the crowd of favours the party had done him in the past, especially his emergence as Senatorial candidate in 2019 and the consensus agreement that has favoured him again to fly the party\u2019s flag for the Ekiti Central Senatorial seat in 2023.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited today because our party is waxing stronger everyday. I\u2019m here not only as Senatorial candidate but as a loyal party man who also believe in the competence and capacity of Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji to provide good governance in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cOf course after the primary in January, many people thought we would challenge it in court but I knew that was not the way to go. I told my supporters that it\u2019s a family affair that must be treated within the family. I thank my brother, Governor John Kayode Fayemi, I thank the first lady and other leaders for the roles they played in making sure the family ties remain intact,\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the preparation of the party to win the June 18 election, Bamidele commended the various groups for their selfless sacrifice which made the event possible.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday is memorable in the history of our great party and the state because what is happening is a demonstration of the fact that politics has indeed gone back to the people. I\u2019m particularly excited because people have realized the need for participatory politics. I want to implore our people to move out and preach the gospel according to BAO for us to be victorious on June 18.\n\nEkiti State First Lady, Erelu Bisi Fayemi who spoke on the need for continuity at the event saluted all the support groups as well as the Women Campaign Council for their efforts towards BAO\u2019s victory in the coming governorship election.\n\nShe pointed out that continuity would lead to the retention of various laudable achievements of the outgoing administration.\n\n\u201cYou will all agree with me that Ekiti is not developing at the pace other developed states are developing. The reason is simple; there is no consistency in administrations as we see in Lagos and many other other states,\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Chairman of BAO Anchor Organization, Hon. Gbenga Agbeyo said the Anchor groups were committed to ensuring that total victory was record for the APC governorship candidate come June 18.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, a former APC State Chairman, Chief Jide Awe also admitted that there hasn\u2019t been anytime members of the public showed commitment to who governs them in Ekiti as being witnessed now.\n\nAwe called on APC leaders and members not to relent in their efforts at recording a landslide victory in the coming election.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate, Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji in his response thanked members of the BAO Anchor Organization for their support and promised to fulfil all his promises to Ekiti people if emerged as governor come June 18.\n\n\u201cI stand before you today that I will not disappoint you. That I will fulfil all my promises,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe governorship candidate, who restated his commitment to issue- based campaign, called on party members to refrain from any act of violence during the electioneering period. He said the record of performance of the APC- led administration in the state and the massive support of the people were enough to earn the party victory at the June 18 election.",

Some leading political parties and politicians also spend between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes.https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#\n\nIn the letter dated 21 May, 2022 and signed by SERAP https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cNigerians have the right to know about the accounts and financial transactions of their political parties, especially the major parties with a strong possibility to assume government in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201ctransparency and accountability of political parties is important to achieve greater transparency in public life, curb the influence of money in politics, promote a level playing field, and remove the risks to the independence of political actors and would-be public office holders.\u201d\n\nSERAP also said, \u201cIt is both immoral and illegal to pay citizens to vote for a particular political party or candidate. Unpunished cases of vote buying and related electoral offences would continue to undermine good governance, the rule of law, moral values, as well as hinder citizens\u2019 participation in elections.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cWhen a political candidate decides to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidate will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote buying and related electoral offences encourage poor governance and weaken citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their elected officials accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to urgently take measures and to collaborate with appropriate anti-corruption agencies to ensure the effective prosecution of any outstanding cases of vote buying and related electoral offences allegedly committed in the context of the 2019 general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of transparency and accountability in political finance is seriously undermining the legitimacy and credibility of the democratic and electoral processes, and invariably contributing to denying the citizens the right to effective participation in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure of political parties to comply with transparency and accountability frameworks would undermine citizens\u2019 trust in their political parties and lack of trust will inevitably destroy confidence in the system and decrease citizens\u2019 interest and participation in the democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cElections are only one part of the democratic process, and a fair and effective electoral system must be founded in an adequate democratic infrastructure and responsibility of political leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, several political parties have for many years failed to submit their annual financial statements to INEC. Many political parties have failed to submit election expenses reports, and to disclose material contributions received from individuals and corporate bodies to the Commission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also been apparently unable or unwilling to monitor, examine and publish these financial statements.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, some leading political parties, politicians and other political actors reportedly paid between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes. For many years, allegations of vote buying (the payment of cash or gifts in exchange for voting) and related electoral offences have characterised elections and party primaries in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that despite several provisions of the Electoral Act (as amended), anti-corruption laws, and the country\u2019s international anti-corruption obligations, suspected perpetrators of vote buying and related electoral offences frequently escape justice for their crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, INEC has consistently failed to exercise its powers and to provide the leadership that would promote collaboration with appropriate anti-corruption agencies to facilitate and ensure thorough, transparent and effective investigation of cases, and the arrest and prosecution of suspected perpetrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 86(1) of the Electoral Act 2022 requires every political party to submit to INEC a detailed annual statement of assets and liabilities and analysis of its sources of funds and other assets and statement of its expenditure. Failure to comply is an offence under Section 86(2), which is punishable by imprisonment for a term of six months or a fine of N1,000,000 or both.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Section 86(3)(4) INEC has the power to examine the records and audited accounts kept by any political party, and to publish the report on such examinations and audit in two national newspapers and Commission\u2019s website within 30 days of receipt of the results.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 226 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022 also requires INEC to prepare and submit a report every year to the National Assembly on the accounts and balance sheet of every political party. Under Section 225(5), INEC has the power to give directions to political parties regarding their books or records of financial transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution and international standards guarantee and protect the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as well as in general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right to vote freely for the political party and candidate of one\u2019s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe effective exercise of the right of qualified Nigerians to have a voice in the election of those who make and enforce the laws under which, as good citizens, they live can contribute to the enjoyment of other human rights, including to corruption-free public services, freedom of expression and digital and data rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic confidence in voting systems serves as an indispensable feature of a full and healthy democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPersistent failure to arrest and prosecute suspected perpetrators of vote buying and related electoral offences may ultimately undermine public confidence, the integrity of the country\u2019s elections, and lead to wide-spread disaffection with the electoral process.\u201d",

          "text": "Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have intercepted 24 parcels of cocaine concealed in 12 tyres of lawn mowers imported into the country through the Port Harcourt International Airport by a Brazilian returnee, Okechukwu Amaechi.\n\nForty-five years old Amaechi, has just finished serving his jail term for drug trafficking in the South American country.\n\nHe was arrested at the Port Harcourt airport on Saturday 7th May upon his arrival from Brazil via Doha onboard Qatar Airline flight QR1433.\n\nThe spokesman of the NDLEA, Femi Babafemi in a statement said preliminary investigations revealed Amaechi, who was arrested and convicted in Brazil for drug offences completed serving his jail sentence in March 2022, after which he decided to return to Nigeria with three new lawn mowers where he concealed 24 parcels of cocaine weighing 4.56 kilogrammes.\n\nBabafemi said each parcel concealed in the tyres of the three lawn mowers bears some unique inscriptions, which are believed to be means of identification of the owners of the drug., adding that the two parcels in one of the tyres of the first lawn mower bear \u201cO LORD\u201d and \u201cHAVE MERCY\u201d.\n\nThe parcels in one of the tyres of the second mower bears the inscription \u201cIN GOD\u201d and \u201cWE TRUST\u201d, while the third mower has \u201cIJIOMA\u201d and \u201c186.6\u201d inscribed on the two parcels hidden in one of its tyres.\n\nAccording to him, Amaechi claimed one of his church members gave him the lawn mowers to deliver to his brother in Port Harcourt.\n\nIn other operations across Zamfara, Kogi, Rivers, Kaduna and Kano States, no fewer than 37, 876 tablets of pharmaceutical opioids especially Tramadol; 10,884 bottles of codeine and 825.016 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa were recovered during raids in the past week.\n\nIn Zamfara state, a Mercedes Benz truck with reg. no. XB 986 AGB from Onitsha to Sokoto was intercepted in Tsafe area last Friday and apart from the driver and his assistant that were arrested, three other persons: Alex Chukwuemeka, 37; Ignatius Odikpo, 47 and Andrew Chijokwe, 47 who are owners of the drug exhibits were arrested in a follow up operation at a hotel in Gusau while waiting to receive the consignment for possible movement to Sokoto.\n\nHe added that seized from them include: 9,900 bottles of codeine, 599.3 kilogrammes cannabis and 15,889 tablets of other opioids.\n\nIn Kogi state, a fake security agent, Richard Agada was arrested last Wednesday while conveying 10 bags of cannabis sativa weighing 116.8 kilogrammes in a white Nissan van.\n\nBabafemi also revealed that various quantities of opioids and cannabis were equally seized in two separate operations the previous Tuesday and Monday in other parts of the state with the arrest of a drug dealer, Ayuba Nda Isah, 32.\n\nHe added that three suspects: Nornu Abanne; Yirakpoa Emmanuel and Dornu Gbarazia were arrested at Kaani community and Bori with 90 kilogrammes cannabis and 1.5 grammes of cocaine last Wednesday.\n\nIn Kaduna, three suspects: Nura Salis, Bawa Musa and Charity Jacob were arrested last Tuesday at Warri Street within the state capital with 4,900 tablets of tramadol, 890 ampoules of diazepam injection, 257 ampoules of pentazocine injection, 1,950 tablets of nitrazepam and 830 tablets of carbazapine.\n\nIn Kano state, an alleged drug dealer, Abubakar Abdullahi, 47, with 5,970 capsules and tablets of tramadol was arrested, while Nasiru Musa and Musa Mohammed were also nabbed with 5,000 caps of the same drug last Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, while commending the officers and men of PHIA, Zamfara, Kogi, Rivers, Kaduna and Kano commands of the agency for the arrests and seizures, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd) said the war against drug abuse and trafficking is one that must be won. He therefore charged all commands of the agency to remain on the offensive against the cartels as they take advocacy messages to communities and schools.",

          "text": "Ukraine ruled out a ceasefire or any territorial concessions to Moscow as Russia stepped up its attack in the country\u2019s east and south, pounding the Donbas and Mykolaiv regions with air strikes and artillery fire.\n\nKyiv\u2019s stance has become increasingly uncompromising in recent weeks as Russia experienced military setbacks while Ukrainian officials grew worried they might be pressured to sacrifice land for a peace deal.\n\n\u201cThe war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said in a Twitter post on Sunday.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda offered Warsaw\u2019s backing, telling lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday that the international community had to demand Russia\u2019s complete withdrawal and that sacrificing any of it would be a \u201chuge blow\u201d to the entire West.\n\n\u201cWorrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to (President Vladimir) Putin\u2019s demands,\u201d Duda said, the first foreign leader to address Ukrainian parliament in person since Russia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion.\n\n\u201cOnly Ukraine has the right to decide about its future,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the same parliamentary session, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy renewed a plea for stronger economic sanctions against Moscow.\n\n\u201cHalf-measures should not be used when aggression should be stopped,\u201d he said.\n\nShortly after both finished speaking, an air raid siren was heard in the capital, a reminder that the war raged on even if its front lines are now hundreds kilometres away.\n\nRussia is waging a major offensive in Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas, after ending weeks of resistance by the last Ukrainian fighters in the strategic southeastern port of Mariupol.\n\nThe heaviest fighting focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko told Ukrainian television on Sunday.\n\nThe cities form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv and shifting its focus to the east and south of the country.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said on Sunday its forces pummeled Ukrainian command centres, troops and ammunition depots in Donbas and the Mykolaiv region in the south with air strikes and artillery.\n\nReuters was unable to independently verify those battlefield reports.\n\nRussian-backed separatists already controlled parts of Luhansk and neighbouring Donetsk before the invasion, but Moscow wants to seize the remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the region.\n\nAn explosion severely injured a Russian-appointed mayor in the town of Enerhodar, Russia\u2019s RIA news agency reported. Reuters could not immediately establish what caused the explosion.\n\nNO CONCESSIONS, NO CEASEFIRE\n\nUkraine\u2019s lead negotiator, Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, ruled out any territorial concessions and rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire, saying it meant Russian troops would stay in occupied territories, which Kyiv could not accept.\n\n\u201cThe (Russian) forces must leave the country and after that the resumption of the peace process will be possible,\u201d Podolyak said in an interview with Reuters on Saturday, referring to calls for an immediate ceasefire as \u201cvery strange.\u201d\n\nConcessions would backfire because Russia would use the break in fighting to come back stronger, he said. read more\n\nRecent calls for an immediate ceasefire have come from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\n\nThe end of fighting in Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured, gave Putin a rare victory after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of combat.\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up Mariupol\u2019s vast Azovstal steelworks have surrendered, the Russian defence ministry said on Friday. While Ukraine has not confirmed a full withdrawal, the commander of one of the units in the factory, said in a video that Ukraine\u2019s military command had ordered the troops there to stand down in order to preserve their lives.\n\nFull control of Mariupol gives Russia command of a land route linking the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014, with mainland Russia and parts of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists.\n\nRUSSIA CUTS GAS TO FINLAND\n\nRussian state gas company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Saturday it had halted gas exports to Finland, which has refused Moscow\u2019s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after Western countries imposed sanctions over the invasion.\n\nMost European gas supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars and last month Moscow cut off Bulgaria and Poland after they rejected the new terms.\n\nAlong with sanctions, Western nations have stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine. On Saturday, Kyiv got another huge boost when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic and humanitarian aid.\n\nMoscow says Western sanctions and the arms deliveries for Kyiv, amount to a \u201cproxy war\u201d by Washington and its allies.\n\nPutin calls the invasion a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and rid it of radical anti-Russian nationalists. Ukraine and its allies have dismissed that as a baseless pretext for the war, which has killed thousands of people in Ukraine, displaced millions and shattered cities.",
