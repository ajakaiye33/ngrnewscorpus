          "title": "Yam thief shoots farm owner to death in Osun, suspect arrested",
          "text": "A man simply identified as Sunday has been arrested by the Osun State Police Command for allegedly killing a Tiv farmer resident in Eripa town.\n\nDonald, a colleague of the deceased farmer, identified as Sunday, while speaking with The PUNCH, said the incident occurred late on Friday at Odo Ada, a village in Eripa.\n\nAccording him, the suspect had thought that the owner of the farm had gone home, and was already digging out yam from a heap, when the deceased suddenly appeared and challenged him.\n\nHe said, \u201cSunday was caught by the owner of the farm, who also bears Sunday as he was digging out yam from a heap on his farm located at Odo Ada village. The suspect had thought the owner of the farmer had gone home as of the time he entered the farm Friday evening.\n\n\u201cSunday had actually left the farm that day, but not long after he left, he had to return because he forgot something on the farm. But before he arrived there, the suspect had entered into the farm, and was already digging out yam from a heap, when Sunday arrived.\n\n\u201cHe challenged him and that led to an altercation. The suspect, who had a gun with him, shot the farmer and killed him on the spot.\n\n\u201cA younger brother of the farmer, who was with him when the incident happened, immediately ran to where other colleagues of Sunday were, and informed them. They all ran towards the farm and arrested the suspect. He is currently with the police. The remains of the deceased had been deposited in a morgue.\u201d\n\nBut when contacted, the spokesperson of the state police command, Yemisi Opalola, said the account given by an eyewitness, who was with the deceased when the incident, happened was slightly different.\n\nOpalola said the deceased was on the farm with his younger brother when Sunday arrived there, and altercation ensued among them.\n\nShe further said, \u201cThe owner of the farm named Sunday, a Tiv was killed by an indigene of Iree also named Sunday. From what an eyewitness told us, Sunday from Iree, had been reported to Eleripa of Eripa, severally by farmers in the area that he was entering their farms to steal produce.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the day the incident happened, we were told the deceased and his younger brother were on the farm when Sunday arrived. The deceased\u2019s younger brother, on sighting the suspect, accused him of always coming around to steal their produce.\n\n\u201cThat statement reportedly infuriated the suspect and he shot the owner of the farmer, while his brother fled the scene and ran to where other colleagues of the farmer were and informed them of the incident. We also learnt that the suspect attempted to kill the younger brother of the deceased, but he escaped.\n\n\u201cWe were also told that it was the suspect that carried the corpse of the deceased on his motorcycle and was already coming towards the town when other colleagues of the Tiv farmer met him and retrieved the body.\u201d\n\nShe added that the suspect is in police custody and dismissed insinuations that operatives had requested for money before investigation, assuring that justice would be served in the matter.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Rosemary Iwunze\n\nAs the price of crude oil in the international market continues to rise, hitting over $88 per barrel last week against $62 of the budget benchmark, the Federal Government has been asked to consider using the surplus to either reduce the budget deficit or use it to build infrastructure.\n\nChief Consultant at B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, who took this position last week, noted that government should also be responsible to its insurance needs.\n\nREAD ALSOAPC: Court strikes out suit challenging Buni led Committee\n\nSpeaking at a media parley with insurance journalists in Lagos, sponsored by Boof Insurance Brokers Limited and B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Adedipe said: \u201cThe price of crude has been favourable to us. It is either you use the gain to reduce the deficit, or alternatively, you use that gain to build infrastructure, which ultimately will also increase government revenue.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that the forthcoming election could create liquidity pressures in the economy as there will be too much money in circulation.\n\n\u201cIn pre election years, politicians spend a lot of money and that creates liquidity pressure. You have so much money circulating and that stands to put pressure on prices, so it will be expected this year that there\u2019s will be inflationary pressure.\u201d\n\nAdedipe also decried the high volume of imports against exports in the country. Speaking on the insurance sector, Adedipe said: \u201cFor the insurance sector to grow, government need also to be\n\nresponsible to its insurance obligations which talks about paying premium. There also must be need for flexibility and also ensuring that compulsory insurance is enforced because enforcement had always been an issue.\n\n\u201cIf the government is responsible and put a lot of fervour into enforcement, then what we have today as compulsory insurance we can actually create more value from. And when insurance sector is vibrant, it will galvanize businesses and individuals to take risk and that is how economies grow.\n\n\u201cThe freedom to take risk is on the back of a vibrant insurance sector, so the conversation should be how do we make that sector vibrant and that brings us to involve more interactions between government agencies and the insurance sector, so that all the stakeholders constantly are engaging and so whatever is needed to be done to make us deepen insurance, the government will keep making that happen.\u201d",

          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nThe move by the House of Representatives to investigate the involvement of the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) and the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali in the execution of the court judgment at Magodo Estate in Lagos State has been described as a \u201cwith-hunting,\u201d mission.\n\nHouse of Representatives had mandated its committee on Justice, public petition and police to investigate the involvement of the duo.\n\nCounsel to Shangisha Landlords Association, Deji Fasusi, while reacting to House of Representatives probe and media reports in a statement, yesterday, said it was another card in their bag of tricks to frustrate the due execution of the Judgment of the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile condemning some media reports over the issues, the lawyer stated: \u201cWe have consistently lamented the deliberate and willful attempt by some respected members of the fourth estate to re-narrate the facts surrounding the events of the 21st day of December 2021. For the discerning minds, this latest lame attempt at probe is another card in their bag of tricks to frustrate the due execution of the Judgment of the Supreme Court. Because the principal actors in this macabre dance and orchestrators of this self-imploding attempt by the House of Representatives at probe could not do anything possible to halt and/or stop the execution, they have now resorted to this tactics.\u201d\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe Judgment-creditors (Shangisha Landlords Association) are certainly not surprised that the motion seeking to probe AG and IGP were moved by two members of the House of Representatives representing Kosofe; Ademorin Kuye and Rotimi Agunsoye.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that the duo under the guise of \u201cmotion of urgent importance\u201d moved the House of Representatives to investigate the invasion of Magodo GRA Phase 2 by Nigerian Police under the direction of Inspector-General of Police and the Attorney-General of the Federation. Nothing could be more ridiculous and laughable.\n\n\u201cThey never bothered to move the house to investigate why the Lagos State Government and/or its officials never complied with the decision of the Supreme Court since 2012 or why they never adhered nor complied with the order of interlocutory injunction restraining them from allocating or dealing in the land the subject matter of the suit while it was before the court, all the way from the High court to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThey are merely grandstanding and we would not be surprised that this latest diatribe and attempted probe is sponsored by the very people who have made the execution of the Judgment impossible until now that their intentions aimed at frustrating the enjoyment of the fruits of the judgment has been exposed to the general public.\n\nTheir connivance, backhand dealings and double-speak is legendary. No wonder they have subjected the Judgment of the Supreme Court to their own interpretation and they believe in their warped mind that according to them, \u201cthe declaratory judgment of the Supreme Court only recognized the judgment creditors as being entitled to the allocation and re-allocation of 549 plots of land in Shangisha Village.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to refresh the memory of these law-makers to the effect that the Attorney-General of the Federation is the Chief Law Officer of the country, and rather than vilify, castigate and unduly criticize him, he ought to be commended for ensuring that the Rule of Law is maintained and the decision of the Supreme Court is enforced in any part of the country.\n\n\u201cThus, this attempt at a needless probe is nothing but a witch-hunt and it is a legislative over-reach in all the circumstances. These lawmakers ought to hide their faces in shame as it is clear that their action is at cross-purposes with the conciliatory, mature and settlement approach which the Lagos State Government has initiated with the judgment-creditors to finally fulfill and end this impasse once and for all.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026.okays S\u2019Court\u2019s validation of c\u2019ttee\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nA Federal High Court, sitting in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, has struck out a suit challenging the competence of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nThe Federal High Court ruling has therefore put to rest issues surrounding the legality of the Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\nDelivering judgement on the suit, Justice Pheobe Msuen Ayua struck out the name of the National Chairman of APC, the National Working Committee, and the National Secretary, Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, sued as 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants, respectively, for being non-juristic persons.\n\nA Delta State High Court, had on October 15, 2021, struck out an action filed by Elvis Ayomanor and others, challenging the APC Ward, LGA and State Congresses.\n\nThe Delta State High Court, presided over by Justice G.B Briki-Okolosi, had also, on the December 22, 2021, struck out Suit No: A/139/ 2021, between Chukwusa Edafe Matthew and 14 others Vs. APC and others, to set aside the APC Ward, LGA and State Congresses in Delta State.\n\nThe Court held that the action was non-justiciable and incurably incompetent, noting that the substratum of the matter bordered on the internal affairs of the ruling APC.\n\nThe ruling corroborates a Supreme Court judgment, which held \u201cthat the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party is empowered to create, elect and appoint Committees (including the instant CECPC) or any other committee it may deem necessary to act in any capacity.\u201d\n\nRecall that the ruling party has been enmeshed in crisis, with leaders divided into power blocs, as the struggle for the control of the party structure hots up, ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nHowever, a chieftain of the party and Commissioner for Information and Communications in Kogi State, Kingsley Fanwo, has dismissed the notion of a crisis in the party.\n\nFanwo, who made the clarifications while speaking to the media on Friday, said what was happening in the party should be expected.\n\n\u201cThe party is not in any form of crisis. What we have is an attrition of interests, which is normal in a ruling party that many believe will continue to lead Nigeria beyond 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Mai Mala Buni leadership of the party has done very well in stabilising the party and attracting political heavyweights into the party. PDP is saying there is a problem in APC, and their Governors, Senators and other heavyweights are dumping their party for the ruling APC. Who is in crisis here?\n\n\u201cCrisis ridden parties are not naturally attractive. So Nigerians know which party is struggling and lamenting. If they think Nigerians have forgotten how they destroyed this country, they will know better in 2023,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "Former Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar has broken his silence on how winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election late Moshood Kashimawo Abiola died while in detention.\n\nAbiola died on July 7, 1998 when Abubakar was in power.\n\nThe former Head of State denied insinuations the late business mogul was poisoned.\n\nRather, he said he died after falling ill while receiving a delegation from the United States of America.\n\nHe spoke in an interview with Trust TV.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWell, I smile because there were lots of allegations here and there that we killed Abiola. As always when I am talking about late Abiola, I still thank God for directing me on things to do when he gave me the leadership of this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the day Moshood Abiola passed away, may he rest in peace, two to three things make me always say I thank my God for the guidance He gave me.\n\n\u201cOne was I received a delegation from America headed by Pickering who was then, I think, the secretary of state or so. In his team I remember very well, was Susan Rice. I remember her very well because of the role she played later.\n\n\u201cSo after the normal courtesy and discussion we had, when they were leaving my office, Pickering said \u201cYour Excellency we made a request to see Moshood Abiola but we were denied\u201d, so I said \u201cWhy were you denied? who denied you?\u201d There and then I made a decision, I said \u201cLook, you will see Moshood definitely, I overruled whoever said you cannot see him\u201d. So I now called my chief security officer, I said \u201cPlease make arrangement for this team to see Abiola,\u201d that is one point.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow during the incarceration of Moshood Abiola, except his personal doctor, to my knowledge, no member of his family saw him. So when I became head of state, based on consultation and interaction together with Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, I gave the family a date that they could come and see him.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Abdulsalami cautions politicians over fiery comments\n\nRecalling the incidents on the day MKO died, Abubakar said: \u201cSo a day before he died, his family came to Abuja to see him. For one reason or the other, the whole family could not see him at the same time, so it was agreed that when this group of his family will see him today, tomorrow the next team will see him.\n\n\u201cSo they saw him like yesterday, now this team from US came to see me and I said they could see him. Normally it was in the evenings the family go and see him. So because I had authorized the American team to see him, so the other part of the family were waiting to see him.\n\n\u201cSo, it was at this meeting when the American team was meeting Abiola he fell sick and suddenly the security officers called the medical team to come and attend to him, and when they saw the situation they said it was severe and they needed to take him to the medical centre. So it was the medical team plus the American team that took him to the medical centre, unfortunately at the medical centre he gave up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen my security chief called and said \u201cI have bad news for you\u201d, I asked what it was, he said \u201cAbiola is dead\u201d. I was shocked. He told me he was there with the American team, at that time I was staying in the barracks, I had not moved to the villa, so I said okay, let him take the American team to my house, I will meet them at the house; so I closed from the office, and went there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue now was how do I break the news to Abiola\u2019s family and how do we tell the world Abiola had passed on. I must be thankful to God and again to Ambassador Kingibe because we called on him and asked him to bring the family of Abiola. So when they came I broke the news, that unfortunately this is what has happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you would expect, the family broke down and they started crying, I can\u2019t remember which of the ladies, I held her, she was crying, sobbing, it was then Susan Rice, that is why I always remember her, said \u201cMr President that is not your job, let me do it\u201d, so she now held this lady until she settled down and she calmed down a little bit.\n\n\u201cThen we had to summon my second in command and other people and then strategized on how to break the news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why I always say I thank my God for guiding me, if I hadn\u2019t said the American team should go and meet Abiola certainly I don\u2019t know how I would explain to the world that Abiola had died, and the American team will they believe me that we had not killed Abiola at that time when they were requesting to see him?\u201d.",

          "text": "*Buhari\u2019s administration clueless, piling eternal debts, says Ayu\n\nJames Sowole\n\n\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday restated his vow not to return to partisan politics.\n\nObasanjo, 84, made this known when a delegation of the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, visited him at his residence in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nThis is coming as Ayu has described the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration as a clueless government that is piling eternal debts for future generations.\n\nThe PDP delegation during the meeting, held behind closed doors, dwelt extensively on the party\u2019s search for a suitable presidential candidate, who will wrestle power from the APC.\n\nThe National Secretary of the party, Senator Sam Anyanwu; the Deputy National Chairman, South and former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Mr Taofeek Arapaja; other members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) and the PDP vice presidential candidate in 2019 elections, Mr, Peter Obi, were part of the delegation.\n\nThe delegation also include a former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; a former governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido; and two former governors of Cross River State, Mr. Donald Duke, Senator Liyel Imoke; former Police Affairs Minister, Adamu Waziri, and former Minister of Special Duties, Tanimu Kabiru Turaki (SAN), were also among the PDP chieftains in attendance.\n\nA source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that the PDP leaders sought Obasanjo\u2019s contribution to the issue of zoning and the search for a formidable presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe visit was part of the wider consultations embarked upon by the PDP to strategise for the 2023 general election, especially the presidential election. They had fruitful discussions on the issue of zoning and the need to search for a suitable and credible presidential candidate,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, after the closed-door meeting, Obasanjo publicly told his guests to bear in mind that he was no longer in partisan politics.\n\nRecall that the former president had some years ago publicly announced that he was quitting politics, and tearing his PDP membership card in his house in Abeokuta.\n\nBut speaking yesterday, Obasanjo said: \u201cI have been with the party right from inception. Whatever I do in my own life, because I became president on the platform of PDP, PDP will continue to be part of the history of my life.\n\n\u201cBut having said that, the day that in my ward I decided to tear my PDP card was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP and that day I vowed that I will not be a member of any political party again, but I will remain a statesman in Nigeria, in West Africa, in Africa and indeed in the world.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who said the responsibilities on the shoulder of Ayu, were enormous, prayed that he would be able to carry them.\n\n\u201cYour case is like the case of Idi Amin of Uganda. Idi Amin came to me and he said \u2018my brother, you have Africa load and it is on your shoulder, I pray God will help you carry Africa load\u2019.\n\n\u201cIyorchia, you have PDP load with Nigeria load and it is only God that can help you to carry this load, which of course, I believe if God gives you a responsibility, He will also give you the wherewithal to be able to carry that responsibility.\n\n\u201cIn my hope, which is also some people\u2019s disappointment is that some of you who knew how things were done 21 years ago are still there but then some people will say here if you knew how it was done 21 years ago why have you not consistently be doing it? I think you can answer that, I will not answer for you, but if you ask me, I retired 14 years ago and I remain retired and I will remain retired by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cBut if I retired from partisan politics if politics is the welfare of the people, I must not retire from the welfare and well-being of people whether in my community, in my state, in my own country, anywhere in Africa or indeed anywhere in the world and that is why I have the type of responsibility that I now have in the horn of Africa, which is not an easy responsibility, but it has to be done. But I will say that your responsibility is not an easy one either, but it has to be done.\n\n\u201cBut bear in mind and I want to emphasise that I\u2019m no longer in partisan politics and there is nothing that will bring me back to partisan politics, but I will always be interested in what is good for Nigeria and anybody who wants to have my advice, I will give it in the best interest of Nigeria and the best interest of Africa,\u201d Obasanjo explained.\n\nResponding, Ayu commended Obasanjo for what he did when he was Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\nHe described the President Muhammadu Buhari administration as clueless and piling eternal debts for this and future generations.\n\nAyu also described the present administration as wicked, pointing out that only a wicked regime would subject generations unborn to the servitude of slavery.\n\nNot done, the National Chairman blamed Buhari for the low in Nigeria\u2019s international reputation as an insecure country and the poverty capital of the world, a reversal of fortunes which he measured, were the direct opposite of the achievements of Obasanjo of the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe thank you for the service you rendered and the great work you have done in the PDP as the first president.\n\n\u201cYour period as president under the platform of PDP was seen as the golden era of the PDP because not only did you grow the economy to be the biggest economy in Africa, you were able to eradicate Nigeria from slavery by negotiating and cancelling so much of our foreign debts that would have made it very difficult to run the country.\n\n\u201cBy the time you left office, Nigeria was set free, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was on the increase daily; we were respected in the international community, everywhere we went.\n\n\u201cI remember I accompanied you as your minister to some countries \u2013 Germany, Indian \u2013 I saw the respect they accorded you in India and I was very proud to be a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cToday, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the same recognition because what we have has fallen short of the leadership that Nigeria deserves.\n\n\u201cApart from the infrastructural intervention, which you did, most of the institutions, some of them are today useful\u2026 like EFCC, the ICPC and so on you- put it in place.\n\n\u201cI remember when you took some of us to Germany to the offices or the Transparency International and we had a very useful discussion there. So, you are very passionate about this country and you did a lot and we thought we should come and thank you for what you have done not to just Nigerians but our party and Africa.\n\n\u201cOver these years that you were in power, you saw every Nigerian as one family, you didn\u2019t discriminate against the South, the East, the West or the North. Even though in your first tenure, the South-west didn\u2019t actually support you, but you brought them back on board and they supported you in your second tenure,\u201d Ayu explained.\n\n\u201cIn Africa today, I think today, in all modesty, after the departure of President Mandela, there is only one person of such stature on the African continent and we are proud that that person is a Nigerian and that Nigerian is no other than President Olusegun Obasanjo and you have continued to display the leadership because it is wrong to address you as Nigerian leader or Yoruba leader or an Owu chief.\n\n\u201cEven though you retired from partisan politics, partisan politics will never retire from your blood, because you want the right thing done and since you want the right thing done, for the life you will remain the emeritus member of the PDP. You cannot build a house and leave it to collapse,\u201d Ayu told Obasanjo.\n\nHe promised the former president that the PDP would restore Nigeria\u2019s lost glory.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "MPC: Analysts Caution against Interest Rate Increase",
          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nAs the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) begins its first meeting for the year 2022, in Abuja tomorrow, economic analysts have advised against hike in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) despite the mounting pressure on the apex bank to announce a higher rate.\n\nMPR was retained at 11.5 per cent at its September 2021 meeting.\n\nMPR is the interest rate at which CBN lends to the commercial banks. The MPR is the benchmark against which other lending rates in the economy are pegged and is usually used as an instrument to moderate inflation in the economy.\n\nIn their forecast of the outcome of the MPC meeting, analysts from Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), Cordros Capital Limited and Cowry Asset Management Company Limited, in separate reports, released last week, believed that the current pressure on the CBN is not enough to cause an upset in the nation\u2019s interest rate regime.\n\nAccording to them, issues putting pressure on the MPC to increase benchmark rate include an upward inflationary pressure amid the anticipation of subsidy removal, increasing electricity tariff, foreign exchange volatility and the intending rate hike by Federal Reserve in 2022.\n\nThe pressure was fueled by the latest headline inflation figure, which broke away from the eight-month declining trend to rise by 0.23 per cent to 15.63 per cent from 15.4 per cent in November 2021.\n\nThis increase in inflation figure, according to the report by Financial Derivatives Company, now increases the probability of a rate hike, even though it is highly unlikely this time. The CBN had maintained the status quo 25 times in the last 28 meetings.\n\nThe report did not rule out further increases in domestic inflation in the coming months.\n\nIt however insisted that the monetary policy committee may not yield to the temptation of tampering with the current rate.\n\n\u201cWe expect domestic inflation to increase further in the coming months due to the imminent removal of petrol subsidy and the planting season effect amongst other factors. This increases the chances of a tighter monetary policy stance although it is highly unlikely at this time,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIn their report, analysts from Cordros Capital said despite the reality of the current inflationary trends, the CBN may prefer to exercise some restraints to allow previous policy actions to permeate the economy instead of falling to the temptation to raise interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe uptick in headline inflation in December (2021) will likely stir up a debate among Committee members about whether it is a blip or a trend that will persist in the coming months.\n\nFor us, the significance of this meeting is primarily predicated on the body language of the Committee regarding the timing of the shift to a hawkish monetary stance. Like the November meeting in the prior year, we expect the Committee to affirm its view on monitoring the policy actions of global central banks before commencing its tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cGiven the negative output gap and sub-optimal PMI readings, our baseline, the expectation is that the MPC will judge the need to allow previous policy actions to permeate the economy.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Committee is likely to assess that tightening at this meeting will be \u201ctoo early\u201d and counterproductive. Thus, we expect the MPC to maintain the status quo on all monetary policy parameters. However, we expect the Committee to strike a hawkish tone in light of the gradual tightening in global financing conditions even as inflation remains above the CBN\u2019s medium-term target of six per cent to nine per cent.\u201d\n\nThe report called for the sustenance of the growth momentum as the impact of the favourable base from the prior year dissipates. \u201cAs a result, we project the economy would grow by 2.44 per cent y/y and 2.10 per cent y/y in Q4-21 and Q1-22, respectively. Accordingly, we expect the committee to reiterate the need for CBN to maintain its current interventions to sustain the recovery of output growth, more so that the PMI readings remain sub-optimal. Therefore, we believe the fragile recovery process would induce the committee to maintain its dovish stance,\u201d the report stated, adding that the committee will feel the committee needs to maintain its monetary policy stance to allow its interventions to continue to support improvement in aggregate food supply and, by extension, drive down prices.\u201d\n\nDismissing the possibility of a raise hike, analysts from Cowry Research note that an increase in MPR would hamper economic growth.\n\n\u201cOur expectation on retention of policy rate centres more on the fact that Nigeria\u2019s inflationary pressure is chiefly cost-push, which would be aggravated if the cost of funding goes higher again \u2013 especially for the manufacturers who would pass on the additional cost to their customers. We believe that the monetary policymaker would see pre-election aggravated demand-pull inflationary pressure as transient. Hence, we anticipate an upward trend in stop rates and yields on debt securities, to retain investment in Naira, denominated assets,\u201d the report from Cowry Asset Management stated.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the committee in September 2021 unanimously voted to maintain the key lending rate at 11.5 per cent, with the asymmetric corridor of +100 and -700 basis points around the MPR. The CBN MPC noted that holding stance would allow current recovery in output and decline inflation continue.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Alleged tenure elongation plot untrue, says ruling party\n\n*Ojudu commends party for adopting direct primary for Ekiti 2022\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThe National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, yesterday debunked speculations that he was scheming to contest for the chairmanship position of the party at the National Convention slated for February 26.\n\nThe ruling party, through the Secretary of the Buni-led committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, has also described the speculations that the Yobe State governor was plotting to remain in office as the national chairman of the APC as untrue.\n\nBuni\u2019s clarification came as the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, has commended the Buni-led CECPC for embracing direct primary for Ekiti State governorship election, saying this would help in dousing the tension and return calmness after the internal poll.\n\nThere were strong speculations that Buni was scheming to contest the chairmanship position of the party, following an alleged plot to throw the position open to all geopolitical zones in the North.\n\nBut Buni\u2019s Director-General, Press and Media Affairs, Mr Mamman Muhammed, said in a statement yesterday that the governor had not discussed with anyone that he would contest any position.\n\nHe stated: \u201cGovernor Buni is not scheming for any position. As you know, he is a serving governor, the Executive Governor of Yobe State and comfortably piloting the affairs of the state.\n\n\u201cHe is just the chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the party. As you said, there are so many rumours.\n\n\u201cBut l want to assure you that Governor Buni has not discussed with anyone that he is contesting any position.\n\n\u201cHe has neither confided in nor asked someone to work for him for the aspiration of any office. That he is scheming or lobbying or aspiring for the party\u2019s office is false, unfounded and baseless.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary of the committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe described the report as untrue.\n\nHe said the media is trying to create content that has been misleading Nigeria and keep saying things that are not true.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cYou wanted a convention; we have set a date for our convention; you are coming with another story. That I simply say that it is not true.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidential Adviser on Political Matters, Ojudu, has saluted the national secretariat of the ruling party for embracing direct primary for Ekiti governorship primary, saying this will help in dousing the tension and return calmness after the internal poll.\n\nHe, however, advised the Buni-led National Caretaker executive of the APC to conduct a free, fair and credible primary that can produce a formidable candidate for the June 18 governorship election in the state.\n\nThe presidential aide said this in Ado Ekiti yesterday during an interaction with journalists on the January 27 APC primary to elect its flagbearer.\n\nHe averred that the only way the APC can be proud of itself as a ruling party and win the June 18 election with ease, is to conduct a credible primary that is devoid of violence, venom and bloodshed.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to party men to be civil and peaceful. The only glory we can record in our party is to be peaceful and for our leaders from Abuja to conduct a primary we can all be proud of. Don\u2019t let us be violent just because of the internal election.\n\n\u201cPrimary of any party should be a day of celebration of democracy and not a day of bloodshed. We should be able to do this election without rancour. I am of that belief that politicians, who want to use money to hire thugs to win the election should rather use such money for the development of our unemployed youth.\n\n\u201cOur party officials should be fair and transparent. They should also be efficient with the process.\n\n\u201cI commend Governor Buni-led executive for allowing direct primary for this election, so that every member of the party, either rich or poor, high or low can participate. This will enable us to produce a candidate that can face the candidates of other parties.\n\n\u201cIf by any means we impose someone or throw up someone who used money to induce the people, or relying on federal might, we will have a candidate that cannot win or that wouldn\u2019t be acceptable to the party people.\n\n\u201cLet me clarify that this government of President Buhari doesn\u2019t believe in using federal might to win elections, you have to go through the people to get votes.\u201d\n\nOjudu warned party members to resist vote buying temptation for APC to have a credible and formidable candidate that will be acceptable to all.\n\n\u201cThe aspirants shouldn\u2019t bring thugs to bash and beat the people. Whoever is causing trouble should be exposed, because Ekiti must be in peace. All of us in APC must be able to come together and work to win in June. This is one election that we can\u2019t afford to lose\u201d.\n\nThe presidential aide told the security agencies to maintain neutrality and owe their allegiance to the constitution of the party, rather than individuals.\n\nOn the aspirant he is backing in APC for the primary, Ojudu said: \u201cFor now, I am not in support of anybody. I want to remain neutral so that I will be able to call all aspirants together and settle their differences after the primary.\n\n\u201cLosing an election is hurting, so we need an arbiter to be able to hold the party together and that is the role I intend to play.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari lost election three times. Nobody thought he would ever be president again, but when the time God assigned to him came, he won and it was glorious for him. There is no point in bringing guns to win elections.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Akume: Chairmanship already assigned to North-central, commends Caretaker Committee\n\n*Sheriff: Rumoured zoning aimed at stopping me from leading APC\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAhead of its National Convention in February 26, there is confusion in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the zoning of its chairmanship, with some of the aspirants insisting that it had be decided, and that the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) should just announce it. Others are saying no decision had been reached and want zoning jettisoned.\n\nOn the flip side, except the unforeseen happens, the Chairman of the CECPC, who is also governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is scheming to be on the chairmanship ballot paper when the party converges on Abuja February 26, to elect new National Working Committee (NWC) members.\n\nThe Buni-led CECPC had consistently resisted pressure to hold the elective National Convention, with a plan to sit tight and conduct the party\u2019s primaries for the 2023 elections, but recent push from President Muhammadu Buhari forced it to bend backwards, resulting in the announced convention date.\n\nAspirants from outside the North-central, where the National Chairman\u2019s position is rumoured to have been zoned, are anxious for a quick official position from CECPC on the issue, to know whether to halt the time and resources being expended on their campaigns or not.\n\nAlso, by yesterday, some chairmanship aspirants from the North-central were insisting that the party\u2019s stakeholders had all agreed that the position of Chairman be zoned to the region and that the CECPC should just do the needful by making a formal announcement.\n\nOne of the chairmanship aspirants from the zone and the Minister of Special Duties, George Akume, yesterday insisted that the party had zoned the chairmanship to North-central and commended the party\u2019s leadership for doing so.\n\nAkume, who spoke in Abuja through Simone Shango, the Chairman, Contact Committee of his Campaign Organisation, said it was normal for the party to \u201cdeny the zoning arrangement at this point, but a formal announcement would be made soon.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former Governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, who is also a chairmanship aspirant, described the claim that the position had been zoned to North-central as fake news, adding that other aspirants are afraid of going into the convention with him.\n\nSheriff insisted that he was the target of the rumoured zoning of the position to the North-central, saying he remained the candidate to beat.\n\nHe is of the view that anyone can be chairman \u201cbut not everybody has the capacity to be the chairman.\u201d\n\nAnother chairmanship aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha said while it still remained \u201ca rumour\u201d that the APC chairmanship had been zoned to North-central, it was still in line with his expectation.\n\nMustapha who spoke through his media aide, Dapo Okunbanjo said he remained the frontrunner for the number one party position.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for this zoning, we\u2019ve heard this but we still consider it a rumour just like what the CECPC said. And if indeed it\u2019s zoned officially to North-central, it will be in line with our expectations. We still see ourselves as frontrunners in the race whether it\u2019s zoned or not, but what we are doing is to take things one step at a time.\u201d\n\nThe source that leaked Buni\u2019s move to THISDAY last night, added that the need to perfect the Yobe State governor\u2019s game-plan influenced the delay in announcing the zoning for the office of National Chairman and other party positions.\n\nThe source said: \u201cBuni wants to remain National Chairman; forcing him to organise a National Convention was just a temporary setback. The plan is to declare the National chairmanship position open to the entire North, so that he can contest. Buni has 14 APC governors with him in this plot. His main ally, Abubakar Malami, the Minister of Justice had already cleared the way for him by openly declaring a few weeks back that he could legally combine the office of governor with that of the party\u2019s chairmanship.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY learnt further that Buni, Malami and the 14 governors working with him in the plot would soon meet President Buhari, to convince him on the need for the Yobe governor to continue as chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cOnce they get Buhari\u2019s support, the deal is done. All the other chairmanship candidates will have to step down. Even if they don\u2019t step down, Buni\u2019s name will be the only chairmanship candidate one on the official list of contenders to be voted for on D-Day. This is the list that will be forced on delegates. This guy wants to conduct the 2023 APC primaries and it will be tough stopping this ambition,\u201d added the source.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A shame his mazy runs were not capitalised upon by the forwards.\n\nZaidu Sanusi (2.5/5): Held back from committing forward but held firm on his defensive duties.

Average display.\n\nKenneth Omeruo (2.5/5): Had little to do as Nigeria played from the front but could not stop the Tunisians\u2019 tricky movement on the counter.\n\nWilfred Ndidi (2.5/5): Combative all over the pitch and almost gave Nigeria the lead with a bicycle kick that went just wide. He was however beaten easily for the shot that led to Tunisia\u2019s winner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Aribo (2.5/5): Plenty of passing from the midfield but a low-blocking Tunisian side did not allow his penetrating passes to find their target.

          "text": "Kassim Afegbua has advised Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, not to contest the presidency in 2023.\n\nHe said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) must zone its 2023 presidential candidacy to the south, and as such, Atiku should \u201cditch his quest\u201d.\n\nAfegbua was the spokesperson of the Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign Organisation during the 2019 elections.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Afegbua said Atiku should not make himself a \u201cperpetual candidate\u201d for the presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtiku has unsuccessfully contested the presidency five times in the last three decades.\n\nAfegbua said it is immoral for \u201csuch an old man to attempt another round of political contestation\u201d.\n\nHe said the presidency belongs to the south, adding that the idea of an Atiku candidacy is akin to \u201cpromoting an expired product\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHaving concluded the convention of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, with a new leadership that looks promising, the party will have to rise above board to produce a presidential candidate from the southern part of the country to complete the narrative,\u201d the statement reads in part.\n\n\u201cWith the abysmal performance of President Muhammadu Buhari on account of age, incompetence and lack of capacity and political will to take deliberate and sustained action to bail out the country from all manner of challenges, it will be immoral for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to continue to express interest in seeking election in the 2023 presidential election having attained the retirement age.\n\n\u201cHe cannot assume the role of a perpetual candidate or professional aspirant year in, year out, of the party as though the party was established for him alone. It defeats all sense of logic for such an old man to attempt another round of political contestation at a time the general feeling and mood in the country supports a younger Nigerian from the southern extraction of the country.\n\n\u201cFor me, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar should quit his quest for presidency and support a southern Nigerian candidate in the spirit of fairness, equity and justice, that will assuage the feelings of stakeholders from the southern part of Nigeria. It will be against the run of play and natural justice for any aspirant of Northern extraction to show interest in the 2023 presidential election within the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party threshold. It will offend national sentiments, emotions and logic for anyone from the North to show such interest given our diversities and hetereogenous political configurations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter the 2019 presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar abandoned all of us in Nigeria and sought refuge in far away Dubai, thus exposing us to the intimidations, harassment and threats posed by the desperate APC\u2019s power oligarchs. It was a case of a general abandoning his troops in the battlefield. Rather than draw strength from his presence, his absence exposed us to all manner of challenges.\u201d\n\nAfegbua said the promoters of Atiku\u2019s aspiration \u201cknow in their heart of hearts that it is a project that is dead on arrival\u201d.",

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nAfter working for BCG for over 4 years, that 10 years time frame given by his senior colleagues jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about four years, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. While still running his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\nChari\u2019s warehouse\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy us out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for us,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection.

Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Iyorchia Ayu, National Chairman, People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) has lauded the PDP-led Presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo as being the best government and governance Nigeria has ever had in recent times going by Obasanjo\u2019s effort to shoot up Nigerian economy as the biggest in Africa.\n\nAyu added that Obasanjo as the first and best President produced by PDP was able to set Nigeria and Nigerians from the slavery of the then accumulated foreign debts by negotiating Nigeria\u2019s debts with the Paris Club and other multilateral agencies of the World\n\nRecalled that the then Nigeria President Obasanjo was negotiated and secured a final agreement for debt relief worth $18 billion and an overall reduction of Nigeria\u2019s debt stock by $30 billion, which was completed on April 21, 2006, when Nigeria made its final payment and its books were cleared of any Paris Club debt.\n\nA government policy which considered by Ayu as a landmark achievement of PDP-led government that improved the economy and shot up Nigeria as the biggest economy in Nigeria, but said otherwise that President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress government had brought more hardship on Nigeria and Nigerians by piling up debts.\n\nThe PDP National Chairman said after a private meeting with former President at his Abeokuta President Library on Saturday in the company of other members of PDP\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC), appealed to Nigerians to give PDP a second chance to restructure the battered economy, insecurity and large scale corruption ongoing in the APC-led government in the country.\n\nAyu, who was accompanied by Peter Obi, PDP Vice Presidential Candidate in the 2019 Election; former Governors of Ondo, Jigawa, Cross River, Olusegun Mimiko, Sule Lamido, Donald Duke and Liyel Imoke, respectively, said, \u201cWe thank you (Obasanjo) for the service you rendered and the great work you have done in the PDP as the first president.\n\n\u201cYour period as president under the platform of PDP was seen as the golden era of the PDP because not only did you grow the economy to be the biggest economy in Africa, you were able to eradicate Nigeria from slavery by negotiating and cancelling so much of our foreign debts that would have made it very difficult to run the country.\u201d\n\nBut, responding to Iyorchia Ayu\u2019s comments, former President Obasanjo, who earlier held a closed-door meeting with the PDP National officers, ruled out his possible return to the PDP and partisan politics, saying emphatically that he is no more in partisan politics and will not return to the PDP.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have been with the party right from inception. whatever I do in my own life because I became president on the platform of PDP. PDP will continue to be part of the history of my life.\n\nRead also: Wike, Makinde, Ayu, other PDP governors talk tough\n\n\u201cBut having said that, the day that in my ward I decided to tear my PDP card was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP, and that day I vowed that I will not be a member of any political party again, but I will remain a statesman in Nigeria, in West Africa, in Africa and indeed in the world.\u201d\n\nBut, advised Ayu on what to do as he said,\n\n\u201cYour (Ayu\u2019s) case is like the case of Idi Amin of Uganda. Idi Amin came to me and he said \u2018my brother, you have an Africa load and it is on your shoulder, I pray God will help you carry the Africa load\u2019.\n\n\u201cIyocha, you have PDP load with Nigeria load and it is only God that can help you to carry this load which of course, I believe if God gives you a responsibility, he will also give you the wherewithal to be able to carry that responsibility.\n\n\u201cIn my hope which is also some people\u2019s disappointment is that some of you who knew how things were done 21 years ago are still there but then some people will say here if you knew how it was done 21 years ago why have you not consistently be doing it? I think you can answer that, I will not answer for you, but if you ask me, I retired 14 years ago and I remain retired and",

          "title": "Wanted! Private sector player as president in 2023",
          "text": "As aspirants are now jostling to succeed incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, some analysts are wondering why private sector players are not showing interest to rescue the country from its current socio-economic and political morass.\n\nSo far, the majority of those who have declared their ambition for the presidency are career politicians.\n\nThe pundits have also urged well-meaning Nigerians to throw their weight behind the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the next round of elections would change the sad narrative.\n\nOne of the analysts, Henry Anya, a political scientist, wondered why some powerful private sector organisations in the country, such as Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN); Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), among others have not deemed it fit to galvanize toward ensuring that one of their own strives to succeed President Buhari.\n\n\u201cIs anything wrong if Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG), Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), and some other private sector players sponsor one of their members?\n\n\u201cThe major problem with the country is economic in nature. Any leader that gets it right here would have solved 90 percent of Nigeria\u2019s problem, and I wonder why those who know this fact have consistently decided to allow people who know little or nothing about the economy to decide the fate of over 200 million Nigerians,\u201d Anya said.\n\nAnya regretted that Nigeria, like Venezuela, is wallowing in abject poverty despite huge oil endowment, as a result of bad leadership.\n\n\u201cSome time ago, I read an article \u2018Averting Road to Venezuela,\u2019 written by Femi Adesina, a special adviser on media and publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari. He said, \u2018from a land flowing with milk and honey, what are the characteristics of Venezuelan life today? Hyperinflation. Starvation. Diseases. Crime and high mortality rates. Massive emigration, the worst in the history of the country.\n\nAnd half of the story has never yet been told. By 2017, over 75percent of the population had reportedly lost 8 kg (19 lbs) due to hunger. There are interminable food queues, and people even cross the borders, looking for sustenance. At least 94percent live in grinding poverty, more than 10percent (3.4 million) have left the country, and 25percent needed one form of humanitarian assistance or the other.\u2019 That is exactly Nigeria\u2019s case today because competent people are shying away from politics,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria has many lessons to learn from France, the United States of America, and some African countries, including South Africa, where private sector-groomed leaders are in charge.\n\nExamples from other lands\n\nWith the 2023 general election around the corner, concerned citizens are wondering if the private sector players can be given a chance as they appear to be the leadership magic Nigeria needs.\n\nOf course, the likes of Donald Trump, former president of the United States of America, Emmanuel Macron, President of France, and even Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, all came from the private sector, amid impressive impacts on their respective countries.\n\nFrom shifting his family\u2019s business from residential units in Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan projects, and later to a conglomerate, comprising real estate, hotel, media, showbiz among others, Donald Trump, who is worth over $2 billion, replicated his business success skills in White House, as America ousted him not because of mismanagement as the economy even grew more under him.\n\nThe intrigue is that Trump has been a business mogul all his life and needed not to be a career politician to lead America. But such hardly happens in Nigeria as most successful business people are seen as financial supporters to political parties and not fit for running for offices.\n\nIn the case of France, the choice of Emmanuel Macron as president was because of the European youngest president\u2019s leadership qualities.\n\nWhile Trump moved from being a hotel developer to the president, Macron moved from being an inspector of finances, investment banker, and business mogul to becoming the French president.\n\nOn the other hand, Boris Johnson had been a journalist all his life, and a very influential one, whose opinions were always reckoned with. No wonder Margret Thatcher, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, discovered him and brought him closer to government.\n\nAt home in Africa, there are examples too.\n\nCyril Ramaphosa, president of South Africa, led the country out of recession-induced by the bad policies and corruption of Jacob Zuma, the former president, who is serving jail terms for his corruption charges.\n\nDespite the impact of the pandemic, South Africa, the continent\u2019s most industrialized country, saw its gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.2 percent in the second quarter of 2021, a feat that improved and was sustained through 2021.\n\nHowever, the seeming quality leadership by Ramaphosa is coming from his wealth of experience in the private sector.\n\nFrom being an executive chairman of Shanduka Group, a company he founded, chairman of Bidvest, and MTN, non-executive director at Macsteel Holdings, Alexander Forbes and Standard Bank, as well as Non-Executive joint Chairman of Mondi, Ramaphosa has long before his emergence as the president garnered leadership skills for the biggest office in his country.\n\nThe Zambian experience\n\nIn an interview with BusinessDay last year following the defeat of a sitting president, Edgar Lungu by Hakainde Hichilema, a businessman, a Corporate Lawyer-turned Entrepreneur, Monica Musonda, said of him: \u201cI think we are willing to bank on someone who has not been a career politician; someone who wears a different lens sees things slightly differently. I think the question yet to be seen as you know is how he will manage all the social issues. But for the most part I think what we\u2019re willing to do in Zambia is now, try a different approach for a better result. So, I think we are optimistic; we recognised he is a very disciplined person; we are hoping for a very disciplined team, and people who will focus much more on the people\u2019s agenda and not on their self-agenda.\u201d\n\nAnalysts\u2019 views\n\nChijioke J. Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, says Nigeria will experience a robust economy, peaceful and better country if private sector players are allowed to rule the country come 2023.\n\n\u201cTruly, the private sector is making Nigeria proud. They keep laundering our bad image out there and have shown leadership across different sectors. So, giving them an opportunity to lead the country is the way out of our chronic bad leadership problem,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Aliko Dangote, Tony Elumelu, Jim Ovia, Cosmas Maduka, Sam Ohuabunwa, Afolabi Taiwo, among others have started their companies here and have expanded to the UK, USA and other parts of the world, where they employ foreigners. If you hand over the leadership of the country to them, they will do well because they have business principles that also apply to running a country. It is all about managing people and resources,\u201d the former lawmaker said.\n\nBut Ifewodor Ogala, a retired Naval officer, who couldn\u2019t compete with career politicians in Bayelsa State during the last gubernatorial election, noted that the Nigerian political class will not allow thriving private sector to lead the country because it will bring sanity to the system and deny them many opportunities, as leaders from the private sector will use business principles to rule \u2013 accountability, merit and \u201cno godfatherism.\u201d\n\nRead also: INEC to release 2023 elections timetable after assent to electoral act \u2013 Yakubu\n\nAccording to Ogala, \u201cPeople from the private sector appointed in positions by the government always do well. But to get them into political leadership positions is the problem. To do that, we need to bridge the process of electing them, probably by adopting them as consensus candidates, which is difficult in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut Bukola Aderemi, an ex-banker and hopeful political aspirant for Ogun State House of Assembly said that the country has been having bad leaders because the electorates have failed to defend their votes and also to make them count.\n\n\u201cI was unhappy when an unpopular candidate emerged the winner at the primaries and went ahead to win the Federal Constituency seat in my state in 2015, same repeated in a by-election. It happened because the voters sold out, and if they did not, why didn\u2019t they defend their votes at the pools,\u201d she queried.\n\nSpeaking further, she noted that sustained agitations or standing up to intimidations by security agents during polls, will always secure the votes, but the reserves are usually the case because many fear for their lives.\n\n\u201cLook at how Edo people stood their ground to save the state from the grip of Oshomhole; Anambra resisted the Federal Government; Bayelsa also did the same. We can insist on who we want, reject their money, stand up to security agents and go for a candidate that can deliver. This will make people join any party because it will no longer be the party but the credibility of the candidate that will win the election,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking at the array of aspirants already on parade to become president in 2023, Umelahi noted that the first to declare are usually not the ones to get the tickets because of political permutations, realignment of interests, and powers in later weeks to come.\n\n\u201cI think there are a few good ones among them. The likes of Kingsley Moghalu, Sam Ohuabunwa, and others from the private sector, who have proven themselves, should be given a chance,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nOgala thinks that more credible aspirants will emerge later, but that old politicians who have been part of the reason the country is backward should not be given a chance.\n\n\u201cLet younger people with sound backgrounds come out this time, they may not have money to spend, but somehow things will turn around in 2023 because Nigerians are wiser now. We cannot afford the same people, same thinking, same mandate, and same attitude again. 2023 should not be about party but credibility,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also thinks that Nigeria has many lessons to learn from France, the United States of America, and even South Africa, where private sector-groomed leaders are in charge.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump was never a politician, but the Republicans wooed him because of his achievements in the business and corporate world. We can do that and see the difference. It must not always be old politicians or retired generals,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitical Analyst, Kunle OKunade said despite the difficult political terrain of the country, and if their record in the private sector is taken into consideration, an individual in the private sector may perform better, especially in management, public accountability, and policy execution if given the opportunity to rule the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is not easy here, you know the kind of politics we play here, and can they risk it? Ordinarily, those that have succeeded in their chosen careers or businesses are supposed to be considered good for public leadership positions like the president, governor, and the rest, but what is noticeable in this clime is that they would rather want to play a supporting role by financing political aspirants and candidates into offices.\n\n\u201cAlthough, the private sector players influence public policies, especially if they play a key role in the emergence of the political office holder. It will be appropriate for Nigerians to give a private sector operator a chance to run the affairs of this nation so as to test the argument for private-sector managers\u2019 involvement in Nigeria politics.\n\n\u201cThe impact such can make would be in the area of sustainable public policy. The success of a government can be measured through the impact its policies have on the general public. I will charge those in the business world to get involved actively in politics and not be financiers only.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, public affairs commentator and lecturer in Anchor University Lagos, Dele Jackson said that a private sector player can do well if given the opportunity to rule, adding that examples abound across the world, but warned that such candidates must be dynamic and able to mix with youths.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think the array of aspirants hoping to contest the 2023 election, particularly the likes of Tinubu and Atiku can move our country forward. On the other hand, we have seen Nigerians who have done well in the private sector; however, the Nigerian political space and its dynamics might not enable them to succeed, if they decided to run for the presidency,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn other countries of the world with reference to the United States, the political space and its dynamics have enabled the likes of Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan and many others who did well in the private sector to contest for the presidency and advance the course of their country.\n\n\u201cI believe whoever will transform the political and economic fortunes must have a blend of political and economic intelligence and skills. The candidate must be dynamic and able to mix with the young population.\u201d\n\nKen Ike, a professor of Economics, said private sector players can help solve myriads of Nigeria\u2019s challenge but what is required mostly is a formidable team that can deliver the needed dividends.\n\n\u201cThe country is made up of a wide thread of professionals and it is very important to engage that diversity of professionals. Because the economy is so pivotal to our development there is a need for people with great knowledge in economic management to have a preponderance of them into leadership to be able to steer the economy in a positive direction.\n\n\u201cIt is in that count but not by any means exclusive territory. You are talking about leadership; leadership is actually simpler than how complex we make it to be. It is just your ability to get the right people; square pegs in square holes. To get the right people with the right experience to help create the policy, robust implementation plan, and carry them out.\n\n\u201cSo you may have the best man sitting there but if the team is not up to it, we will still be back to square one. You could have a Ph.D., you could be a Professor in economics, if you don\u2019t choose the right team then the political economy will be just like Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said: \u2018if you try to fight corruption, corruption will fight back. This is a challenge for us.\n\n\u201cIt could work but it is not by any means a panacea for salvaging an economy. Like I told you, the best brain and experienced person can mount that position of President but if he doesn\u2019t exercise the wisdom, because you can\u2019t be everywhere. I don\u2019t see how much of being everywhere you have seen in Buhari, he just sits there and tells the manager, gives the marching order. So, it is by your ability to get the right team and it is not a one-man job. We want to grow strong institutions,\u201d Ike said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to grow strongmen because it is strong institutions that will rise to defend, support and lead. So, it is not about individuals. It is by the individual having the discernment to choose the right team that will do what he wants them to do and you need them in different ministries, different agencies. If you want to have a purposeful economy, you have to choose the right people that will focus on the correct agenda to deliver.\u201d\n\nTersoo Ende, an economist, reasoned that the private sector players could be the answer to what Nigeria needs right now for the economy to foster that energy from individual ownership of means of production into the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cBy bringing in this culture, most of the Nigerian economic sectors will start working properly, thereby creating more productivity which will lead to improvement in the balance of payment accompanied by a favourable exchange rate. When all this is put on the ground, jobs would no longer be scarce,\u201d he said.\n\nA former governor of Borno State and serving Senator, Kassim Shettima shared this view when he said in Abuja recently: \u201cAt the top of our expectations from Nigeria\u2019s next president should be mastery of the dynamics of the modern economy, testified leadership skills and competence, and, very significantly, sensitivity to the complexities of Nigerian sociology.\u201d\n\nA tall dream for Nigeria now \u2013 Agbakoba\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay on the manner of candidates to expect in 2023, Olisa Agbakoba, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said: \u201cWhat one wants to see now that the present government is in its closing moments, is the presidential candidate that will emerge from whatever party; I would like to hear what they would say about insecurity; I would like to hear what they would say about fighting corruption and what tools that they would recommend; because it is from the programme of the presidential candidate that you have an expectation.\n\n\u201cWhat the prognosis shows for Nigeria is a long-distance situation of contagion or chaos. We are going to be in it for a long time. Do you think that 2023 will clear things? It is a long-distance race. Our votes will start to count, maybe, from 2049; unless we are able to get a good president.\u201d",

This is not done because we are in election year, we have been doing this in the last ten months and I can assure our people that nothing will stop this.\n\n\u201cWe have proved our capacity and capability to ensure the sustenance of this scheme contrary to what some people were saying that we won\u2019t be able to sustain it, but today, we have proved them wrong.\n\n\u201cWe are not unmindful of the local industries that are into food productions, for instance, last month, we distributed Ofada rice locally produced and sourced from our local farmers and by next month, we are looking at another local food that would be distributed to the vulnerable citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is to encourage local entrepreneurs because our focus is to grow local productions, improve on our productivity and support agro-allied industries to grow for the overall development of our dear State\u201d, he added.\n\nAlso, the Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Hon. Lekan Badmus, lauded the Governor for placing the scheme on his priority list.\n\nBadmus disclosed that the market approach adopted to further strengthen the distribution of the foods had earned the government applause as beneficiaries were excited and prayed for its continuity.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, during the official flag off of this Scheme, Mr. Governor actually mentioned that the programme will run throughout his tenure in office. And to actualise this, Mr Governor has actually shown capacity and genuineness, and you will agree with me that foods are being shared among the 30,000 vulnerable citizens in the State on monthly basis.\n\n\u201cWe have actually reached out to over 50 markets in six Federal Constituencies in addition to the social register adopted for distribution and the feedback has been very encouraging as many of the beneficiaries have lauded the government on the initiative.\n\n\u201cIn developing this further, Mr Governor has also emphasised on local contents which we have been doing and we are looking at the possibility of getting more local staple foods as part of efforts to boost the economy of the State, encourage local entrepreneurs and farmers in particular.\n\n\u201cInitially people were scared on how we are going to finance and sustain this, but Mr Governor has been able to show his financial prowess in ensuring that this has been successfully and it is my firm belief that this is going to be sustained for as long as we are in government\u201d, he added.",

That is why we are appealing to INEC to make sure that our votes count.\n\n\u201cINEC should not allow selfish politicians to rig the election and thereby put us in another round of suffering again. We need a serious political change in this FCT and we want to achieve that through the coming elections.\n\n\u201cWe want to also use this opportunity to advice residents and natives of Abuja to resist any financial inducement from politicians to buy their votes and conscience. They should resist financial temptations from selfish politicians.\n\n\u201cThey should know that selling their votes is selling their birthright for another three years because politicians who buy their votes do not care about their future. We should be wise this period.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe want to also advise voters and party agents not to depart the voting areas until after results are collated, counted and recorded.

          "title": "APC tackles Wike: Forget politics, fight Port Harcourt soot",
          "text": "The Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, says despite the best efforts of the party to discourage the politicization of the fight against soot enveloping Port Harcourt and endangering the lives of residents in the short and long term, it is becoming very obvious that the Rivers State governor, Chief Nyesom Wike, is hell bent more on reaping political dividends from it than pursuing an altruistic fight. Our concern is that such a motive will ultimately stall the effort.\n\nAccording to the opposition party in the state, \u201cin defending the many years that it took the governor to wake up from a deep sleep over the soot challenge, it is disheartening to find the state governor blaming everyone else but himself for doing nothing over the past 6 years in addressing the deadly soot. When the governor is not blaming security agents, he is blaming the federal government.\u201d\n\nA statement signed by APC\u2019s Spokesman Senibo Chris Finebone noted that , \u201cwhereas the accusation against some security personnel may have some substance worthy of investigation, it is rather most unintelligent for the governor who heads a subnational government to blame the federal government for inaction on the deadly soot in Rivers State when the State government has not initiated any concrete action requiring synergy with the federal government. Indeed, government-to-government business is not conducted based on off-the-cuff comments of a governor at functions or events. Can the Rivers State Government provide proof of Save Our Souls (SOS) memos initiated by it and addressed to the FG through Federal Ministry of Environment calling for the central government\u2019s intervention on the matter? That is how government-to-government business is conducted.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cVery significant is that, after all said and done, the fact that a State under the ravaging whirlwind of soot does not have a sitting Cabinet Commissioner for Environment smells real bad and is self-indicting. It means that the very dangerous health risk will not be routinely brought by official memo to be discussed at the State Executive Council meetings except if the governor remembers to table it. Apparently, this has been the sad situation so far.\n\n\u201cTruth is that the governor never considered the soot descending on Port Harcourt and environs important enough for 6 years until now.\n\n\u201cAll the APC is saying is that the governor should be honest enough to take responsibility for doing nothing for over 6 years even as citizens cried for help.\n\nThe governor should not merely go after grasshoppers while leaving the elephants to continue with their alternative economy that inflicts havoc on the lives of residents of the State.\n\nIt should not be seen as a ready opportunity to rope in innocent political opponents particularly now that the local government chairmen are major drivers of the fight.\n\n\u201cAPC will always support any genuine and honest steps taken by all levels of government be it the federal, state and local to stem this very horrendous soot ravaging our people and residents of Rivers State especially Port Harcourt. Our only concern is that any attempt to use it for political witch-hunting of opponents will backfire and defeat the purpose.\n\n\u201cThe Rivers State Government should also ensure that it must not claim to be fighting illegal refining while, at the same time, its biggest contractor (Julius Berger) is providing a huge ready market for relatively cheaper illegally refined Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) or diesel killing our people. That would be classical grand folly!\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, says despite the best efforts of the party to discourage the politicization of the fight against soot enveloping Port Harcourt and endangering the lives of residents in the short and long term, it is becoming very obvious that the Rivers State governor, Chief Nyesom Wike, is hell bent more on reaping political dividends from it than pursuing an altruistic fight. Our concern is that such a motive will ultimately stall the effort.\n\nAccording to the opposition party in the state, \u201cin defending the many years that it took the governor to wake up from a deep sleep over the soot challenge, it is disheartening to find the state governor blaming everyone else but himself for doing nothing over the past 6 years in addressing the deadly soot. When the governor is not blaming security agents, he is blaming the federal government.\u201d\n\nA statement signed by APC\u2019s Spokesman Senibo Chris Finebone noted that , \u201cwhereas the accusation against some security personnel may have some substance worthy of investigation, it is rather most unintelligent for the governor who heads a subnational government to blame the federal government for inaction on the deadly soot in Rivers State when the State government has not initiated any concrete action requiring synergy with the federal government. Indeed, government-to-government business is not conducted based on off-the-cuff comments of a governor at functions or events. Can the Rivers State Government provide proof of Save Our Souls (SOS) memos initiated by it and addressed to the FG through Federal Ministry of Environment calling for the central government\u2019s intervention on the matter? That is how government-to-government business is conducted.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cVery significant is that, after all said and done, the fact that a State under the ravaging whirlwind of soot does not have a sitting Cabinet Commissioner for Environment smells real bad and is self-indicting. It means that the very dangerous health risk will not be routinely brought by official memo to be discussed at the State Executive Council meetings except if the governor remembers to table it. Apparently, this has been the sad situation so far.\n\n\u201cTruth is that the governor never considered the soot descending on Port Harcourt and environs important enough for 6 years until now.\n\n\u201cAll the APC is saying is that the governor should be honest enough to take responsibility for doing nothing for over 6 years even as citizens cried for help.\n\nThe governor should not merely go after grasshoppers while leaving the elephants to continue with their alternative economy that inflicts havoc on the lives of residents of the State.\n\nIt should not be seen as a ready opportunity to rope in innocent political opponents particularly now that the local government chairmen are major drivers of the fight.\n\n\u201cAPC will always support any genuine and honest steps taken by all levels of government be it the federal, state and local to stem this very horrendous soot ravaging our people and residents of Rivers State especially Port Harcourt. Our only concern is that any attempt to use it for political witch-hunting of opponents will backfire and defeat the purpose.\n\n\u201cThe Rivers State Government should also ensure that it must not claim to be fighting illegal refining while, at the same time, its biggest contractor (Julius Berger) is providing a huge ready market for relatively cheaper illegally refined Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) or diesel killing our people. That would be classical grand folly!\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Sometime in 2017, the world apex bank introduced a performance based programme that would make them monitor and rate the fiscal performance of states.\n\nTo that effect, world bank entered into a mutual agreement with the Federal Government which gave birth to a programme known as The State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) Programme.\n\nThe rationale behind the State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) Programme is informed by the current serious fiscal challenges faced by the states with many unable to pay backlog of salary arrears of several months due to poor fiscal governance occasioned by high cost of governance, profligacy poor revenue drive amongst others.\n\nMost states with the exception of a few have weak fiscal transparency and accountability structure characterized by unpublished budgets & financial statements, lack of timely budget implementation reports, very high budget deviation (between 30% to 55%) and their Citizens are never engaged in the budget process. State Executives believe they are not accountable to the citizens and hence do not need their input in major policy decision-making processes particularly budget processes where everybody is kept in the dark.\n\nThis Programme was WorldBank\u2019s strategy for rating the fiscal governance of all 36 States of Nigeria so as to encourage fiscal transparency and integrity by rewarding such state with grants and/or technical support.\n\nHence under the \u2018Program for Result\u2019 (PforR), states that meet the ranking criteria will be rewarded with a performance based grant, whereas those that fail to meet the criteria loses the reward.\n\nThe PforR component is ex-ante open to 36 states and FCT for participation. However, in order, to be eligible to access the annual performance-based grants, states must achieve the Eligibility Criteria (EC) for the performance year. The Program allows for different entry points by states. States not achieving the EC in Year 1 won\u2019t access Year 1 performance-based grants; however, they can aim to join the Program in Year 2 or 3.\n\nEligibility Criteria (EC): For each year of the Program, states will need to publish on a timely basis the annual approved state budgets and annual audited financial statements. In years 3 and 4 of the Program, states are further required to align with international best practices through: (1) the use of the national chart of accounts/budget classification system, which is GFS compliant, to prepare the states\u2019 annual budgets and thus foster comparability of budget classifications across the federation; and (2) states\u2019 audited financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).\n\nThe Performance year include;\n\nYEAR 1; 1st Jan 2018- 1st Jan 2019\n\nYEAR 2; 1st Jan 2019- 1st Jan 2020\n\nYEAR 3; 1st Jan 2020- 1st Jan 2021\n\nYEAR 4; 1st Jan 2021-1st Jan 2022.\n\nStates who meet up with the Performance, Eligibility Criteria for a particular year will be awarded a grant of 2million USD and as such qualify for the next year, whereas states that does not meet up with the criteria for a particular year can reapply to join the program the next year.\n\nImo State in 2018-2019 year of Performance Eligibility Criteria review did not meet up with the criteria hence was ineligible for the grant.\n\nWhereas from 2019 till 2021 Imo State has met all the performance criteria for Fiscal Performance in Governance and has received the grant of 2m USD twice.\n\nThis rating by WORLD BANK EXPOSES UZODIMMA\u2019S GOVERNMENT ON FISCAL PERFORMANCE IN GOVERNANCE and further reveals the level of Transparency, Integrity and Prudence at which Hope Uzodimma is managing the resources of the state thus growing her internal revenue base. Little wonder 75% of the 2022 budget of Imo State is projected to be funded with IGR.\n\nWith such signature Performance Ranking by a globally reputable organization like World bank, it is convenient to say that Imo State under Hope Uzodimma is performing creditably well even at a global propensity.\n\nUnegbu Onyedikachi Victor-Wallace\n\nWrites from Owerri",

It comes amid high tensions between Moscow and the West over Russia\u2019s designs on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe disinformation spread by the British Foreign Office is more evidence that it is the NATO countries, led by the Anglo-Saxons, who are escalating tensions around Ukraine,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Telegram messaging app Sunday. \u201cWe call on the British Foreign Office to stop provocative activities, stop spreading nonsense.\u201d\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the information \u201cshines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking.\u201d\n\nTruss urged Russia to \u201cdeescalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy,\u201d and reiterated Britain\u2019s view that \u201cany Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.\u201d\n\nBritain has sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine as part of efforts to bolster its defenses against a potential Russian attack.\n\nAmid diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis, U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace is expected to meet Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu for talks in Moscow. No timing has been given for the meeting, which would be the first U.K.-Russia bilateral defense talks since 2013.\n\nThe U.S. has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent months to unify its European allies against a new Russian invasion of Ukraine. The White House called the U.K. government assessment \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and said it stands with the duly elected Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cThis kind of plotting is deeply concerning,\u201d National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said. \u201cThe Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe assessment came as President Joe Biden spent Saturday at the presidential retreat Camp David outside of Washington huddling with his senior national security team about the Ukraine situation.

          "title": "Q/Final Place at Stake as Super Eagles Expect Tough Battle with Covid-Ravaged Tunisia on Sunday",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s manager Augustine Eguavoen says he expects a tough duel between his Super Eagles and the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in Sunday\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations Round of 16 encounter in Garoua.\n\nTunisia\u2019s campaign has been somewhat ravaged by positive COVID tests and the team only qualified for the knockout stage as one of the best losers, finishing in third place behind The Gambia and Mali, and winning only one of their three matches while losing the other two.\n\n\u201cI expect a very tough game against the Tunisians. Our group will not be lulled into any sense of superiority over any team here until we do the business on the field. Tunisia is a big name in African football and we must acknowledge that, despite the manner in which they reached this stage.\n\n\u201cWe have watched some of their games and from what we know of them in the distant past and in lucid memory, they are never a team to take for granted.\u201d\n\nEguavoen\u2019s 51 caps for Nigeria did not include an encounter with Tunisia, but he was head coach of the Super Eagles when Nigeria upended the Carthage Eagles on penalty shootout in Port Said in Egypt 16 years ago to send the Cup holders out of the tournament at the quarter final stage.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge, huge game and a memorable one for me. The match ended 1-1 in regulation and extra time and we had to go into penalties. We lost two of our first three kicks or something like that and then bounced back when our goalkeeper (Vincent Enyeama) stopped two of their kicks. It was a sweet victory,\u201d Eguavoen said.\n\nAt the Al Masry Stadium on 4th February 2006, Obinna Nsofor scored for Nigeria before Karim Haggui levelled for the Cup holders. In the shootout, Joseph Yobo and Yusuf Ayila missed as Chedli and Ben Achour did for Tunisia. Taye Taiwo, Nsofor and Obafemi Martins scored, as did Namouchi, Guemamdia and Jose Clayton for Tunisia. In sudden death, John Mikel Obi and goalkeeper Enyeama scored for Nigeria as did goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel and Hadj Massaoud for Tunisia, but after Nwankwo Kanu scored for Nigeria, Riadh Bouazizi saw his kick saved by Enyeama.\n\nIn dim and distant memory, Tunisia reached the final round of the 1978 FIFA World Cup African series after an own goal by Godwin Odiye in Lagos on 12th November 1977 eliminated Nigeria, but the following year, Nigeria earned the bronze medals of the 11th AFCON when Tunisia abandoned the match in the 42nd minute following an equalizer by Baba Otu Mohammed. Nigera were awarded the match 2-0.\n\nIn 1980, both countries tied 2-2 on aggregate in a Spain 82 World Cup qualifying fixture, with Nigeria proceeding after penalty shootout. In 1985, Tunisia edged their 1986 World Cup qualifying fixture 2-1 on aggregate \u2013 a lone goal by Okey Isima cancelled out with a two-goal blitz in the first 15 minutes of the return inside the Stade El Menzah in Tunis.\n\nIn recent and decent memory, Nigeria edged their opening encounter of the 2000 Africa Cup of Nations 4-2 in Lagos, with Jay Jay Okocha and Victor Ikpebe earning a brace each. In 2009, a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying fixture ended 0-0 and 2-2 in Tunis and Abuja, and in 2019 Nigeria won the bronze medals of the 32nd AFCON 1-0 in Cairo at the expense of the Carthage Eagles.\n\nTheir most recent encounter was a friendly game in Austria in October 2020, which ended 1-1 with Nigeria\u2019s goal scored by Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nOn Sunday at the Stade Roumd\u00e9 Adjia, Nigeria will file out with three wins in three from their group phase campaign. The Tunisians were only able to defeat Mauritania while losing to Mali and The Gambia. Both countries are led by indigenous coaches. Mondher Kebaier will sit on the Tunisians\u2019 bench.\n\nThe match will be Eguavoen\u2019s 16th for Nigeria across three stints, during which he has walked off the pitch victorious in 13 of the previous 15, with only two narrow defeats. He is also the only man to have coached Nigeria to win all three group phase matches at the AFCON, achieving this in both his AFCON odysseys in 2006 and 2022.\n\nThe usual in-tournament extra incentives \u2013 a practice entrenched over the decades \u2013 have started flowing in for the Eagles. Billionaire businessman Femi Otedola has dedicated the naira equivalent of $250,000 for the team to win the trophy, just as airline owner Allen Onyema has promised N50million if the team marches to the final on 6th February and is triumphant.\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele says the CACOVID (a coalition of private sector companies set up to fight COVID pandemic in Nigeria) will shell out the sum of $120,000 for the six goals already scored by the Eagles in Cameroon, and $50,000 (naira equivalent) for every goal in the Round of 16 clash with Tunisia.\n\nAirline owner Onyema had earlier promised the team the sum of N10million for every goal.\n\nCosta Rica 2022: Falconets confident as they battle Cameroon in Douala\n\nNigeria\u2019s U20 girls, Falconets are buoyed by the performance of the Super Eagles at the ongoing 33rd Africa Cup of Nations, and say they are motivated for a great result when they take on their Cameroonian counterparts in a FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup qualifying match in Douala on Saturday.\n\nCoach Chris Danjuma watched his girls limber up briefly to shake off jet lag following their arrival in Douala on Thursday, and have been scheduled for a feel of the match venue \u2013 Stade Japoma de Douala \u2013 on Friday evening.\n\n\u201cWe are highly motivated by the performance of the Super Eagles so far at the AFCON here in Cameroon. It is a huge tonic for us to go all out and overwhelm our opponents,\u201d Danjuma said.\n\nProlific scorers Mercy Idoko, Flourish Sebastine and Esther Onyenezide are among Danjuma\u2019s 23-woman army for Saturday\u2019s encounter with the Young Lionesses. It is the penultimate round of the African qualifying series for the tournament scheduled for Costa Rica in the month of August.\n\nNFF condoles 3SC over death of Rasheed Balogun\n\nThe Nigeria Football Federation has commiserated with the Management and Players of Shooting Stars Sports Club of Ibadan over the death of the club\u2019s General Manager, Mr Rasheed Balogun.\n\nBalogun, a highly experienced and respected club administrator, died in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Thursday night.\n\nGeneral Secretary of the NFF, Dr Mohammed Sanusi said: \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we have learned of the passing on of Rasheed Balogun, someone we have known over the years as an energetic, dedicated and charismatic club administrator. He was passionate about the game and was a frontline actor in the country\u2019s domestic game for several decades. His death at this time is heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire Nigeria Football family, we pray for the repose of his soul and that God will grant those he has left behind, including the 3SC family, the fortitude to bear the big loss.\u201d",
