          "title": "Gateway Hotel Ota: Multimillion investment rots, houses rodents as Daniel, Amosun\u2019s cold war ruins Ogun legacy project",
          "text": "DAUD OLATUNJI writes on the current state of desolation of what was once the pride of Ogun State, the Gateway Hotel, Ota, owing to a political war among the state\u2019s gladiators\n\nDespite its strategic location and proximity to Lagos, the commercial centre of Nigeria, the Gateway Hotel, Ota, one of the three hotels established by the late former governor of Ogun State, Chief Olabisi Onabanjo, has been abandoned and is currently in ruins.\n\nThe Gateway Hotel, Ota, is located less than 100 metres away from the old Sango tollgate, a location that serves as the boundary between Lagos and Ogun states. The once magnificent edifice sits on the right when coming into Sango from Lagos.\n\nThe administration of Onabanjo, who was the first democratically-elected governor of the state between October 1979 and December 1983, built three hotels in the 1980s while holding sway on the platform of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria to demonstrate equal distribution of wealth in Ogun State.\n\nThe administration had situated the hotels in the three senatorial districts in the state \u2013 Egba, Yewa/Awori and Ijebu.\n\nThe one for Ijebu was situated in Ijebu-Ode and has now become Equity Resort Hotel; the one for Egba is situated in the Kuto area of Abeokuta, the state capital, and has become the Park Inn by Radisson, while the one for Yewa/Awori remains the Gateway Hotel, Ota, which is located along the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.\n\nFindings show that the Gateway Hotel, Ota, is the biggest of the three with 350 rooms and suites.\n\nThe three were built as five-star rated hotel complexes with world-class facilities. They had beautiful landscapes, Olympic-size swimming pools, conference rooms, event halls, tennis courts and shopping plazas.\n\nAfter some years, the administration of Otunba Gbenga Daniel between 2003 and 2011 gave out the three hotels to private investors as concession for a period of 25 years.\n\nDaniel claimed that it gave out the facilities as concession because they were being run at a loss. He lamented that since they were established, only N27m had been realised from the three hotels.\n\nEight years later, the Ibikunle Amosun administration, which was in the saddle between 2011 and 2019, set up a judicial commission of inquiry to look into the state properties sold or given out as concessions by his predecessor.\n\nThe report of the commission was published by the state government in February 2012. It was established that Gateway Hotel, Ota, was given to MIDC Limited as a concession and sub-leased to ARTEE Industries Limited.\n\nThe report added that the concessionaire took over in 2009 with a promise to complete the refurbishment of the facility within 18 months, but allegedly failed to do anything after two and a half years.\n\nWhile implementing the recommendations of the commission, Amosun terminated the concession.\n\nUnfortunately, the current situation of the hotel shows that apart from the fact that the massive building is standing in a jungle of overgrown weeds and trees, the whole building has become dilapidated.\n\nSome of the luxury items, including the decorative lights in the halls and conference rooms, have been looted.\n\nA former worker in the hotel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was nothing left in the building that could remind anyone of what it used to look like.\n\nHe said all appliances, windows and doors, including their frames, as well as air conditioners and fans had disappeared.\n\nThe cinema section of the hotel has become a dusty dark room with no relic of its original state.\n\nIt was also gathered that since the building was left to rot and became an open space for anyone to access, miscreants had made away with every valuable item they could lay their hands on.\n\nGiving the historical facts of the hotel, an indigene of Ota, Kayode Taiwo, told our correspondent that the hotel was established in 1982 by the late Onabanjo and had 350 rooms and an Olympic-sized swimming pool.\n\nAccording to him, the hotel had a main banquet hall, three conference halls, cinema halls, shopping mall, a penthouse, car park for over 1,000 vehicles and two sets of power generators.\n\n\u201cGateway Hotel, Ota, is strategically located on the hilly side of the Ota-Lagos boundary close to the popular Ilo-Awela River,\u201d he explained.\n\nTaiwo said the moribund facility had a general manager, food and beverages manager, admin manager, finance/account manager, as well as engineering and corporate affairs departments.\n\n\u201cHistorically, the hotel was strategically located to douse the agitation of the Ota people over their request to merge with Lagos State,\u201d Taiwo added.\n\nOn what the Ota people had lost to the mismanagement of the edifice, Taiwo said, \u201cThe hotel, at its peak, provided huge economic platforms for small businesses, theatre performance and film making, including musicals.\n\n\u201cIt also provided employment for young people in and around Ota.\n\n\u201cGateway Hotel, as an edifice, provided beautiful aesthetic value to the environment and was a huge place for tourism.\n\n\u201cServices provided during festivals include relaxation, swimming, keep fit and performances by artistes were regular getaway opportunities for corporate and individual guests.\n\n\u201cTrading value chain provided for small and big merchants vis-\u00e0-vis supply of beverages, farm produce, dry cleaning services and horticulture, among others.\u201d\n\nDefending the Daniel administration, a former Managing Director, Gateway Holdings Limited, Gboyega Isiaka, said the concessionaire, MIDC, which acquired the hotel in Ota, was not fully prepared.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe situation with the Gateway Hotel, Ota, is that the concessionaire that got the place was not as fully prepared as those that got the other two locations.\n\n\u201cWe discovered this even before we left office and we gave him a letter to the effect that he should do certain things or we would cancel the concession, and we agreed on what would be done in the place; we also issued a warning.\u201d\n\nIsiaka disclosed that due to MIDC\u2019s inability to procure funds for the project, the concessionaire entered into an agreement with Gateway Holdings and ARTEE Industries Limited, the owners and operators of the famous Park \u2018n\u2019 Shop brand.\n\nHe said ARTEE Industries Limited was granted a development lease for a term of 23 years less three days, which meant the unexpired residue of the term granted to the MIDC in respect of an area measuring approximately 2.153 hectares to be used for a shopping mall.\n\nIsiaka explained, \u201cWhat happened to Gateway Hotel, Ota, is exactly the same thing that happened to Gateway Hotel, Abeokuta, and Gateway Hotel, Ijebu-Ode. It\u2019s a concession process that I remain proud of even up till this time despite what is happening in that location (Gateway Hotel Ota).\n\n\u201cEven the day I appeared before the judicial panel, I told them that I remain proud of what we did there. Yes, there might be one or two things that probably should have been delayed or done better; there will always be things like that.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the concession process and I can say that anywhere, even when the former governor\u2019s (Ibikunle Amosun) false allegation against me was about this hotel; I was at the EFCC; I went there alone and spent almost a whole day with them; I can stand in front of anybody to say that I am proud of the concession process.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when we left office, another government got there. It is left for that government to manage the process. So, all these stories that we were the ones that sold the hotel at a cheap price are rubbish.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the plans of the current government on the moribund hotel, the Commissioner for Culture and Tourism, Dr Oluwatoyin Taiwo, said the Dapo Abiodun administration had begun the search for genuine investors.\n\nHe confirmed that the place had been messed up due to neglect by the previous administration.\n\nThe commissioner stated, \u201cWhen we came on board at the ministry that is responsible for supervising most of the hospitality industries in the state, we were saddled with the responsibility by the governor to visit most of the tourist sites and most of the properties that we have under our purview and jurisdiction as the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that the Gateway Hotel, Ota, was one of the places we visited.\n\n\u201cWe sent the Director of Tourism Development and Promotion and some of his members of staff so that they would give us the state of things despite the fact that we knew the public opinion about it. The government did not stop what it wanted to do and now decided to go there to see for ourselves the state of things. They brought back their report.\n\n\u201cWhat we realised was that the administration after that of Otunba Gbenga Daniel did nothing about it and as a result of that, we realised that a lot of the facilities that were there had been carted away; they left that place moribund and virtually all the equipment that were there have been carted away.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who did that and then the environment, only God knows the number of years that it has been abandoned, has become the dens of hooligans and we learnt that some Hausa/Fulani have started inhabiting the area.\u201d\n\nOn the plans by the Abiodun administration for the facility, Taiwo said, \u201cWhen we got the report, our plan as a government is to make sure that we resuscitate it to make it better than what we met on the ground and to also make sure that we develop it to the extent that it will have good looks that will be appealing and it will be able to complete with most of the five-star hotels that we have in the world.\n\n\u201cIn the course of doing that, what the government is trying to do is to extend the hand of fellowship to any private organisation that is ready to take it up so that at least at the end of the day, we can reach an agreement through the MoU to be able to hand it over to them, so that at the end of the day it comes back to life and is resuscitated.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to make sure that we give a private organisation an opportunity to come in; it is a potential that the government is looking towards getting an investor, who will be ready to take it up; so, that is the government\u2019s stand on that property.\u201d\n\nOn if the investor had been chosen, the commissioner stated, \u201cFor now, consultations and some other things are going on. But, as we speak, there has not been any investor that has signed on that property.\n\n\u201cWe have an agency that is handling that \u2013 Ogun Invest. It is an agency that is saddled with that responsibility of having a handshake with investors and potential investors.\u201d\n\nSeveral attempts to get reactions from those who served in Amosun\u2019s administration failed.\n\nThe former Commissioner for Commerce, Trade and Industry, Bimbo Ashiru, said he did not want to make any comment on the issue so as not to be misunderstood.\n\nThe former Commissioner for Information under Amosun, Dayo Adeneye, could not be reached as of the time of filing this report. The commissioner did not respond to a text message sent to his phone as of the time of sending this report.\n\nAlso, the former Secretary to the State Government during Amosun administration, Taiwo Adeoluwa had not replied to a text message sent to him as of the time of sending this report.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Ataga: Family hires Ozekhome, seek Justice in their son\u2019s brutal murder",
          "text": "Michael Ataga\n\nKingsley Omonobi\n\nThe family of Late Mr. Michael Usifo Ataga who was brutally murdered on the 15th of June, 2021, somewhere in Lekki, Lagos, has briefed fiery Constitutional Lawyer and renowned Human Rights Activist, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, to protect and defend the interests of the Ataga family and his teeming friends, admirers, kinsmen, and business associates, to ensure that justice is duly served in the matter and that justice is not only done but manifestly seen by the public to have been done.\n\nThe Ataga family, in its instruction letter to Chief Ozekhome, decried the low level of professionalism exhibited so far by the Police in bringing to book and prosecuting professionally, the perpetrators of this heinous crime that led to Ataga\u2019s unprovoked and cold-blooded murder.\n\nOnly a few days ago, the family of late Ataga had accused the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Hakeem Odumosu, of being complicit in an alleged attempt to protect the killers of Ataga.\n\nThe family said that they were shocked that the prosecution of the 21-year old prime suspect in Ataga\u2019s murder, one Chidinma Ojukwu of the Mass Communication Department, University of Lagos, was arraigned at a Chief Magistrate Court, Yaba, without even being informed about the arraignment coming up.\n\nThe family had also revealed that one Babalola Disu, who was arraigned for allegedly preventing the Police from performing their duties and failing to report a crime to the Police, is \u201chighly suspected to have carried out the murder\u201d.\n\nThe family premised its suspicion on information they received to the effect that Disu\u2019s short rental apartment was directly opposite the apartment where Ataga was killed.\n\nThe family narrated how the said Disu had asked that the carpenter of Air BnB should be called upon to fix his door, only for the carpenter to be told later that it was actually Usifo\u2019s door that was broken.\n\nThe family had also accused the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Mr. Odumosu, of being complicit in bungling the case of Ataga\u2019s murder through his lack of depth, thoroughness, and professionalism in his investigation of Ataga\u2019s brutal murder.\n\nIt will be recalled that Chidinma Okukwu, a 21-year old Mass Communications student of the University of Lagos, was arrested by the Police on June 23, 2021, for the alleged murder of Super TV owner, 50-year old Usifo, with whom she had a romantic relationship.\n\nUsifo had been found dead on June 15, 2021, with ghastly, multiple stab wounds all over his body, at the said short rental apartment on Adebowale Oshin Street, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, which Chidinma had personally booked.\n\nThe ghastly wounds showed evidence of sustained torture. Chidinma had voluntarily confessed in her first public outing to stabbing Usifo severally with a knife under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and withdrawing the sum of N380,000 from the victim\u2019s account with his ATM card.\n\nShe was later to backtrack on this confession in a carefully arranged televised interview, where she claimed she had allegedly acted in self-defense. Usifo was later buried on July 30, 2021, at a solemn low-key ceremony at the Ebony Vaults, Ikoyi, Lagos, after a funeral service at the Lady Perpetua Help Catholic church in Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nThe Usifo family had also decried the alleged comfortable movement to prison from court and from court back to the prison, of Chidinma in an Uber ride. The family queried why this was done without even handcuffs and without being informed of the intending arraignment.\n\nThe family also alleged that the man who had claimed to be Chidinma\u2019s father and who was also charged to the Magistrate\u2019s court for obstructing a Police investigation, was actually not Chidinma\u2019s biological father after all, but her \u201csugar daddy\u201d. The family postulated that this means that the Police had deliberately lied to it.\n\nThe family made it clear it suspects the said Disu for having a hand in Ataga\u2019s murder and wondered why he was charged for mere obstruction of Police investigation and failure to report a crime, thus being granted bail in the ridiculous term of 1 million naira only and 2 sureties in like sum.\n\nTo all other suspects involved in this dastardly act ( except Chidinma who was ordered remanded ), bail was granted by Chief Magistrate Adeola Adedayo, in the funny conditions of 1 million naira each with two sureties in like sum. The family said it could understand these over-liberal bail terms in such a heinous crime of hideous and horrific murder.\n\nThe family views these acts by the Police as a slap on their face, the face of justice, and a deliberate cover-up by the Police.\n\nThe family has therefore briefed Ozekhome and his Chambers, to take up this case with all relevant authorities, to ensure that justice is manifestly done to the memory of late Usifo through a very professional prosecution of all those involved in this heinous crime, no matter how highly placed they may be",
          "summary": "Only a few days ago, the family of late Ataga had accused the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Hakeem Odumosu, of being complicit in an alleged attempt to protect the killers of Ataga.\nThe family had also accused the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Mr. Odumosu, of being complicit in bungling the case of Ataga\u2019s murder through his lack of depth, thoroughness, and professionalism in his investigation of Ataga\u2019s brutal murder.\nThe Usifo family had also decried the alleged comfortable movement to prison from court and from court back to the prison, of Chidinma in an Uber ride.\nThe family said it could understand these over-liberal bail terms in such a heinous crime of hideous and horrific murder.\nThe family views these acts by the Police as a slap on their face, the face of justice, and a deliberate cover-up by the Police.",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Sunday said Nigeria will rise above the current security and socio-economic challenges facing it.\n\nThe Vice President stated this during a send forth service for Revd (Dr) Israel Akanji, who served as Senior Pastor and Minister- In- Charge of the First Baptist Church, Garki, Abuja, for 22 years.\n\nAccording to a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Mr Laolu Akande, Osinbajo said he is sure of healing for the country because the Spirit of God is in the land.\n\nHe spoke in a short remark he gave at the service which was also attended by the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN) Rev Olasupo Ayokunle and Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunimbe Mamora, among other dignitaries and Christian leaders.\n\nQuoting from Genesis 1, the Vice President related events surrounding the creation of heaven and earth to the nation\u2019s present challenges and the lives of great individuals.\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201cIn the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. The beginning was bleak, confused, without form, empty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is the way of the lives of some of the greatest men and women and also nations. There might be confusion, grief, trouble, darkness and fear. But even in that confusion, the Bible tells us that the Spirit of the Lord was hovering over the face of the deep. God was in the darkness, He did not run away. He is not asleep.\n\n\u201cSo, it is with our nation. Today, some things may seem bleak and grave, with insecurity, economic difficulties, but even in the midst of these problems, the Spirit of God is in this land, it is here, hovering over this nation\n\n\u201cSo, what happens next in verse three? We are told that suddenly God spoke, \u2018let there be light\u2026and there was light.\u2019 The darkness came to an end, the fear, insecurity came to an end.\n\n\u201cSo, it shall be for you and our nation. In the next verse, scripture says, God saw the light that it was good\u2026.so it shall be for you and our nation. The light will come and it shall be good, very good\u201d, he assured.\n\nThe Vice President also commended the attributes of the new President of the Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC), describing Rev Akanji as a humble and credible leader who \u201chas continued to forge pathways for peace and unity as an effective bridge builder between faiths and ethnicities, realising that Christ died for all men, and that our gospel is the gospel of peace.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President congratulated Akanji on the occasion of his 60th birthday on Monday August 16.\n\nHe wished him more strength, wisdom and favour and asked for God\u2019s blessing on all Nigerians.",

          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nIndications have emerged that some leading figures of self-determination groups may have fled from the country following alleged plot by the Federal Government to clamp down on them ahead of the planned \u2018One Million March\u2019 slated for September 14 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, USA.\n\nSunday Sun reliably gathered during the week that self-determination groups in the country uncovered a surreptitious plan by the government to embark on massive arrests of key figures of the groups ahead of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA, which holds from September 14 to 21.\n\nA notable supporter of Oodua Nation who craved anonymity told Sunday Sun that the alleged move by the government was aimed at throwing spanner into the entire arrangements by self-determination groups to appear at the United Nations headquarters with a view to pressing home the groups\u2019 demand for a referendum to decide on the rights to self-determination of the people.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201dsince the secret plan by the government to arrest prominent supporters among the self-determination groups in order to bungle the groups\u2019 presentations at the United Nations was uncovered, leading figures that are key to the presentation have been leaving the country ahead of time,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nThe source also noted that the government was shocked to realise that the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and the attempt to get the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, out of circulation are yet to yield desired results of suppressing the clamour for self-determinations by the groups. So, their next plan is to embark on massive crackdown of other known figures within the groups.\n\n\u201cIt has now dawned on them that the proponents of Oodua Nation and Biafra really mean business because of the way these groups have carried on with their demand for freedom despite the clampdown on the leaders of the groups,\u201d the source said.\n\nReports had claimed that Ilana Omo Oodua would be making an official presentation at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA, on the need to convince the world organisation for a separate and independent Yoruba nation, a development, the source said, might have jolted the government into plotting to disorganize the groups\u2019 move at getting the much-sought international attention.\n\nBut a statement released by the Communication Manager of the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination, NINAS, the umbrella body of leading regional self-determination groups in the South and Middle Belt of Nigeria, Maxwell Adeleye, indicated that the group would not be making an official presentation at the United Nations General Assembly. Rather, it stated that NINAS was currently perfecting plan to stage a \u2018One Million March\u2019 during the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly billed for 14 to 21 September 14 to 21.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe wish to say very expressly that Ilana Omo Oodua, contrary to media reports, will not be making any official presentation at UNGA\n\n\u201cWhat will be happening at UNGA is that the members of Ilana Omo Oodua under the leadership of Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye alongside other members of NINAS from the Lower Niger and Middle Belt of Nigeria will be holding a \u2018One Million March\u2019 opposite the United Nations Headquarters in New York, United States from 14th to 21st September, 2021 to demand for a referendum to decide on the rights to self-determination of the people who want an end to unitary systems of Nigeria which has been turned into an apartheid state.\n\n\u201cWe shall also be demanding, first and foremost, for the abolition of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria which we have shown to be a fraud perpetrated against the people of the South and Middle Belt of Nigeria given that the people did not make it.\n\n\u201cAll the sons and daughters of the Southeast, South-south, Southwest and Middle Belt\u2019s clans, living in the United States of America, are being mobilised to stand up for their indigenous nationalities by participating in the one week \u2018one million march\u2019 for the liberation of their people.\n\n\u201cThe planned march shall be historic and epoch-making. We want the whole world to see the level of injustice, oppression and intimidation currently going on in Nigeria. The time is now.\u201d\n\nThe statement listed Prof Banji Akintoye, Prof Yusuf Turakithe Secretary-General of NINAS, Mr. Tony Nnadi; and National Chairman of Ilana Omo Oodua, Prof Wale Adeniran, among others as leaders of the \u2018one million march.\u2019",

          "text": "Afghanistan\u2019s embattled president, Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country on Sunday, has addressed the people of the Asian nation, stating the reasons why he left.\n\nGhani had joined his fellow citizens and foreigners in a stampede fleeing the advancing Taliban and signalling the end of a 20-year Western experiment aimed at remaking Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nHis exit was confirmed by Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council, in an online video on Sunday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe former president of Afghanistan left Afghanistan, leaving the country in this difficult situation. God should hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press news agency reports that Ghani flew out of the country. However, a report by Al Jazeera indicated that the President might have left for Tajikistan.\n\nBut in his statement addressed to the people of Afghanistan, Ghani said, \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\n\"Dear countrymen! Today, I came across a hard choice; I should stand to face the armed Taliban who wanted to enter the palace or leave the dear country that I dedicated my life to protecting and protecting the past twenty years. If there were still countless countrymen martyred and they would face the destruction and destruction of Kabul city, the result would have been a big human disaster in this six million city. The Taliban have made it to remove me, they are here to attack all Kabul and the people of Kabul. In order to avoid the bleeding flood, I thought it was best to get out.\n\n\"Taliban have won the judgement of sword and guns and now they are responsible for protecting the countrymen's honor, wealth and self-esteem. Didn't they win the legitimacy of hearts. Never in history has dry power given legitimacy to anyone and won't give it to them. They are now facing a new historical test; either they will protect the name and honor of Afghanistan or they will prioritize other places and networks.\n\n\"Many people and many Aqshar are in fear and are unreliable in the future. It is necessary for Taliban to assure all the people, nations, different sectors, sisters and women of Afghanistan to win the legitimacy and the hearts of the people.

His current location is unconfirmed.\n\nSenior Taliban commanders announced within the last two hours that they had taken control of the palace, according to news wire reports.

For me, I will say let\u2019s give it at least the last try. But just like in marriage, if people are trying to kill each other in a marriage, it is better for them to be separated for the sake of peace,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSo, if we are going to keep slaughtering each other, then it is better to separate every side and then on their own, the Middle Belt could decide that they want to partner with and join Yorubaland, or Oduduwa and Biafra to become another country. Let that be their free choice and referendum. This would be an option, instead of slaughtering each other.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the problems facing the northern part of the country, he noted that the \u201cpeculiar disease\u201d facing the north is perpetuated by elites who do not like the country.\n\nHe also accused the elites in the north of being silent on insecurity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have a peculiar disease in northern Nigeria perpetuated by elites. They are very bankrupt, they are very jaundiced, and they hate the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is what I\u2019m beginning to see, because with all these killings, they are not talking.

The request was considered an \u201coutrage \u00e0 magistrat\u201d (contempt of court) by the AG, who ordered her immediate arrest.\n\nHello All!\n\n\n\n1st, Congrats for amazing mobilization today.\n\n2nd, stay mobilized. @africatechie is still under arrest.

          "title": "Beyond funding, MAGIC Fund\u2019s value-add helps early-stage founders scale",
          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "The Week Ahead",
          "text": "Vehicle licences and number plates caught in inflation web\n\nVehicle registration in the coming weeks would be accompanied by a significant spike in prices. The Federal Government has started the implementation of newly increased rates for vehicle number plates and driving licences across the country.\n\nThe decision for the new rates was taken at the 147th meeting of the Joint Tax Board (JTB), which was held in Kaduna on March 25, 2021, where 50% and above rate increases were affected.\n\nRead also: FRSC denies reports of new number plates, driver\u2019s licence prices\n\nThe JTB in the new rates said that Nigerians will now pay N18,750 for standard private and commercial number plates against the old rate of N12,500, fancy number plate which was N80,000 will now cost N200,000, while motorcycle number plate which was N3,000, will now cost N5,000.\n\nOthers are, articulated number plates (three plates) will now attract N30,000, up from N20,000, out of series number plate has also been revised to N50,000 from N40,000 while government fancy number plate is N20,000 against the former N15,000 rate.\n\nJTB in its new rate said that driving licence (three years) was raised to N10,000 from N6,000, excluding bank charges; licence for five years is N15,000 from N10,000, motorcycle/tricycle driving licence (three years) goes for N5,000 from N3,000 while the one for five years attracts N8,000 from N5,000.\n\nEko bridge axis to witness the ease of traffic on 10-week rehabilitation completion\n\nThe Federal Government revealed the re-opening of the Eko bridge on Friday, August 13, after it was closed for 10 weeks due to rehabilitation.\n\nThe Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Olukayode Popoola, stated that traffic would also be diverted for the rehabilitation of the burnt Lagos Airport flyover from August 13.\n\nPopoola also said traffic diversion towards the rehabilitation of the burnt Airport flyover bridge in Lagos would begin from Friday, August 13 until September 22.\n\nThe FG added that any additional work on the bridge would not require it to be closed for repairs.\n\nHe added that additional works to be carried out on the Eko bridge would not require closure, while the traffic diversion for the rehabilitation of the Airport flyover bridge would last till September 22.\n\nNBS Economy data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\n\u00b7 Monday 16th August 2021: CPI and Inflation Report July 2021\n\n\u00b7 Tuesday 17th August 2021: Liquefied Petroleum Gas (COOKING GAS) Price Watch July 2021 & National Household Kerosene Price Watch July 2021\n\n\u00b7 Wednesday 18th August 2021: Pension Asset and Membership Data (Q2 2021) & Premium Motor Spirit (PETROL) Price Watch July 2021.\n\n\u00b7 Thursday 19th August 2021: Automotive Gas oil (DIESEL) Price Watch July 2021, Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) July 2021 Disbursement & Selected Food Prices July 2021.\n\nGold suffers worst week in 2 months\n\nGold had its worst week in 7 weeks as the market closed bearish on Friday by 2.73%, crumbling below the $1,800 trading zone. The decline in the yellow metal came as a result of the dollar being bullish on the back of the U.S Non-farm payroll (NFP) report which reported the U.S. jobs and raised questions about the continuance of stimulus provided by the Fed to markets and the economy.\n\nSellers dominated the Gold market last week as bears gained more pressure on the back of the NFP report released by the U.S. The report gave strength to the U.S dollar index and this ultimately caused the sell-off in the price of Gold.\n\nGold traded as low as $1,759.50 on Friday but the yellow metal recovered some parts of its loss by closing the week at $1,763.10 down 2.53% for the day. Friday also represented the biggest loss the yellow metal had gotten in about 44 days when the market crashed by 4.65%. Gold appreciated by 1.05% while Silver dipped by -1.94% W-o-W.\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, as Federal Reserve\u2019s taper talk ebbs.\n\nOil Prices\n\nOil prices fell by nearly 2%, on Monday, on the back of a rising U.S. dollar and concerns that new pandemic curbs in Asia, especially China, may dampen the prospect of global recovery in fuel demand.\n\nJuly fuel demand in India rebounded to its highest since April as New Delhi cleared restrictions and lockdowns, netting a 3% month-on-month increase to a total of 16.83 million tons.\n\nU.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs lowered its oil demand forecast for China for the next two months, citing rising concerns over the impact of the next wave of COVID-19 infections.\n\nOfficers at some refineries in Asia have stated that Asian refiners demanded lower than usual volumes of crude oil from Saudi Arabia in September as authorities in China and the rest of Asia have re-imposed restrictions to fight the Delta variant surge.\n\nOPEC on Thursday maintained its prediction of a strong recovery in world oil demand in 2021 and further growth in 2022, despite concerns about the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant that has weighed on prices. However, the Commission raised its forecast for non-OPEC members.\n\nOil prices fell on Friday for a second day after the International Energy Agency warned that demand growth for crude and its products had slowed sharply as surging COVID-19 cases worldwide forced governments to revive movement restrictions. Brent had a weekly growth of 0.04%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to hold steady as concerns about the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant is set to weigh on prices.\n\nCurrency Market\n\nThe Naira was bearish at the end of the week, at the BDC market, and marginally at the NAFEX window, majorly attributed to the scarcity of FX.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the domestic currency appreciated by -0.17% on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis to close at N410.80/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.\n\nAgainst the US dollar at the BDC it closed at US$1/N513 depreciating by +0.98%, against the British pound it also appreciated by -0.71% to close at \u00a31/N700, and against the Euro by -0.33% to close at \u20ac1/N600.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N410.80 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.13.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney Market\n\nInterbank rates were elevated last week, as liquidity levels remained depressed causing rates to move in double digits.\n\nAt the close of the session on Friday, funding rates dipped significantly. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 16.75% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 17.25% indicating a W-o-W rise of -16.25% for OBB and -15.85% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury Bills Market\n\nThe bills market continued its bullish trend across the board last week, as we saw some buying on all tenors through the week.\n\nAt the close of the market last week, average benchmark yields for T-bills fell by -17.05% to 4.67%, OMO bills declined up by -1.62% W-o-W to close at 7.65%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell significantly by 31.14% to close at 5.66%.\n\nThe CBN sold N156.31 billion worth of notes against N51.48 billion offered at its NTB auction last week. The 91-day, 182-day & 364-day notes were allotted at 2.50%, 3.50%, and 7.35% respectively. Compared to the previous auction, rates on the 91-day & 182-day were unchanged while the 364-day paper fell by 85bps.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and Eurobond\n\nThe bulls continued their dominance in the FGN bond market last week as positive sentiment was seen across the board.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 8.57% for the week which fell W-o-W by -5.40%.\n\nPerformance in the Eurobond market was mixed last week, with most of the buying concentrated at the short end of the curve. Average benchmark yields rose W-o-W by +1.14% to 5.88% on Friday.\n\nWe expect the relatively quiet trend to persist in the near term.\n\nThe Nigerian Capital Market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a positive note with some cherry-picking and bargain hunting in stocks like AIRTELAFRI. The NGXASI closed the week with a growth of +1.83%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange gained N370.75bn, year-to-date return moderated to -1.86%, while the market capitalisation settled at N20.59 trillion.\n\nThe volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange last week dipped by -66.88% and -40.98% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was mixed last week as the NGX Banking was the highest gainer for the week with +0.49% while NGX Oil & Gas and NGX Consumer Goods closed positive with +0.43 and +0.30% while NGX Insurance and NGX-IND declined by -2.37% and -1.37% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed flat with 29 gainers led by HONYFLOUR and NNFM as against 29 losers led by JULI and REGALINS.\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the market to remain relatively bullish, although with some slight profit taking and bargain hunting as the half-year earnings season fades off. However, other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.",

          "title": "2023: Who will rebuild Nigeria?",
          "text": "The popular question on the lips of many citizens nowadays is, \u201cwho will rebuild Nigeria?\u201d\n\nThe question became necessary when viewed from the current situation of the country and its abysmal rating in all departments of life.\n\nObservers converge on the belief that Nigeria has been wrecked, needing urgent total re-engineering. Nigeria today has become a laughing stock in the comity of nations, even on the African continent where it claims to be the giant.\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, while addressing journalists Wednesday on the need for total overhaul of Nigeria, said the country has been totally destroyed and has descended into a level never experienced in her history.\n\nNigeria seems to be in a more precarious situation now than in 2015 when a coalition of opposition parties, some prominent Nigerians and even some caucus in the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), the ruling party then, joined forces with others to push out of power the then president Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nFor many then, it was \u2018anybody but Jonathan\u2019. Today, they all are regretting as the acclaimed \u2018messiah\u2019 seems to be sleeping while the country keeps drifting apart from insecurity, growing poverty, economic meltdown, more corruption, nepotism, favouritism, among other ills.\n\nA senior lecturer with a federal university, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that even some of those who shouted \u201chosanna\u201d then, are singing a different tune.\n\n\u201cThings are getting out of hand in the country. We can see it; we can smell it. Even an unborn baby can sense that all is not well with Nigeria. Many of those who kicked out Jonathan have even openly confessed and begged him to forgive them. We all heard what Tunde Bakare said the other day about a government he helped to install. It has never been bad. So, Nigerians must \u2018shine their eyes\u2019 in 2023. Once bitten twice shy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terrible situation of the country was probably the reason Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB), a former military head of state, made recommendations for the choice of presidential candidates come 2023.\n\nBabangida had at a recent interview with Arise Television in his home in Minna, prescribed the quality of candidates Nigerians should be looking at.\n\nIBB\u2019s recommendation has been trending in the traditional and social media platforms across the country.\n\nAs expected, many Nigerians are already talking and some are tackling him from different corners.\n\nMost people, who used to be supporters of IBB are angry that their once famed hero, is talking when he should cover his face in shame for destroying democracy in Nigeria with the annulment of June 12 election, where Moshood Abiola, won convincingly.\n\n\u201cI think IBB has murdered democracy and should not come close to it again, even making suggestions,\u201d Thomas Enenche, an Abuja-based lawyer and human right activist, said.\n\nRead Also: IBB: Corruption worse under civilian leaders than military rulers\n\nEnenche, who was once a fan of IBB, decried that the so-called \u2018IBB Boys\u2019 are still in power and carrying on with the squandering culture of their mentor.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, IBB is still a political godfather, even though he should be in jail for annulling June 12 election and for not accounting for the crude oil windfall during his regime, those he mentored are part of the people running the country down. You cannot give what you don\u2019t have, IBB disrupted nascent democracy in the country and should not be listened to,\u201d Enenche said.\n\nPutting things in the right perspective, some keen observers of Nigerian politics, who have also blamed the poor governance and retarded development in the country since return to democracy in 1999 on the bad influence of military in the Nigerian affairs, think that the military has not left politics as retired Army generals are taking turn to become civilian president of the country, hence, any recommendation from one of them should be jettisoned.\n\nObafemi Oluwole, a university don and founder, African Diversity Group, a pan-African development policy, strategy and governance platform, thinks that IBB should be resting in his retirement and should made recommendations to his \u2018boys\u2019 who are desperate for power like him, to give priority to the interest and prosperity of the country than the amassing of Nigeria\u2019s wealth and rubbing it on the faces of the poor masses.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria is a developed country, the likes of IBB would have served many years in jail for their actions against democratic and economic development of the country. The annulment of June 12 set the country back and we are feeling the impact till date. If IBB had respected the wishes of Nigerians then, our democracy would have grown better and there would be no need to recycle retired army generals to rule us for lack of credible candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nThe associate professor of Political Science warned the political class to allow the masses to decide who would rule them, no matter the party, tribe, religion or geopolitical zone.\n\nHis suggestions above, according to him, should have been what IBB should recommend, but that IBB cannot make such suggestions because he has no moral standing to talk in the Nigerian democracy which he dealt the heaviest blow on.\n\nEbelem Kalunta, a former lawmaker in the Abia State House of Assembly, decried that IBB enshrined what he called \u2018chop I chop system, where sharing of the national wealth is the common interest of office holders; whether political, public or private.\n\n\u201cThis has been the bane of corruption in the country, which President Buhari is fighting lopsidedly today. Imagine a corrupt politician moving from PDP to APC and the court will acquit him of corruption charges. There is no difference in the military generals\u2019 approach to leadership.\n\n\u201cSo, not just IBB, Obasanjo, and Buhari, every other serving or retired military general should not think of politics, they should make suggestions on how to address insecurity in the country, which is their primary assignment and not politics this time. Let them stay in the barracks even in their retirement, we don\u2019t need them,\u201d Kalunta said.\n\nKalunta also thinks that the choice of the next Nigerian president will be better decided by the masses, and that the process should have started from the time the present administration gave up on terrorists and bandits, but that the opposition has continually lacked the strength to push the ruling party to make good decisions.\n\n\u201cIf PDP and other opposition parties are doing half of what APC did before 2015, the government would not have forced so many bad policies and inhuman actions on Nigerians. Instead of IBB, let the masses make recommendations and insist on them, let the opposition field better candidates and tackle the government as they should and we will have a good leader come 2023,\u201d the former lawmaker concluded.\n\nWith less than two years to the 2023 presidential election, political activities appear to be picking up with realignment and re-realignment of forces.\n\nIn the last few months, some leading politicians have declared their interest in the presidential race in Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, the first was former, Zamfara State governor, Sanni Yerima, Kingsley Moghalu, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Sam Ohuabunwa, president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN).\n\nSeveral other prominent politicians including Peter Obi and Rochas Okorocha, former governors of Anambra and Imo states, respectively, and Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State are also touted to be interested in contesting for the presidency in 2023.\n\nSome other individuals have also been suggested as good materials for the job. They include, Olisa Agbakoba, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN); Kayode Fayemi, current governor of Ekiti State; Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of Lagos State and current of Works, among others\n\nIn the last few months, there has also been some scheming among regional leaders to have the presidency zoned to their region. It is also important to note that some Nigerians simply do not care which region the president comes from in 2023, their main concern is a leader who is detribalised and represents the general interest of Nigerians.\n\nBuhari was re-elected in 2019, but there is the feeling among many Nigerians that the President has largely failed in the last six years in power.\n\nHis inability to fulfil his campaign promises; part of which was to fight graft, revamp the economy and tackle insecurity have led to general feeling of disenchantment among Nigerians.\n\nObservers say that the President\u2019s penchant for appointing mostly Northerners into public positions which has become controversial in recent times has further dented his administration\u2019s popularity.\n\nAnd amid the spate of insecurity, bad state of the economy and worsening standard of living among Nigerians, which has resulted in the country overtaking India as the country with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty.\n\nMeanwhile, in view of the state of affairs, there is growing concern among stakeholders that there should be increased scrutiny of the qualities Nigerians should look-out for in their future president and where his immediate focus should be when elected into office.\n\nPerhaps, Babangida\u2019s recommendations opened the floor for debate last week when he prescribed that the next Nigeria\u2019s President should be in his 60\u2019s.\n\nHe said such individuals should also have sound knowledge of the economy with contacts across the nation and who had been traversing the geo-political zones marketing their acceptability and capacity.\n\n\u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in their 60\u2019s,\u201d Babangida had said.\n\nIn the last one week there have been mixed reactions across Nigeria on the former military ruler\u2019s comments and what should form the yardstick for anyone to emerge Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nWhile some agree with Babangida\u2019s view others simply disagreed, while others criticised his sense of judgment.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with BusinessDay, Ayo Adebanjo, leader of pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, disagreed with Babangida, saying that Nigeria\u2019s next president should be decided based on competence rather than age.\n\nAdebanjo suggested that age could not be used to determine who can effectively rule the country, citing examples from western countries.\n\nThe Afenifere leader stressed that the younger population had not even proven that they had learned from the older ones in terms of governance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with this; that is not the situation in developing countries. Age should not be the basis for determining who rules Nigeria, I don\u2019t believe in age. Any competent individual can rule; even the young ones appear not to have learned their lesson.\n\n\u201cBabangida should stop feeding us with that nonsense, he should shut up; if we have a proper system such people should be under trial by now\u201d.\n\nPolitical Analyst, Kunle Okunade said the intending president should have a clear understanding of the economy, respect the rule of law and be a nationalist who can unite the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHe must have a clear understanding of how to revive Nigeria\u2019s economy. He must have a record of respecting the rule of law. He must have nationalistic tendencies in his thinking and communication.\n\n\u201cHe must not be up to 70years old and be able to connect and communicate with the youths. He must be an exposed individual who has friends and associates across the globe. He must understand how to manage the diversity of the country and reposition the country for greatness\u201d.\n\nFormer youth leader of the defunct Kowa Party, Mavis Abhulimen, urged Nigerians to be careful in deciding who governs the country from 2023, adding that such individual\u2019s leadership experience and antecedent was crucial.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigerians have to choose wisely. The kind of president I would want in 2023 is a person with a dynamic personality. A candidate not tainted by our past history; one who has credibility in his antecedents.\n\n\u201cA candidate that is in touch with the realities of today\u2019s Nigeria. A man or woman who has been successful in managing businesses or enterprises or institutions with excellence that no one can argue about. I believe that a president that will make the difference should be within the age bracket of 50 and 65\u201d.\n\nNigeria is in dire need of a deliverer. Recently, Professor Attahiru Jega, a former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), openly castigated the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), urging Nigerians to reject the two political parties in 2023.\n\nBut the challenge is getting the Third Force in a country where politicians are not ready to give established parties a fight.\n\nFor instance, before 2019 general election, many real and quasi-politicians bandied the Third Force concept, but they all chickened out.\n\nThey complained that the two major parties were too big to wrestle down. All of a sudden, the proponents of the 3rd force emptied themselves into the ruling party.",

          "text": "Afghanistan\u2019s president, Ashraf Ghani, has reportedly fled the country as the Taliban takes the country\u2019s capital, Kabul.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Tolo News reported Sunday that Ghani left the country, a report that has been confirmed by Al-Jazeera.\n\nThe Afghan president\u2019s office, however, told Reuters that they \u201ccannot say anything about Ashraf Ghani\u2019s movement[s] for security reasons\u201d.\n\nTaliban insurgents had entered the Afghanistan capital Kabul on Sunday, an interior ministry official confirmed, as the United States evacuated diplomats from its embassy by helicopter.\n\nThe senior official told Reuters the Taliban were coming in \u201cfrom all sides\u201d but gave no further details.\n\nA tweet from the Afghan Presidential palace account said firing had been heard at a number of points around Kabul but that security forces, in coordination with international partners, had control of the city.\n\nU.S. officials said the diplomats were being ferried to the airport from the embassy in the fortified Wazir Akbar Khan district. More American troops were being sent to help in the evacuations after the Taliban\u2019s lightning advances brought the Islamist group to Kabul in a matter of days.\n\nJust last week, a U.S. intelligence estimate said Kabul could hold out for at least three months.\n\n\u201cCore\u201d U.S. team members were working from the Kabul airport, a U.S. official said, while a NATO official said several EU staff had moved to a safer, undisclosed location in the capital.\n\nA Taliban official told Reuters the group did not want any casualties as it took charge but had not declared a ceasefire.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the insurgents captured the eastern city of Jalalabad without a fight, giving them control of one of the main highways into landlocked Afghanistan. They also took over the nearby Torkham border post with Pakistan, leaving Kabul airport the only way out of Afghanistan that is still in government hands.\n\nThe capture of Jalalabad followed the Taliban\u2019s seizure of the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif late on Saturday, also with little fighting.\n\n\u201cThere are no clashes taking place right now in Jalalabad because the governor has surrendered to the Taliban,\u201d a Jalalabad-based Afghan official told Reuters. \u201cAllowing passage to the Taliban was the only way to save civilian lives.\u201d\n\nA video clip distributed by the Taliban showed people cheering and shout Allahu Akbar \u2013 God is greatest \u2013 as a convoy of pick-up trucks entered the city with fighters brandishing machine guns and the white Taliban flag.\n\nAfter U.S.-led forces withdrew the bulk of the their remaining troops in the last month, the Taliban campaign accelerated as the Afghan military\u2019s defences appeared to collapse.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Saturday authorised the deployment of 5,000 U.S. troops to help evacuate citizens and ensure an \u201corderly and safe\u201d drawdown of military personnel. A U.S. defence official said that included 1,000 newly approved troops from the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nTaliban fighters entered Mazar-i-Sharif virtually unopposed as security forces escaped up the highway to Uzbekistan, about 80 km (50 miles) to the north, provincial officials said. Unverified video on social media showed Afghan army vehicles and men in uniforms crowding the iron bridge between the Afghan town of Hairatan and Uzbekistan.\n\nTwo influential militia leaders supporting the government \u2013 Atta Mohammad Noor and Abdul Rashid Dostum \u2013 also fled. Noor said on social media that the Taliban had been handed control of Balkh province, where Mazar-i-Sharif is located, due to a \u201cconspiracy.\u201d read more\n\nPOPULARLY ACCEPTED\n\nIn a statement late on Saturday, the Taliban said its rapid gains showed it was popularly accepted by the Afghan people and reassured both Afghans and foreigners that they would be safe, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Islamic Emirate, as the Taliban calls itself, \u201cwill, as always, protect their life, property and honour, and create a peaceful and secure environment for its beloved nation,\u201d it said, adding that diplomats and aid workers would also face no problems.\n\nAfghans have fled the provinces to enter Kabul in recent days, fearing a return to hardline Islamist rule.\n\nEarly on Sunday, refugees from Taliban-controlled provinces were seen unloading belongings from taxis and families stood outside embassy gates, while the city\u2019s downtown was packed with people stocking up on supplies.\n\nHundreds of people slept huddled in tents or in the open in the city, by roadsides or in car parks, a resident said on Saturday night. \u201cYou can see the fear in their faces,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden said his administration had told Taliban officials in talks in Qatar that any action that put U.S. personnel at risk \u201cwill be met with a swift and strong U.S. military response.\u201d\n\nHe has faced rising domestic criticism as the Taliban have taken city after city far more quickly than predicted. The president has stuck to a plan, initiated by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, to end the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan by Aug. 31.\n\nBiden said it is up to the Afghan military to hold its own territory. \u201cAn endless American presence in the middle of another country\u2019s civil conflict was not acceptable to me,\u201d Biden said on Saturday.\n\nQatar, which has been hosting so-far inconclusive peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, said it had urged the insurgents to cease fire. Ghani has given no sign of responding to a Taliban demand that he resign as a condition for any ceasefire.\n\nEstonia and Norway have requested the 15-member United Nations security council meet on Afghanistan as soon as possible, diplomats said on Sunday.\n\nThe Russian state news agency reports that the Taliban promised to guarantee the safety of the Russian embassy in Kabul.\n\nSpain\u2019s defence ministry says it has not yet begun evacuating Spanish nationals and Afghan staff including translators who are expected to be flown out alongside its citizens, but it is speeding up its plans.\n\nGermany is sending military transport planes to Kabul to begin the evacuation of its embassy staff on Monday.\n\nThe Dutch embassy in Kabul has moved to a new location near the airport which is located 6km north-east of the city centre.",

          "text": "Few hours after announcing a dusk-to-dawn curfew in three local government areas of Jos North, Jos South and Bassa, Plateau State governor, Simon Bako Lalong has directed the imposition of a 24-hour curfew in Jos North to contain further security threats.\n\nThis comes after travellers were yesterday ambushed and about 23 killed by suspected Irigwe youth in apparent retaliatory attack.\n\nThe victims were said to be Sufi Muslims who attended a religious gathering for Muslim new year in Bauchi and were on their way back to the South where they reside.\n\nMany were said to have been based in Ondo State, Southwest Nigeria. The state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, had yesterday, condemned the attack in a statement.\n\nThe killing follows months of repeated clashes between rigwe youth and Fulani herders who had reportedly sustained attacks in the area for periods.\n\nIn the past two days, the Irigwe youth had repeatedly announced that they were conveying the corpses of their kin slain by suspected herders for burial in Bassa on Saturday.\n\nReports said they had set out in a convoy for the burial on Saturday morning when violence broke out along the way at Rukuba road.\n\nAs they went with the corpses, they met some vans conveying some Muslims identified as Fulani along their way. The Fulani reportedly claimed they were commuters from Bauchi, but the angry youth challenged them seeing that Rukuba road does not connect Bauchi highway. They suspected that they may have come to attack them at the burial ground.\n\nThe irate youth were said to have dragged their victims out of their vehicles which were trapped in gridlock around Rukuba Road in Jos and started killing them using machetes, daggers, knives, stones and other dangerous weapons.\n\nThough the violence has been quelled by Soldiers drafted from the Special Task Force (STF) on security, and at least 20 people have been arrested, the city is still enveloped in palpable tension.\n\nGovernor Lalong\u2019s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Macham Makut announced the curfew in a statement in Jos on Sunday\n\nThe statement quoted the Governor as saying \u201cfrom 2pm of today, Sunday 15th August 2021, a 24-hour curfew will come into effect in Jos North Local Government Area. This is necessitated by security reports which indicate rising threats to the safety of lives and properties within the Local Government\u201d.\n\nThe Governor urged citizens to abide by the curfew and remain indoors to allow security agencies maintain law and order and deal with those bent on causing chaos.\n\nThe Governor said that the 24 hour curfew in Jos North Local Government will remain in force until further notice adding\n\n\u201cAgain, citizens are to note that the 24 hour curfew in Jos North will take effect from 2pm today 15th August 202.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, police in a statement on Sunday, said 20 people have been arrested in connection with the incident, while another 33 people have been rescued.\n\nThis is as the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba, on Sunday ordered the immediate deployment of Police Intervention Team to Plateau State to carry out an on-the-spot assessment.\n\nThe team, which comprises personnel of Police Tactical Units \u2013 the Police Mobile Force (PMF), Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), Police Special Forces, amongst others, is being led by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of Finance and Administration, Sanusi Lemu.\n\nAlso deployed are investigators and covert operatives from the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) and the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB), who are expected to provide additional investigative, intelligence and forensic support to the Plateau State Police Command in the ongoing investigations and rescue operations.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Force spokesman, Frank MBA, the squads are to ensure enhanced, coordinated response to protect the community and boost public confidence in the affected area(s) of the State in order to prevent further attacks as well as bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nThe police chief enjoined citizens in the affected area(s) to support the security forces deployed to the hotspot by providing useful information that will lead to the arrest of other perpetrators of the crime and forestall any further attack.\n\nThe statement added, \u201dThe IGP, while condemning the incident, has called for calm and assured victims and relatives of the attack that the Police are working with the military, other security forces and the State Government to ensure that all perpetrators of the unfortunate incident are brought to book\n\nEarlier In a statement on Saturday, the Plateau State Police Command blamed Irigwe youth for killing, noting that suspects have been arrested for\n\n\u201cOn 14/08/2021 at about 0928hrs, the Plateau State Police Command received a distress call that a group of attackers suspected to be Irigwe youths and their sympathisers along Rukuba Road of Jos North LGA attacked a convoy of five buses with Muslim faithful who were coming back from the Annual Zikr prayer in Bauchi State and are heading to Ikare in Ondo State,\u201d the police had said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, twenty-two (22) persons were killed and Fourteen injured in the attack.\n\n\u201cUpon receipt of the report, a team of Police personnel, the military and other sister agencies were immediately mobilised to the scene where twenty one (21) victims were rescued and six suspects arrested.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command, CP Edward Egbuka along with the GOC 3-Division, Major General Ibrahim Ali, also visited the scene and ordered for a discreet investigation to fish out other perpetrators of this barbaric act at large.\n\n\u201cThe Cp warned that those that perpetrated this dastardly act & others that incited it, will be made to face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Command urges the public to remain calm and to furnish the Police with useful information that will aid the investigation.\u201d\n\nLalong had on Saturday condemned the killings and directed security agencies to swiftly identify and arrest the perpetrators while dominating the area to restore calm.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Director of Press, Macham read in part: \u201cGovernor Simon Bako Lalong has warned trouble makers bent on fomenting trouble in Plateau State to desist as the government will not allow any form of lawlessness to disrupt the peace of the State.\n\n\u201cLalong said the attacks on innocent citizens no matter their backgrounds will never be tolerated in Plateau State and those who are found to be behind such attacks will be dealt with decisively to serve as deterrence and restore public order.\n\n\u201cThe Governor however commends security agencies for their immediate response leading to the arrest of some suspects and the restoration of calm to the area.\u201d\n\nThe Governor also commiserated with the families of those affected, and assured all law abiding citizens that security had been beefed up around the area as well as the entire metropolis to forestall further breach of the peace.\n\nHe reminded the citizens to remain vigilant and be security conscious in reporting suspicious persons and behaviour within their domains to enable law enforcement agencies to respond appropriately.\n\nLalong also directed the Secretary to the Government of the State, Prof. Danladi Atu to visit the areas and ascertain the situation as well as ensure that those injured received adequate medical attention.\n\nThe peace of the state has been troubled by series of skirmishes in recent times, leading to several deaths and destruction of properties, especially in Bassa and Riyom Local Government Areas. The Governor has repeatedly warned that violent merchants won\u2019t be allowed to have their way in the state.",

          "title": "Afghan President Flees As Taliban Surrounds Kabul",
          "text": "Afghanistan\u2019s embattled president has left the country, joining his fellow citizens and foreigners in a stampede fleeing the advancing Taliban and signalling the end of a 20-year Western experiment aimed at remaking Afghanistan.\n\nThe head of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council, Abdullah Abdullah, confirmed in an online video that President Ashraf Ghani had left, yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe former president of Afghanistan left Afghanistan, leaving the country in this difficult situation,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cGod should hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nGhani flew out of the country, two officials told The Associated Press news agency, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief journalists. Local media reported that Ghani left for Tajikistan.\n\nAbdullah said he wants security forces to continue providing security for Kabul and asked the Taliban to wait for talks before entering the city.\n\nBut the Taliban, which for hours had been on the outskirts of Kabul, announced soon after that they would move further into a city gripped by panic throughout the day as helicopters raced overhead to evacuate personnel from the US embassy. Smoke rose near the compound as staff destroyed important documents. Several other Western missions also prepared to pull their people out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCivilians, fearing that the Taliban could reimpose the kind of brutal rule that all but eliminated women\u2019s rights, rushed to leave the country as well, lining up at cash machines to withdraw their life savings. The desperately poor \u2013 who had left homes in the countryside for the hoped-for safety in the capital \u2013 remained in their thousands in parks and open spaces throughout the city.\n\nIn a stunning rout, the Taliban has captured 26 of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provincial capitals since August 6, despite the billions of dollars spent by the US and NATO over nearly 20 years to build up Afghan security forces.\n\nJust days earlier, an American military assessment estimated it would be a month before the capital would come under the Taliban pressure.\n\nInstead, the Taliban swiftly defeated, co-opted or sent Afghan security forces fleeing from wide swaths of the country, even though they had some air support from the US military.\n\nOn Sunday, the Taliban reached the outskirts of Kabul but apparently remained outside the city\u2019s downtown. Sporadic gunfire echoed at times though the streets were largely quiet.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Rob McBride, reporting from Kabul, said it was a day of \u201cincredible developments\u201d, as Ghani was expected to be involved in negotiations over a power transfer.\n\n\u201cI think everyone accepted it would be some sort of deal that would not involve Ashraf Ghani himself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone anticipated that he would have left the country so quickly.\u201d\n\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Al Jazeera that the group is \u201cawaiting a peaceful transfer of Kabul city\u201d. He declined to offer specifics on any possible negotiations between his forces and the government.\n\nBut when pressed on what kind of agreement the Taliban wanted, Shaheen acknowledged that they were seeking an unconditional surrender by the central government.\n\nMcBride said it was generally accepted that the Taliban would have to include some elements of the previous administration in any agreement in order to gain any kind of legitimacy and be accepted by the wider international community.\n\n\u201cIn a cosmopolitan city like this there are many people who do not want a return of the old style of Taliban government,\u201d he said.\n\nTaliban negotiators were in Kabul yesterday to discuss the transfer of power, an Afghan official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals told the AP. It remained unclear when that transfer would take place and who among the Taliban was negotiating.\n\nThe negotiators on the government side included former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah. Abdullah has been a vocal critic of Ghani, who had served as Afghanistan\u2019s president since 2014 and long refused to give up power to get a deal with the Taliban.\n\nGhani appeared increasingly isolated before fleeing the country.

          "text": "Afghanistan\u2019s embattled president has left the country, joining his fellow citizens and foreigners in a stampede fleeing the advancing Taliban and signalling the end of a 20-year Western experiment aimed at remaking Afghanistan.\n\nThe head of the Afghan National Reconciliation Council, Abdullah Abdullah, confirmed in an online video that President Ashraf Ghani had left, yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe former president of Afghanistan left Afghanistan, leaving the country in this difficult situation,\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cGod should hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nGhani flew out of the country, two officials told The Associated Press news agency, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief journalists. Local media reported that Ghani left for Tajikistan.\n\nAbdullah said he wants security forces to continue providing security for Kabul and asked the Taliban to wait for talks before entering the city.\n\nBut the Taliban, which for hours had been on the outskirts of Kabul, announced soon after that they would move further into a city gripped by panic throughout the day as helicopters raced overhead to evacuate personnel from the US embassy. Smoke rose near the compound as staff destroyed important documents. Several other Western missions also prepared to pull their people out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCivilians, fearing that the Taliban could reimpose the kind of brutal rule that all but eliminated women\u2019s rights, rushed to leave the country as well, lining up at cash machines to withdraw their life savings. The desperately poor \u2013 who had left homes in the countryside for the hoped-for safety in the capital \u2013 remained in their thousands in parks and open spaces throughout the city.\n\nIn a stunning rout, the Taliban has captured 26 of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provincial capitals since August 6, despite the billions of dollars spent by the US and NATO over nearly 20 years to build up Afghan security forces.\n\nJust days earlier, an American military assessment estimated it would be a month before the capital would come under the Taliban pressure.\n\nInstead, the Taliban swiftly defeated, co-opted or sent Afghan security forces fleeing from wide swaths of the country, even though they had some air support from the US military.\n\nOn Sunday, the Taliban reached the outskirts of Kabul but apparently remained outside the city\u2019s downtown. Sporadic gunfire echoed at times though the streets were largely quiet.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Rob McBride, reporting from Kabul, said it was a day of \u201cincredible developments\u201d, as Ghani was expected to be involved in negotiations over a power transfer.\n\n\u201cI think everyone accepted it would be some sort of deal that would not involve Ashraf Ghani himself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone anticipated that he would have left the country so quickly.\u201d\n\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Al Jazeera that the group is \u201cawaiting a peaceful transfer of Kabul city\u201d. He declined to offer specifics on any possible negotiations between his forces and the government.\n\nBut when pressed on what kind of agreement the Taliban wanted, Shaheen acknowledged that they were seeking an unconditional surrender by the central government.\n\nMcBride said it was generally accepted that the Taliban would have to include some elements of the previous administration in any agreement in order to gain any kind of legitimacy and be accepted by the wider international community.\n\n\u201cIn a cosmopolitan city like this there are many people who do not want a return of the old style of Taliban government,\u201d he said.\n\nTaliban negotiators were in Kabul yesterday to discuss the transfer of power, an Afghan official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals told the AP. It remained unclear when that transfer would take place and who among the Taliban was negotiating.\n\nThe negotiators on the government side included former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah. Abdullah has been a vocal critic of Ghani, who had served as Afghanistan\u2019s president since 2014 and long refused to give up power to get a deal with the Taliban.\n\nGhani appeared increasingly isolated before fleeing the country. The strongmen he negotiated with just days earlier have surrendered to the Taliban or fled, leaving him without a military option. Negotiations in Doha, the capital of Qatar \u2013 the site of a Taliban office \u2013 have failed to stop the group\u2019s advance.\n\nActing defence minister Bismillah Khan sought to reassure the public that Kabul would remain \u201csecure\u201d.\n\nThe Taliban also tried to calm residents of the capital. \u201cNo one\u2019s life, property and dignity will be harmed and the lives of the citizens of Kabul will not be at risk,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nThey also said they would offer an \u201camnesty\u201d to those who worked with the Afghan government or foreign forces.\n\nBut there have been reports of revenge killings and other brutal tactics in areas of the country the Taliban has seized in recent days.\n\nAfghan officials said the Taliban also took the capitals of Maidan Wardak, Khost, Kapisa and Parwan provinces, yesterday.

          "text": "Nigerian billionaire, Femi Otedola has let out a deep secret of what former Military President, Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida (IBB) asked him to tell ex-President Goodluck Jonathan when his former boss, Umaru Yar\u2019Ardua was sick.\n\nAccording to Otedola, IBB asked him to tell Jonathan to sit on the empty seat of Yar\u2019Adua in the next Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, as a result of the logjam caused by the former president\u2019s absence when he was sick.\n\nThe billionaire, who released the details in his forthcoming book on business lessons, sent greetings to IBB as he clocks 80 years on Tuesday.\n\nIn the book obtained by Channels TV, Otedola said he was worried by the tension and uncertainty then when Yar\u2019Adua was sick, and that he decided to do something on his own.\n\nAccording to him, in the first week of February 2010, he went to Minna, Niger State, along with Hajia Bola Shagaya, to commiserate with Babangida over the death of his wife, Maryam.\n\nHe said at his Hilltop residence, they spoke on a wide range of issues, but that he told him he needed to discuss an urgent and vital issue with him.\n\nOtedola disclosed that Babangida took him to his study, where the two of them were alone, saying that he told him that the state of the nation had been agitating his mind.\n\nHe said he asked Babangida how the country could get out of the political logjam, emphasising that the political heat at the time was \u201ctoo much\u201d.\n\nOtedola added that IBB replied: \u201cFemi, advise your friend that when he gets to the Council Chambers next week for the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, he should go and sit on the President\u2019s chair.\u201d\n\nHe said he found what IBB told him fascinating and assured him that he would pass the message across, adding that he travelled back to Abuja by road in the evening and went straight to have dinner with Jonathan and did not waste time in delivering Babangida\u2019s message to him.\n\nAccording to Otedola, Jonathan nodded and asked him what he thought about IBB\u2019s suggestion.\n\nHe said he laughed and told him, \u201cBe a man, Your Excellency. Go and sit on that chair! He looked at me for some time and responded that he would think about it.\n\n\u201cA week later, on Tuesday, February 9, the National Assembly adopted the famous \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019 to make Dr Jonathan the Acting President pending the return of President Yar\u2019Adua from his medical leave. Behind-the-scene moves by prominent Nigerians preceded this decision.\n\n\u201cThe legislative resolution was unprecedented, but the nation had been tensed up.

          "title": "2023: I didn\u2019t rule out Atiku, Tinubu \u2013 IBB",
          "text": "Former Military President General Ibrahim Badamasi Babaginda (retd) has said he didn\u2019t rule out National Leader All Progressives Congress (APC) Ahmed Tinubu and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar from the 2023 presidential race.\n\nHe, however, insisted a Nigerian around 60-year-old age bracket and with requisite experience remains Nigeria\u2019s best choice as president in the 2023 general elections.\n\nBoth Atiku and Tinubu are in their late seventies and sixties respectively, and the duo are believed to be eyeing the nation\u2019s number one seat in 2023.\n\nIn a recent interview with ARISE Television, Gen. Babangida was quoted to have said: \u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties.\u201d\n\nBut providing further insight into his position Sunday in an exclusive interview with Blueprint in Minna, Niger state, the retired general said he never mentioned names nor ruled out anybody as being reported by some sections of the media (Blueprint not inclusive).\n\nHe spoke to this medium ahead of his 80th birthday which comes up Tuesday (tomorrow).\n\nAsked if the latest call for a 60-year-old to be Nigeria\u2019s president didn\u2019t negate his administration\u2019s policy which encouraged the new breed to be actively involved in politics, he said those new breed of that time are now well over 60 years of age.\n\nThe former Nigerian leader said such Nigerian must have been a public servant, private entrepreneur or professional who must have acquired some level of experience over a period of time.\n\nBabangida said: \u201cYou the media misquoted me to say that I said Atiku and Tinubu should not contest in 2023. I never mentioned anybody. I just talked about what I think we should be looking for in the next President. My take is that at the age of around 60 years, the person must have been a public servant, private entrepreneur, a professional and would have acquired a lot of experience to rule the country. That is all; I did not say it to rule out anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new breed I spoke of then (as president) are well over 60 now if I am not mistaking. So, you can see that they are qualified and must have acquired the necessary experience,\u201d he added.\n\nOn corruption, Babaginda said the problem can best be solved if tackled at source, adding that the decentralisation of governance, in the thinking of his military regime, was a sure way to fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cYou have to fight corruption from the beginning at its source. For example, we in the military thought if you decentralised governance, it is a sure way of getting rid of certain corrupt aspect of our behaviours.\u201d\n\nWhile listing some ways out of the menace, IBB, as fondly called, recalled that in those days, his administration put in place deliberate policies to check corruption in the process of obtaining foreign exchange from banks by establishing bureau de change.\n\nThe former leader said commodity control boards were also abolished so that cocoa and groundnut farmers would not have to bribe government officials for their produce to be rated Grade A or Grade B or give bribe to get licensed.\n\nHe stressed the need for more sensitisation of the people for them to know that they don\u2019t have to bribe government officials to get services, adding that \u201d the people must understand and government also needs to put in place more institutions to facilitate this aspect of our lives.\u201d\n\nOtedola recounts role in Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s dying days\n\nMeanwhile, billionaire businessman, Femi Otedola, has joined Nigerians in congratulating the former military leader ahead of his 80th birthday Tuesday.\n\nHe also recalled his role in the critical days of the Umar Yar\u2019Adua presidency when there was controversy around Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s health challenge in 2010.\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua failing to formally transfer power to his VP when he was flown abroad for medical treatment, there was tension across the nation as a result of the power vacuum, which led to public protests.\n\nRevealing this Sunday in a statement containing excerpts from his yet-to-be published book on business lessons (scheduled for release in November), Otedola revealed that Babangida sent a message through him to then Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan to occupy the empty seat of the President at the next Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\nWriting on the need for entrepreneurs to engage with political authorities in one of the chapters, Otedola said such a relationship will benefit the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cEntrepreneurs\u2019 outreach and dialogue with political leaders, among many positives, will ensure stability and social coherence, guaranteeing economic progress. Worried by the tension and uncertainty, I decided to do something on my own.\n\n\u201cIn the first week of February 2010, I went to Minna, Niger state, along with Hajiya Bola Shagaya, to commiserate with General Ibrahim Babangida over the death of his wife, Maryam. At his Hilltop residence, we spoke on a wide range of issues, but I told him I needed to discuss an urgent and vital issue. He took me to his study, where the two of us were alone. I told him that the state of the nation had been agitating my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, how can we get out of this logjam? The political heat is too much,\u201d recalled the oil mogul.\n\n\u201cCalm and resolute, IBB replied: \u2018Femi, advise your friend that when he gets to the Council Chambers next week for the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, he should go and sit on the President\u2019s chair.\u2019 I found that fascinating and assured him I would pass the message across. I travelled back to Abuja by road in the evening and went straight to have dinner with Dr Jonathan. I did not waste time in delivering General Babangida\u2019s message to him,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cHe nodded and asked me, \u2018What do you think? I laughed and said, \u2018Be a man, Your Excellency. Go and sit on that chair!\u2019 \u201cHe looked at me for some time and responded that he would think about it.\n\n\u201cA week later, on Tuesday, February 9, the National Assembly adopted the famous \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019 to make Dr Jonathan the Acting President pending the return of President Yar\u2019Adua from his medical leave. Behind-the-scene moves by prominent Nigerians preceded this decision. The legislative resolution was unprecedented, but the nation had been tensed up. The fault lines were so stoked that an unusual solution was needed to address the unique situation.\n\n\u201cWith Jonathan now legally empowered to act as President, there remained the critical optics: would he stand-in for the President confidently and authoritatively? Or would he try to maintain a subdued outlook? The following day was the FEC meeting. As Dr Jonathan entered the Council Chamber, he made to sit on the chair of the Vice President\u2014his usual seat. As the protocol officer pulled out the VP\u2019s chair, Dr Jonathan marched towards the seat reserved for the President. And he sat on it! That was the moment Dr Goodluck Jonathan took control of power. By that act, he sent a strong signal to all Nigerians that he was now in charge. The same day, Jonathan even reshuffled the cabinet,\u201d he further recalled.\n\nYar\u2019Adua died on May 5, 2010, and Jonathan was sworn in as his replacement, after which he served another four-year-tenure following his victory at the 2011 general elections.\n\nIn the book, Otedola said entrepreneurs must engage with political authorities because it is only when there is peace that the economy can boom.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWhile many may see political engagement for entrepreneurs as one-sided\u2014in the sense that only the entrepreneur benefits\u2014the reality is that it could work both ways. I tapped into my political connections to contribute my little quota to resolving a power crisis that almost set the country on fire. This example is one of the several instances in which I used my access to the seat of power and political heavyweights to contribute to nation-building and national development. Entrepreneurs need to appreciate the fact that peace for the country is peace for their businesses, too. We need a stable and peaceful country first and foremost.\u201d",

          "title": "Crumbling terrorists\u2019 dynasty and role of air power -NigPilot",
          "text": "The twin hydra-headed monsters of terrorism and insurgency, as well as other sundry evil dynasties, have slowed the wheel of economic growth and sustainable development in Nigeria for over one decade . These are in addition to human carnage, a threat to food security, unimaginable humanitarian crisis, and humongous destruction of properties, public and private across the theatre of operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest stories emanating from the theatre of operations suggest that the criminal dynasties are speedily crumbling to extinction writes our Defence Correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nIt was a Russian-American aviation pioneer, inventor, and influential advocate of strategic airpower, Alexander Nikolaievich Prokofiev de Seversky who posited that \u201cOnly air power can defeat airpower. The actual elimination or even stalemating of an attacking Air Force can be achieved only by a superior Air Force\u201d.\n\nRegrettably, the alleged infighting, rivalries, and lack of synergy amongst the tri-services and other security agencies in Nigeria, especially during the long tenure of the former Service Chiefs have no doubt slowed the defeat of Boko Haram, Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists and other adversaries of the state longer than necessary, even with the employment of airpower.\n\nReports of ragtag terrorists overrunning communities and military formations in the northeast theatre and carting away weapons including gun trucks from troops were sad commentaries in the history of unconventional warfare, that the Nigerian state and by extension the Nigerian military have wagged in the Northeast.\n\nOther issues that slowed down the speedy end to the counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in the country included but were not limited to the low morale of troops, orchestrated by poor remuneration, use of old fashioned and obsolete weapons to fight terrorists with sophisticated armaments, and war fatigue on the part of troops due to their staying longer than the stipulated period in the frontline.\n\nVideo of soldiers complaining of the above-enumerated factors still populate the nation\u2019s cyberspace and social media platforms. It is on record that Major General Olusegun Adeniyi openly complained about these in a viral video while serving in the northeast as the Theatre Commander.\n\nThen comes the issues of incessant military air mishaps that left so many countrymen shocked and dumbfounded, even as some critics found humor in the tragic situation and compared the horrific episodes to ripped oranges falling freely from its tree.\n\nHowever, while the nation awaits the day that government will declassify the investigative reports of these perennial crashes that consumed lives of top military brass, including a serving Chief of Army Staff (COAS), to know if the tragedies were caused by a mechanical fault, human error or natural occurrence, it is also imperative to look at some of the factors that led to the incapacitation of the terrorist dynasty.\n\nNevertheless, it was at the burial of the seven Air Force personnel that died in the crashed Beechcraft King Air B350i on February 21, while laboring to secure the release of the staff and students abducted from the Government Science College Kagara, Niger State, that the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao vowed to deal with the criminal elements.\n\nHe noted that the death of the officers and airmen ought to spur the rest of Nigerians to relentlessly expose and fight crimes.\n\n\u201cWe must throw everything that we have into this fight to ensure that our departed colleagues did not die in vain,\u201d he threatened.\n\nThe CAS who almost submitted to tears in grief, said, \u201cI stand here today bearing my personal grief as well as the entire NAF and the country as we lay to rest the remains of our fallen colleagues while in active duty to the Service of their fatherland.\n\n\u201cI must confess that even at this moment, NAF is still in palpable shock and grieving very deeply upon this loss of our gallant and courageous heroes\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cTheir death is a huge loss to the NAF family and indeed the entire nation. They will be greatly missed but fondly remembered for their invaluable services to the nation and humanity\u201d.\n\nJust last week, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), in its bi-weekly briefing on military operations across the federation disclosed that no fewer than one thousand (1000) Boko Haram and Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists laid down their arms and surrendered to the state forces alongside their families.\n\nWhat this new development presupposes is the fact that the nation\u2019s military and by extension the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) is making truth the threat by the CAS that the sacrifices of the fallen heroes can not be in vain and therefore had spurred them to shatter the foundation of terrorism and insurgency in Nigeria.\n\nThe Acting Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who shared the testimony of how the terrorists\u2019 empire is crumbling, while briefing Defence correspondents, also disclosed that no fewer than one hundred and fifty-six (156) criminal elements including terrorists and bandits were killed within the same period.\n\nWhile disclosing that eighty-nine (89) livestock were intercepted from cattle rustlers, the Acting Director also revealed that no fewer than thirty-three (33) kidnaped victims were rescued by the troops within the period under review.\n\nGeneral Onyeuko said that various kinetic operations were carried out to deny terrorists, armed bandits, and other criminal elements freedom of action as well as the frustrate movement of arms and other illegal items in all theatres of operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Headquarters of Operation HADIN KAI has intensified its operations in the North East theatre. The intensity of these operations has yielded tremendous results as evidenced in the number of casualties and massive surrender of terrorists in Buni Yari, Gorgore, Baga, and Monguno Towns as well as Maiduguri \u2013 Baga Road, Maiduguri \u2013 Damboa Road, and Bula Yobe \u2013 Darel Jamel Road. Operations were also carried out at Kayamri and Mairari villages as well as Monguno and Kukawa Towns, all in Borno State.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, the operations led to the neutralization of 27 BHT/ISWAP fighters, arrest of 51 BHT/ISWAP terrorists, 3 terrorists\u2019 collaborators as well as recovery of 35 assorted arms and 1,051 round of ammunition including AK-47 and FN rifles, Dushka anti-aircraft guns, GPMG, PKT guns, 60mm mortar tubes, Makarov pistol and other machine guns, amongst other items. In addition, 29 abducted civilians were rescued within the period under review. Gentlemen no fewer than 1,000 terrorists and their families comprising adult females and children surrendered to their own troops at different locations in the North East. Notable among them is the notorious BHT bomb expert named, Musa Adamu aka Mala Musa Abuja, and his deputy, Usman Adamu aka Abu Darda. This has in no small measure depleted the BHT fighting force\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Borno State Governor, Babagana Umara Zulum, on Saturday last week in Gwoza, received another Chibok Girl who presented herself to the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe schoolgirl, Hassana Adamu, alongside her two children, was handed over to Governor Zulum by the Commander, 26 Taskforce Brigade, Brigadier General DR Dantani.\n\nHassana was one of over 200 schoolgirls abducted at a Government Secondary School in Chibok on April 14, 2014, by Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nRecall that Ruth Ngladar Pogu and a man said to be her husband had earlier presented themselves to the Nigerian Army on July 28, 2021, at a location in Bama.\n\nThese and many more are clear indications that the terrorism and insurgency dynasties are not only crumbling to the ashes but the needed peace that would user in prosperity and food security is knocking hard on the doorsteps of residents of North-East who had abandoned their ancestral homes and taken refuge in makeshift IDP camps where hunger and fear were their known companion.\n\nThe above advancement to the gate of hope of an end to terrorism in Nigeria is not unconnected with combined air and artillery bombardment of terrorist enclaves and armory, as well as a huge investment in the procurement of platforms and capacity building of manpower to intensifies employment of airpower.\n\nSupporting the earlier quote on the imperative of airpower in fighting all kinds of war, the United Kingdom wartime leader, Sir Winston Churchill, averred that, \u201cThe Navy can lose us the war, but only the Air Force can win it. The fighters are our salvation, but the bombers alone provide the means of victory\u201d.\n\nAlso giving credence and legitimacy to the above proposition, an American journalist, author, and critic of United States foreign policy, William Henry Blum said: \u201cA terrorist is someone who has a bomb, but doesn\u2019t have an Air Force\u201d.\n\nHowever, the cheering news of the decapitation of terrorist groups by the combined artillery and air bombardment is not unconnected with huge investment in the procurement of modern armaments and training of personnel by the incumbent administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIt is on record that the NAF recently conducted a holistic assessment of its combat efficiency in order to determine requirements, in terms of air platforms, armament, communication, manpower, and medical, amongst others, to raise the efficiency of the Service to appropriate levels to meet current and emerging national security imperatives.\n\nTo feel the identified gap, available statistics reveal that in the last six (6) years, the incumbent administration acquired 26 brand new aircraft to boost the combat readiness of the NAF.\n\nThe data further disclosed that the newly acquired aircraft include ten (10) Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, five (5) new Mi-35M helicopter gunships, and two (2) Bell 412 helicopters.\n\nOthers include four (4) Agusta 109 Power attack helicopters, two (2) Mi-171E helicopters, and more recently, three (3) JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter aircraft.\n\n\u201cOn 30th August 2021, we would witness the induction of six (6) A-29 Super Tucano aircraft out of the twelve (12) already purchased by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. It is expected that the remaining six (6) A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, as well as some Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles which will arrive the country before the end of the year, will boost NAF\u2019s air power employment capabilities in support of joint operations.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, through the unwavering support of President Buhari, twenty (20) previously grounded aircraft including the Falcon 900, ATR-42, Beechcraft, Super Puma, F-7Ni, EC-135, Do-228, Mi-24V, Mi-35P, C-130H, L-39ZA, and Alpha Jet aircraft have been reactivated. Additionally, for the first time in its history, the NAF successfully conducted multiple in-country Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM) on two (2) C-130H, 3 L-39ZA aircraft, 2 Mi-35P helicopters as well as three (3) Alpha Jet aircraft,\u201d the information posited.\n\nAlso, the acquisitions and reactivation as well as the emplacement of robust logistics support structure have enabled the NAF to raise the serviceability status of operable aircraft from about 35 percent in 2015 to about 72% as of 2 August 2021.\n\nOther military source shows that to ensure the sustainability of the newly acquired platforms, the Federal Government in the last six (6) years invested substantially in the training and retraining of NAF personnel both locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cThe NAF has winged over 133 pilots while 233 other personnel of various trades are currently undergoing training. Similarly, the enhancement of training facilities at the 401 Flying Training School (401 FTS) Kaduna has improved the training capacity of the school. As a result, for the first time in about three (3) decades, 401 FTS was able to complete ab-initio flying training for cadets of the Nigerian Defence Academy before their commissioning as officers.\n\n\u201cIn the aspect of aircraft serviceability, the NAF has trained and retrained engineers and technicians to ensure adequate maintenance of its fleet. These efforts at enhancing NAF\u2019s fleet as well as building the capacity of personnel have no doubt reflected on NAF\u2019s operational output. Coupled with the renewed and enhanced synergy among the Services and other security agencies, the acquisition and employment of these platforms has yielded tangible results in the fight against insurgency in the Northeast while recording gains in the fight against armed bandits, kidnappers, and other criminal elements in the Northwest and North Central theatres,\u201d the sources explained.\n\nWhile enumerating some of these visible gains, the available record shows that \u201cfrom January 2021 till date, the Air Component elements of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) conducted 1,015 missions in 1,357 sorties and logging 1,861hrs. The most recent achievements recorded in the OPHK Theatre included the provision of Close Air Support (CAS) to ground troops in combat with ISWAP forces equipped with twelve (12) GTs and two (2) Armoured Personnel Carriers at Damboa, Borno State on 3 June 21. Here, NAF aircraft prevented the troop\u2019s location from being overrun and inflicted heavy casualties on the ISWAP forces leading to their eventual withdraw.\n\nAir interdiction and CAS missions were also conducted at Lamboa on 20 June 21 against ISWAP elements with all five (5) of their gun trucks destroyed and several terrorists neutralized.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on 27 June 21, CAS provided for ground troops in combat with ISWAP forces at Bula Yobe on 27 Jun 21. The air operations destroyed three (3) gun trucks, neutralized many terrorists, and prevented our troop\u2019s location from being overrun. The successes recorded by NAF\u2019s air component also extended to Operation HADARIN DAJI (OPHD) in the Northwest as well.\n\n\u201cIndeed, from January 2021 to date, the air component of OPHD conducted 591 missions in 692 sorties with 943 hours flown. These operations led to the rescue of some kidnapped students whilst providing CAS for troops on clearance operations in various locations resulting in the destruction of bandit camps. Within the same period, the air component of Operation THUNDER STRIKE (OPTS) conducted 500 missions in 630 sorties with 975 hours flown with tangible results in the areas of curtailed cattle rustling, kidnapping, and banditry.\n\n\u201cThe NAF also made significant contributions to the results achieved in Operations WHIRL STROKE in the North Central; DELTA SAFE in the South-South and AWATSE in the Southwest. These efforts and successes recorded no doubt were realizable due to the improvement and enhancement in NAF\u2019s air fleet inventory that comprises aircraft of various capabilities required for different types of operations\u201d.\n\nThe statistics further stated that while the NAF had sustained its kinetic operations, it has also continued to devote resources to non-kinetic operations aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the civil populace.\n\nThese it also posited was achieved through the provision of medical facilities and school feeding programs in IDP Camps in Borno State, the conduct of medical outreaches to host communities of NAF Units across the country, provision of airlift in support of the National COVID-19 response, and availing host communities of NAF schools and medical facilities.\n\nPointing out some of the things the Nigerian Air Force has done to address of some the anomy highlighted in the preceding paragraphs, the verifiable records shows that the Service has dedicated significant time and resources to capacity building of personnel of other support trades, whilst placing a high premium on the welfare of personnel and their families to ensure enhanced performance in the field.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of personnel has also received close attention as the NAF have renovated/remodeled and constructed new blocks of classrooms and hostel accommodation in existing NAF schools across the country. In the same vein, the NAF has vigorously engaged in massive construction and renovation of residential accommodation to reduce the accommodation challenges in our bases.\n\n\u201cThe NAF has also sustained its efforts at expanding the post-service housing schemes to ease the burden of post-service life settlement for our personnel. All these were done as part of efforts to bolster morale by improving personnel welfare for effective and efficient service delivery. Healthwise, the NAF unveiled the telemedicine portal to ease personnel\u2019s access to quality healthcare that transcends borders,\u201d the information added.\n\nWhile noting that the Nigerian Air Force College of Nursing was also upgraded and accredited to offer HND programs, an insider source equally revealed that the NAF has also continued to invest heavily in Research and Development especially in Unmanned Aerial Systems technology, rockets, and rocket launchers, heat shield protective cones for the Alpha Jet rocket pods, among others.\n\nAt this juncture, it is also important to conclude by agreeing with the American journalist and former British Prime Minister that airpower is the game-changer in conventional and unconventional warfare. The terrorist fighters in the northeast are not surrendering to state forces because they have repented but because they can no longer withstand the rain of bombs falling inside their hideouts from Nigerian Air Force fighter jets and helicopter gunships.",

Abdulfatah AbdulRahman said \u201cyou will vividly recall that we cited various reasons why we opted out of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in our rally held on 19th June 2021 at M.M event center, such as the inability of the APC to demonstrate fairness, equity and provision of a level playing field for every member of the party\u201d\n\n\u201cProtracted intra-party crises, that have shown no signs of abating, saying excluding the majority of the party members across the state from exercising their legitimate rights during the membership registration and revalidation exercise was a clear signal that the current administration in kwara is not interested in securing popular mandate at the next elections\u201d\n\nAdded that the above reasons have given cause for the group to look for an alternative, viable political party where every individual can participate fully in the affairs of the party.\n\nStating the reason why the group settled for YPP, AbdulFatah said \u201cwe have reached out to the existing registered political parties in Nigeria.

          "text": "The Community Parliament of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has said that lack of resources and ignorance is the bane of energy efficiency in West Africa.\n\nThe Parliament regretted that businesses and individuals are not\n\ncapitalizing on the opportunities in the sector, due to barriers, such as lack\n\nof awareness, as well as non-availability of resources.\n\nThe Speaker of ECOWAS Parliament Rt. Hon. Sidie Mohamed Tunis said this at the closing of the ECOWAS Parliament delocalized meeting of the Joint Committee on Energy and Mines, Industry and Private Sector, Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, which was held in Cote D\u2019 Ivoire\n\nHe noted that the meeting facilitated the sharing of information, approaches, and practical applications in effective energy management.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe meeting, in line with its specific objectives, sought to understand the greater issues of energy efficiency measures, build capability in energy management, encouraging research and development in energy-efficient technologies and raise the awareness of the public on the role of the private sector in energy conservation.\n\n\u201cThat is why there could have been no better theme than the one selected for this meeting, which is \u2018Ensuring energy efficiency in West Africa through innovation, active involvement of the private sector and citizen participation.\n\n\u201cEven more important was the disclosure of the opportunities that energy efficiency provides and how investments in energy provide relatively quick returns with a high degree of certainty\u201d.\n\nWhile noting that improving energy efficiency is about dollars and cents, the Speaker said that its impact on society is far-reaching.\n\nHe explained that the Parliament is inclined to emphasize that private sector engagement is fundamental to the community goal of achieving energy efficiency.\n\n\u201cAs one of the most powerful forces for improving lives, strengthening\n\ncommunities, and accelerating countries towards self-reliance, private-\n\nsector engagement\u2014and the approaches it leverages\u2014builds the skills,\n\nresources, knowledge, and incentives needed to improve the sector.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, in an effort to manage the Energy sector, Governments can be the effective regulators, while the private sector addresses issues relating to access and provide technical and operational capacity. Moreover, a lot can be done to reduce investors\u2019 perception of risk. Public finance is expected to\n\nplay a crucial role in creating the enabling environment, using public funds as a mobilization tool to attract private capital.\n\n\u201cGovernments can ensure commitment to long-term policies and necessary regulatory tools, in addition\n\nto creating special lending facilities aiming to provide direct support and facilitate renewable energy,\u201d he further explained.\n\nHon. Tunis observed that to improve the standard of living across our region, we must continuously explore newer technologies and\n\ninnovations.",

That mission has been successful.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s imminent takeover triggered fear and panic in Kabul among residents fearful of the group\u2019s hardline brand of Islam.\n\n\u2013 Evacuations \u2013\n\nThe scale and speed of the insurgents\u2019 advance have shocked Afghans and the US-led alliance that poured billions into the country over the past two decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 1,000 US troops to help secure the emergency evacuation from Kabul of embassy employees and thousands of Afghans who worked for American forces and now fear Taliban reprisals.\n\nThat was on top of the 3,000 American soldiers deployed in recent days, and 1,000 left in-country after Biden announced in May that the final withdrawal of the US military presence in Afghanistan would be completed by September 11.\n\nThat decision has come under increased scrutiny given the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, but he insisted Saturday there was no choice.\n\n\u201cI was the fourth president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan \u2014 two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth,\u201d Biden said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Canada Temporarily Closes Embassy In Kabul\n\nGhani\u2019s government was left completely isolated on Sunday after the insurgents overran the anti-Taliban northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif and the eastern city of Jalalabad.\n\nLike with most of the other captured cities, the seizure of power came after government forces surrendered or retreated.\n\nVideos posted on pro-Taliban social media accounts showed the group\u2019s heavily armed fighters in cities across the country, waving white flags and greeting locals.\n\nMost of the fighters appeared young, suggesting they were most likely infants or unborn when the Taliban was toppled from power in 2001.\n\n\u2013 Panic \u2013\n\nAs the Taliban closed in on the capital, panicked residents swarmed banks for a second straight day, hoping to withdraw their savings.\n\nMany were already resigned to the Taliban taking power.\n\n\u201cMy only wish is that their return leads to peace. That is all we want,\u201d said Kabul shopkeeper Tariq Nezami.\n\nREAD ALSO: Albania Ready To Welcome Hundreds Of Afghan Refugees\n\nA worker was seen Sunday whitewashing advertising billboards on a beauty parlour featuring a glamorous bride.\n\nFor the tens of thousands who have sought refuge in Kabul in recent weeks, the overwhelming mood was one of apprehension and fear.\n\nOne doctor who arrived in the capital with his 35-strong family from Kunduz said he planned to return.\n\n\u201cI am worried there will be a lot of fighting here. I would rather return home, where I know it has stopped,\u201d he told AFP, asking not to be named.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Muhammadu Buhari: Africa Needs More Than US Military Aid to Defeat Terror",
          "text": "Building infrastructure, connecting remote regions and providing jobs will strengthen the continent\u2019s defences\n\nThough some believe the war on terror winds down with the US departure from Afghanistan, the threat it was supposed to address burns fiercely on my continent.\n\nAfrica is the new frontline of global militancy. Yet few expect the outlay expended here to be as great as in Afghanistan.\n\nThe fight against terrorism begun under the George W Bush administration was never truly global.\n\nDespite rising attacks across Africa in the past decade, international assistance has not followed in step.\n\nMozambique is merely the latest African state in danger from terrorism. The Sahel remains vulnerable to Boko Haram, 20 years after its formation, and other radical groups.\n\nSomalia is in its second decade fighting the equally extreme al-Shabaab.\n\nMany African nations are submerged under the weight of insurgency.\n\nAs Africans, we face our day of reckoning just as some sense the west is losing its will for the fight.\n\nIt is true that some of our western allies are bruised by their Middle Eastern and Afghan experiences. Others face domestic pressures after the pandemic.\n\nAfrica was not then, and even less now, their priority. But the threat cannot be ignored.\n\nCovid-19 has been like oxygen for terrorism, allowing it to gain in strength while the world was preoccupied. Sooner or later, the reverberations will be felt beyond Africa. If extremist groups are able to hold territory, it can inspire disillusioned people living in the West to commit heinous acts of terror in their own countries.\n\nThe self-proclaimed caliphate of Daesh in Iraq and Syria fulfilled that propaganda function, boosting transcontinental recruitment. We must not complacently assume that military means alone can defeat the terrorists. If Afghanistan has taught us a lesson, it is that although sheer force can blunt terror, its removal can cause the threat to return.\n\nThe US and its western allies cannot be expected to underpin the security of others everywhere and indefinitely. Africa has enough soldiers of our own. However, more can be done to help with technical assistance, advanced weaponry, intelligence and ordinance.\n\nThe US air strikes last month against al-Shabaab in Somalia \u2014 the first of the Biden administration \u2014 show what can and should be done. But what Africa needs most from the US is a comprehensive partnership to close the disparity between our economic and demographic growth.\n\nDespite having six of the world\u2019s top 10 fastest-growing economies, my continent\u2019s gross domestic product gains are insufficient to provide for burgeoning populations.\n\nSince the start of the US-led war on terror in 2001, Africa\u2019s population has nearly doubled. Every day, every month, this means more unemployed or underemployed entering the labour market, far outstripping economic expansion.\n\nA lack of hope is the chief recruiting sergeant for the continent\u2019s new brand of terrorism.\n\nWhat we need above all is investment in infrastructure. Transport and freight lines can spread opportunity across nations unequal in economic strength.\n\nIn parts of Africa, a government\u2019s grip on remote territories can be tenuous. Militant groups step into the void. Some even provide a form of governance, however perverse.\n\nThese areas must be connected with their surroundings. The recent attacks in Cabo Delgado in northern Mozambique illustrate the point. Their target was a vast natural gas project, part of an international investment which extracts wealth but provides few jobs for locals.\n\nThis fuels grievances in a poverty-stricken province. It is a landing pad for the likes of Daesh.\n\nThat is why we in Nigeria have begun building a train line from the southern coast through the north-east to Niger, our neighbour.\n\nMy government has been accused of wasting money, because trade between our two nations is minimal. But that is hardly a surprise, given that there is no trade infrastructure between us.\n\nThe train line will pay dividends in security, a prerequisite for economic growth. Some will remember that Boko Haram originated in north-eastern Nigeria, along the border with Niger.\n\nFirst, they agitated against a lack of opportunity. Then they radicalised into the terrorists we face today. The US already has schemes such as Power Africa, which invests in the continent\u2019s essential energy infrastructure. However, more must be done.\n\nUltimately, Africans need not swords but ploughshares to defeat terror. Yes, we require the technological and intelligence support that our armies do not possess. Yet the boots we need on the ground are those of constructors, not the military.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fight against terror is the world\u2019s fight. We will defeat them one highway, one rail link \u2014 and one job \u2014 at a time.\n\nThe author, Muhammadu Buhari is President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria",

Marburg virus disease is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola.\n\nTransmission of both diseases occurs through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissue, while symptoms include headache, vomiting blood, muscle pains and bleeding.\n\nThe WHO said there was no indication the current case in Ivory Coast is linked to the outbreak in Guinea earlier this year. It said further investigation and genomic sequencing will identify the strain and determine if there was a connection.\n\n\u201cIt is of immense concern that this outbreak has been declared in Abidjan, a metropolis of more than 4 million people,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, much of the world\u2019s expertise in tackling Ebola is here on the continent and Ivory Coast can tap into this experience and bring the response to full speed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe WHO said it was helping to coordinate a cross-border response, which included transferring 5,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine from Guinea to Ivory Coast.",

          "text": "A powerful earthquake has struck the Caribbean nation of Haiti, killing at least 304 people and injuring more than 1,800.\n\nThe 7.2-magnitude quake hit the west of the country on Saturday morning, toppling and damaging buildings including churches and hotels.\n\nThe prime minister said there was \u201cextensive damage\u201d and declared a month-long state of emergency.\n\nHaiti is still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake.\n\nThe epicentre of Saturday\u2019s quake was about 12km (7.5 miles) from the town of Saint-Louis du Sud, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.\n\nDamaged buildings as people inspect after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake\n\nThe tremor was felt in the densely-populated capital of Port-au-Prince, some 125km away, and in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cLots of homes are destroyed, people are dead and some are at the hospital,\u201d Christella Saint Hilaire, who lives near the epicentre, told AFP news agency.\n\nPrime Minister Ariel Henry said he had mobilised a team to work on the relief effort.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people.\u201d\n\nMr Henry later revealed he had flown in a plane over the city of Cayes.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has authorised an \u201cimmediate US response\u201d to help Haiti and said USAID would work to support efforts to \u201cassess the damage and assist efforts to recover those who were injured and those who must now rebuild\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn what is already a challenging time for the people of Haiti, I am saddened by the devastating earthquake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe USGS earlier warned that the earthquake could result in thousands of fatalities and injuries. It also said several aftershocks had been felt in the region, including one measuring 5.8 magnitude.\n\nFrantz Duval, editor-in-chief of Haiti\u2019s Le Nouvelliste newspaper, tweeted that two hotels were among the buildings destroyed in the town of Les Cayes. He said the local hospital was overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cSlowly, strongly and for very long seconds the earth shook in Haiti on 14 August, 2021 around 8:30 am,\u201d he wrote.\n\nReporters at Le Nouvelliste later said the majority of churches and hotels on the south coast had collapsed or suffered major damage.\n\nArchdeacon Abiade Lozama, head of an Episcopal church in Les Cayes, told the New York Times: \u201cThe streets are filled with screaming. People are searching, for loved ones or resources, medical help, water.\u201d\n\nPhotos shared on social media showed damaged buildings and piles of rubble after the quake.\n\nLeila Bourahla, Haiti director of Save the Children, told the New York Times it would take days to assess the damage but \u201cit is clear that this is a massive humanitarian emergency\u201d.\n\nNaomi Verneus, a 34-year-old resident of the capital Port-au-Prince, told the Associated Press news agency she was woken up by the earthquake and that her bed was shaking.\n\n\u201cI woke up and didn\u2019t have time to put my shoes on. We lived [through] the 2010 earthquake and all I could do was run. I later remembered my two kids and my mother were still inside. My neighbour went in and told them to get out. We ran to the street,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 2010 earthquake in Haiti killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy.\n\nSaturday\u2019s earthquake comes amid a political crisis in the country, following the assassination of its president last month.\n\nTennis star Naomi Osaka, who is of Japanese and Haitian descent, tweeted her solidarity with Haiti.\n\nReferring to next week\u2019s Western & Southern Open, the four-time Grand Slam winner wrote: \u201cI\u2019m about to play a tournament this week and I\u2019ll give all the prize money to relief efforts for Haiti. I know our ancestors\u2019 blood is strong we\u2019ll keep rising.\u201d",
