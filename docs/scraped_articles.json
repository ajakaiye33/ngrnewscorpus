          "title": "Medical tourism: Reps propose seven-year imprisonment, N500m fine for officials",
          "text": "Leke Baiyewu\n\nA bill seeking to prescribe a jail term of seven years and/or a fine of N500m for officials who spend public funds on foreign medical trips narrowly passed second reading at the House of Representatives on Wednesday.\n\nSponsored by Sergius Ogun (PDP, Edo), the proposed legislation is titled, \u2018A Bill for an Act to amend the National Health Act, 2014; and for related matters\u2019.\n\nLeading the debate on the bill, Ogun noted that the objective of the proposed law was to amend the Act \u201cso as to make provision for sanctions against any public officer, who violates the provisions of the Act, especially Section 46 of the Act\u201d.\n\nThe section reads, \u201cWithout prejudice to the right of any Nigerian to seek medical check-up, investigation or treatment anywhere within and outside Nigeria, no public officer of the government of the federation or any part thereof shall be sponsored for medical check-up, investigation or treatment abroad at public expense, except in exceptional cases on the recommendation and referral by the medical board and which recommendation and referral shall be duly approved by the minister or commissioner of Health of the state as the case may be\u201d.\n\nOgun said, \u201cThis bill, which seeks to amend the National Health Act, is borne out of a desire to discourage medical treatment abroad at the detriment of our indigenous health institutions. The need to revamp the poor state of the health care sector in Nigeria, among other things, is the reason for introducing this bill.\n\n\u201cIt is no news that Nigeria\u2019s health care system is in a deplorable state and needs urgent attention. There is paucity of infrastructure, dearth of medical personnel, poor standards and many other challenges that need to be addressed. The intent of this bill is to spur public officers to pay more attention to our health care sector and take drastic steps to develop and improve on the sector.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker urged members of the House to look at the merits of the bill and let it pass \u201cin the interest of our nation, which is currently going through trying times and requires drastic steps to bring it back on its footing\u201d.\n\nOgun listed the merits of the bill to include the reduction of the exodus of doctors from Nigeria to other countries.\n\n\u201cIf this House passes this bill into law, it will curtail the excessive medical trips of public officers abroad and direct their attention to fixing the poor state of the country\u2019s health sector. This will, in turn, lead to the development of the health sector and improved remuneration for medical doctors, thus attracting Nigerian doctors abroad to come back home,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe lawmaker also noted that the bill, when passed into law, would demonstrate the government\u2019s commitment to the welfare of citizens, \u201cin the sense that funds, which were hitherto expended on foreign medical trips, will be redirected into building an efficient and effective health care system in the country. This will in turn positively impact the lives and wellbeing of the people\u201d.\n\nOgun also cited the reduction of capital flight abroad, saying, \u201cThis bill, as stressed above, will stop the export of cash abroad and redirect the same to the development of our economy.\n\n\u201cAll of this cash, which flies abroad in the disguise of one medical trip or the other, will be retained here in our country and be used to develop our nation.\u201d\n\nWhile Ogun was making his presentation, the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase, interjected him, asking if the lawmaker was sure of what he was saying.\n\nResponding, Ogun noted that the Act prohibited unapproved spending of government funds on foreign medical services, but it failed to prescribe punishment for disobeying the law.\n\n\u201cI read the Act and the gazette is here. I was not in this Assembly then. It is an Act; it is a law of the land today. What I am basically doing\u2026, my amendment is saying that there should be punishment for flouting that Act, which the Act did not capture. It could be (due to) an oversight,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe lawmaker, therefore, proposed the insertion of Clause 2(2) to read, \u201cAny public officer of the government of the federation or any part thereof, who violates the provision of sub-section (1) above shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine of N500,000,000 or to an imprisonment term of seven years, or both\u201d.\n\nThe proposed punishment, however, generated murmurs in the chamber.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nThe World Health Organisation says that if current trends continue, the continent can control the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022.\n\nThe WHO, however, warned that continued vigilance is crucial to taming the viral pandemic.\n\nThe global health body said over the last two years, the continent has witnessed four waves of COVID-19, each with higher peaks or more total new cases than the previous one.\n\nIt said the surges have been mostly driven by new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2014which were highly transmissible though not necessarily more fatal than prior waves.\n\n\u201cEach subsequent wave has triggered a response that has been more effective than the previous, with each surge shorter by 23 percent on average from the one before. While the first wave lasted about 29 weeks, the fourth wave was over in six weeks, or about a fifth of the time,\u201d it said in a press statement on Thursday.\n\nWHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti said over the past two years, the African continent has gotten smarter, faster, and better at responding to each new surge in cases of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAgainst the odds, including huge inequities in access to vaccination, we\u2019ve weathered the COVID-19 storm with resilience and determination, informed by Africa\u2019s long history and experience with controlling outbreaks. But COVID-19 has cost us dearly, with more than 242 000 lives lost and tremendous damage to our economies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to have pushed up to 40 million people into extreme poverty on the continent, and every month of delay in lifting containment measures is estimated to cost Africa US$ 13.8 billion in lost gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cAlthough COVID-19 will be with us for the long-term, there is light at the end of the tunnel. This year we can end the disruption and destruction the virus has left in its path, and gain back control over our lives,\u201d added Dr. Moeti. \u201cControlling this pandemic must be a priority, but we understand no two countries have had the same pandemic experience, and each country must, therefore, chart its own way out of this emergency.\u201d\n\nWHO noted that when Africa experienced its first wave, attributed to the spread of the wild SARS-CoV-2 virus, the average case fatality ratio\u2014or the proportion of infected people who die from COVID-19\u2014was high (2.5 percent).\n\nIt further revealed that the figure rose to 2.7 percent during the Beta-driven second wave, before going back down to 2.4 percent during the Delta-powered third wave. In contrast, the average CFR during the fourth wave is low (0.8 percent), representing the first time a wave\u2019s surge in cases has not led to a commensurate increase in hospitalizations and deaths.\n\n\u201cSince the start of the pandemic, the continent\u2019s capacity to manage COVID-19 cases has gradually improved, with the increased availability of trained health workers, oxygen and other medical supplies. The number of Intensive Care Unit beds has increased across the continent, from 8 per 1 million people in 2020 to 20 today.\n\n\u201cWHO has also helped increase the number of oxygen production plants in Africa from 68 to 115 \u2013 a 60 percent rise \u2013 through supporting the repair, maintenance, and procurement of new oxygen plants. Where plants have been set up, the cost of oxygen has decreased by 40 percent. Despite these improvements, oxygen availability remains a concern, and a large majority of patients who require oxygen as part of their clinical treatment plan are unable to access it,\u201d it said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Onyendu still insisted that this obvious infraction should be addressed at the appropriate forum because it constitutes a violation of positive order of the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe visit proceeded smoothly and personal notes were taken of Onyendu\u2019s erudite views/contributions towards a successful outing come 16th day of February, 2021.\n\n\u201cOnyendu was equally briefed on the level of progress on other matters simultaneously going on in other courts affecting other young Igbo youths still in solitary confinement of the detaining authority, who are yet to be formally arraigned in court. Other details in relation to this brief shall remain private.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs usual, Onyendu appreciated his ardent supporters who have remained unshaken and resolute even in the face of obvious tribulations and sabotage. Please, be reassured that this month is a month of uncommon victory. Do not be distracted by the desperate contrive of the enemies of Umuchineke, which is now obviously coming in different dimension and being orchestrated by moles,\u201d IPOB said.\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",

If not for this programme, I am suppose to be at the very important meeting, believed to be the major determinant for the fate of the bill.\u201d\n\nHe, however, assured Nigerians that the bill would most likely be assented to by the president since issues earlier raised by him in the 2021 edition were elaborately addressed by both chambers of the National Assembly in January.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think in few days time, Mr President will do the needful since the most contentious aspect of the bill had been addressed in the reworked one transmitted to him on Monday, January 31, 2022. Time is of essence, but I believe that Mr President will do the needful,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the assurance given by Omoworare was not enough to douse the apprehension entertained by conveners of the dialogue who received message from the AGF that his planned consultation with President Buhari prevented him from coming .\n\nVirtually all the discussants at the policy dialogue, from former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Attahiru Jega; Country Representative of Westminster Foundation for Democracy, Adebowale Olorunmola and Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Media, Benjamin Kalu, appealed to President Buhari to assent to the bill without further delay.\n\nJega in particular said no law or legislation is perfect, but that what was made available now by the lawmakers, is good and manageable for the coming elections.\n\nRepresentative of INEC at the discourse, Prof. Bolade Eyinla, said to avoid the problem of working on electoral laws at the tail end of conducting elections, INEC should be allowed to drive the process as is done in Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe situation at hand now is that roughly a year to the general election, the anticipated laws are not yet approved, meaning that the extant one will be used aside the fact that the process has not enabled INEC to come up with clear cut guidelines for conduct of the elections,\u201d he lamented.\n\nMeanwhile, the Transition Monitoring Group, (TMG), National Consultative Front (NCFront) and Middle Belt Forum (MBF), yesterday, expressed worry over President Buhari\u2019s delay to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThey wondered why the bill was still lying on the president\u2019s desk, about 10 days after the National Assembly reworked it to include the three primary options, including direct, indirect and consensus which President Buhari observed were not in the first bill transmitted to him.\n\nAuwal Ibrahim Musa Rafsanjani, Executive Director Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre( CISLAC) and Chairman Transition Monitoring Group, said President Buhari has proved himself to be untrustworthy by delaying assent to the bill after the lawmakers worked on the areas he pointed out.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari is just telling us that he doesn\u2019t care about the country and doesn\u2019t care about anybody. It is sad and unfortunate that a president who talks so much about integrity is challenging that integrity. Integrity is about honesty and being consistent. The president pointed out areas he wanted to be corrected before he signs the bill; those areas have been corrected and he is still delaying assent. This will really put the Independent National Electoral Commission in a difficult position to conduct the election.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the NCFront Convener and a former presidential adviser, Prof Pat Utomi, said the delay and claims that the president was consulting on the bill before he takes necessary action shows that something was amiss.\n\nPresident Buhari withheld assent to the amended bill initially transmitted to him in November 2021 and insisted that it restricted the mode for political parties to choose candidates for election to direct primary mode, which he said was undemocratic.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nUtomi, however, faulted the position of the president and noted that his understanding of democracy is that the president should consult the party and the people on issues that needed action.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu noted that it was too early to take a definite stand on why the assent is delayed as Buhari has 30 days to do so.\n\nBut, a lawyer and former president of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, said President Buhari is playing a power game and alleged an attempt by those who think they own Nigeria to manipulate the system.\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives has said that there was no selfish interest in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill passed by the National Assembly, recently.\n\nChairman, House Committee on Media and Publicity, Benjamin Kalu, stated this while fielding questions from journalists, yesterday, in Abuja.\n\nHe said the National Assembly will not lobby the Presidency to assent to the electoral act amendment bill, as that would amount to interfering with the function of the executive.\n\n\u201cWe are three arms of government. Though we are three, we are one government and it will be interfering within the parameters of our mandate not to allow them the independency as proposed by the constitution.\n\n\u201cThey should be allowed the free hand to make decisions based on what we have proffered as a reflection of the wishes, hunger and desire of the common Nigerians\n\n\u201c The executive should be able to trust the parliament enough to know that what we speak remains the voice of the people and not our own voices.\u201d\n\nKalu said the National Assembly was guided by public interest in enacting laws, and that the lawmakers had given Nigerians the electoral law they sought for.\n\n\u201cIn view of the dynamics of the society, challenges we have experienced, the 2010 electoral act is obsolete, and therefore, can no longer meet the demands, expectations, ethos and principles of democracy. If we are serious about advancing our democracy, we should stop playing to the gallery.\n\n\u201cWe should do what the public interest says. And what is the public interest? That they want the electoral act amendment bill, as submitted, having incorporated the direct, indirect and consensus. Let us move on and that\u2019s not selfish interest. That\u2019s public interest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever actions that we take, motions moved, resolution and bills that we make, we make not as unto ourselves to the exclusion of others, we make them to the generality of Nigerians because for now, we are members of the parliament. Who knows tomorrow, we might be in the executive or even be outside the government.\n\n\u201cThe laws we make today will be there to govern us in time to come as citizens of this country. So, the element of selfishness should be removed from our ideas on this particular piece of legislation.\n\n\u201cAll we have maintained, what has guided us is nothing but to increase transparency, accountability, competitiveness and fairness in our electoral system,\u201d he said.",

We went to see Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, who is the chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, to tell him of our position so that he would convey this position to his colleagues.

We feel those in Arewa Consultative Forum who are holding on to the belief that the North should continue holding the presidency by 2023 should have a rethink.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people in the North who feel the presidency has to move to the South and what is bad is bad no matter how much you would want to garnish it.

          "title": "Buhari Talks Tough, Says Suppliers of Substandard Fuel would be Held Accountable",
          "text": "*Directs service providers to give information on consumed products\n\n*House wants companies involved suspended\n\n*Emadeb Consortium fights back, says NNPC\u2019s claims misleading\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Vanessa Obioha\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said suppliers of the methanol-blended petroleum products in the country were liable for the bad fuel and should be held accountable. Buhari directed relevant government agencies to take every lawful step to ensure the respect and protection of consumers against market abuse and social injustice.\n\nThe president was reacting to the saga of the adulterated petrol imported into the country, which was said to have damaged some vehicles. The withdrawal of the fuel is behind the recent petrol scarcity that has caused long fuel queues in some towns and cities across Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari said the protection of consumer interests was the priority of his administration. He said his government was ready to take necessary measures to protect consumers from hazardous products, loss or injuries from the consumption of substandard goods.\n\nThe president directed that in line with the law, service providers must make full disclosure of relevant information with respect to the consumption of their products. He said dissatisfied consumers were entitled to proper redress of their complaints.\n\nHowever, following the disclosure by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) that its investigation revealed the presence of methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil, the House of Representatives yesterday directed the national oil company to suspend the companies involved.\n\nThat was as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), also yesterday, called for an independent inquest into the matter. The main opposition party alleged that the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) was trying to provide cover for some of its leaders, reportedly, involved in importation of the bad fuel.\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) also said NNPC, as the sole importer of fuel in the country, should be responsible for payment of damages to affected Nigerians.\n\nBut Emadeb-consortium yesterday distanced itself from the bad fuel saga, saying listing it among those partly responsible for the importation of the off-specification petrol by the NNPC is misleading. The group in a statement in Abuja released by the Lead Consortium, Emadeb Energy Services Limited, urged NNPC to single out Brittania-U, an initial member of the coalition, which opted out of the arrangement instead of lump everyone in the consortium together.\n\nThe House of Representatives also mandated its committee on petroleum downstream to investigate the release of adulterated petroleum in the country with a view to ensuring that the culprits were brought to book and recommendations made to avoid future reoccurrence.\n\nThe Downstream Committee of the House was also mandated to ascertain whether the importation, distribution and dispensing of the toxic petrol in Nigeria till date conformed to the international standard.\n\nMembers of the committee where further mandated to find out the roles played, if any, by NNPC, the Standard Organisation of Nigeria, the Directorate of Petroleum Resources, Nigerian Navy, Customs, limited liability companies, and, perhaps, individuals in respect of the incident and report back to the House within four weeks for further legislative action.\n\nThe resolutions were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance, sponsored by Chief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno (APC, Borno).\n\nMonguno, moving the motion, noted that the country recently witnessed scarcity of fuel in petrol stations, especially in the Federal Capital Territory and Lagos State, due to the withdrawal of fuel with high methanol content. He said the House was aware that the fuel quality was noticed about a week ago when car engines of a lot of motorists were, reportedly, damaged and consumers had already started suing retail outlets for selling the adulterated fuel.\n\nMonguno lamented that as a result of actions or inactions over the years, Nigeria, known to be a petroleum producing country, has now outsourced the refining of petroleum products to jurisdictions outside the country.\n\nWhile noting that the situation was embarrassing, the chief whip said the incident further reinforced the widespread clamour that petroleum government refineries in the country should be revamped so that the ugly scenario won\u2019t happen again.\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Magaji Da\u2019u (APC, Jigawa) was of the view that for the incident to happen, it meant the system was compromised, stressing that \u201cheads will roll.\u201d\n\nDeputy Minority Leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu (PDP, Enugu) said it appeared the parliament had been hired by NNPC to work for it.\n\nOn her part, Hon. Taiwo Oluga (APC, Osun), wondered what NNPC had done since the matter was reported.\n\nAnother lawmaker, Hon. Mshelia Haruna (APC, Borno), advised that citizens whose vehicles were affected should be considered during the investigation and recommendations.\n\nPDP Demands Independent Inquest\n\nPDP demanded investigation into allegations that APC leaders connived with foreign interests to import the fuel laden with methanol, \u201cin their desperation to defraud Nigerians and corruptly raise billions of naira to fund the APC National Convention and rigging of the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nThe main opposition party further alleged that with President Muhammadu Buhari as Minister of Petroleum, it would be impossible to achieve results without an independent inquest, else it would end like the #EndSARS inquiry.\n\nIn a statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, the party said it was now clear that APC leaders were desperately seeking ways to steal money to fund their 2023 rigging scheme, \u201csince the PDP and well-meaning Nigerians exposed and challenged their plots to siphon a staggering N2.557 trillion padded as fuel subsidy for 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPDP strongly condemned these despicable acts by APC leaders, which further expose the impunity and wickedness of the APC towards Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe inclination for official concealment ostensibly informed the refusal by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, on national television on Wednesday, February 9, 2022, to name those involved in the importation of the poisonous fuel into our country.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, the PDP rejects the announced internal investigation of this terrible crime by the government, as the APC administration cannot be trusted, given its manifest predilection to shield the APC leaders involved.\n\n\u201cNigerians note the various investigations instituted by the APC government in the past, which ended without any meaningful outcome; notable among which was the manipulated EndSARS Report.\u201d\n\nThe PDP demanded, \u201cAn Independent Commission of Enquiry to investigate all issues connected to the APC toxic fuel importgate.\u201d It maintained that those involved must be exposed and held accountable.\n\nIt further stated, \u201cOur party insists that President Muhammadu Buhari, as the Minister of Petroleum Resources, cannot acquit himself with his reported comedy of anger, buck-passing, querying of subordinates and attempt by government to use some companies as scapegoats instead of accepting responsibility by exposing and naming individuals involved in the crime.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the APC must explain how the reported 317 million litres of toxic fuel came into our country, got cleared and distributed across the nation to worsen the life-discounting experiences of millions of Nigerians under the APC administration.\n\n\u201cApart from the consequential economic hardship occasioned by the damaging of cars and equipment, crippling of means of livelihood across the country, as well as increase in the cost of food items and essential services, the cascading effect of adulterated fuel on our aviation industry can only be imagined.\n\n\u201cSadly, the situation has the possibility to trigger loss of confidence by international airlines in our aviation fuel supply with attendant economic downturn as they would more likely prefer to fuel in neighbouring countries.\u201d\n\nNNPC Responsible for Payment of Damages to Affected Nigerians, Says IPMAN\n\nSecretary of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Ismail Osatuyi, who spoke yesterday, while featuring on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Arise News Channel, said the NNPC and its agents must go back to the drawing board and make sure things were done well.\n\nOsatuyi stated, \u201cif you are cooking a soup and you put too much salt, definitely you can\u2019t eat it. This is the scenario we are seeing now.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigerians whose cars were destroyed by the product had rights to take legal action.\n\nOsatuyi added, \u201cThe buyers \u2013 Nigerians that had their vehicles spoiled \u2013 have the right to take legal action. And we have told our members that we have to know who and who are affected, which stations, which companies, so that we can also pass the information to the government.\n\n\u201cSince we are not responsible for the importation, then there must be restitution and that is the fact. And the government has to come in this time around for them to mitigate whatever damage they have done to the vehicle of Nigerians\u2019 and individuals.\u201d\n\nAsked if IPMAN would sue NNPC or its agents, Osatuyi stressed that the association would rather engage NNPC in dialogue.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWe are not going to sue the government on this issue, but we are going to collate data of affected stations and what it could cost us and pass it to the authority.\n\n\u201cWe are going to engage in dialogue so that we don\u2019t add to the problem. This has already happened and they are trying to mitigate the problem.\u201d\n\nOsatuyi pointed out that if the country\u2019s four refineries were working, such an issue would not have occurred.\n\nAsked if he was confident that NNPC would reimburse IPMAN members in anyway or bear the cost, Osatuyi said the government agency had no choice than to compensate them, otherwise the association would take legal action.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThey have no choice this time around. These are facts and figures. It is only when we engage them in discussion and say these are the figures, these are the facts, and they are trying to be funny, then we can now look at what we can do within the ambit of the law.\u201d\n\nEmadeb Denies Involvement, Says Brittania-U Should Be Held Responsible\n\nEmadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi stated that in several communications, it had notified NNPC of the decision of Brittania-U not to abide by the consortium\u2019s agreement, leading to deal that other members would not be liable for damages incurred by the company in the course of operations.\n\nThe consortium stated that NNPC was aware of the refusal of Brittania-U to cooperate with other members by way of making information available when needed.\n\nThe Emadeb statement stressed that the information released by NNPC did not exactly represent what transpired.\n\nIt stated, \u201cWe refer to the press release of February 9, 2022 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited on the issue of contaminated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) with higher concentrates of methanol, allegedly, imported by Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium.\n\n\u201cWe hereby state that the said importation of the contaminated PMS was executed by a member of the consortium, to wit: Brittania-U.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the blanket claims made against the consortium by the NNPC are misleading and contradict the actual events that happened; they do not fully reflect and/or represent what transpired.\u201d\n\nThe consortium stated that the clarifications relating to the delivery of the said contaminated petrol to the country were necessary to protect their image, as they had invested a lot in building each member\u2019s respective brands in the industry.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cBrittania-U Nigeria Limited (Brittania-U) was the sole supplier of the 90,000MT of PMS delivered via MT Torm Hilde with laycan January 2 to 4, 2022.\n\n\u201cAt the formation of the consortium in May 2021 by NNPC, Brittania-U refused to execute the Service and Consortium Agreement submitted to NNPC in fulfilment of the award of the DSDP contract.\u201d\n\nEmadeb stated that as the lead of the consortium, it engaged Brittania-U severally and the company insisted on dealing with NNPC independently of which the national oil company was expressly notified via a letter dated June 2, 2021.\n\nFurther, the consortium stated that Brittania-U vehemently refused to execute the Consortium Agreement with the other consortium members \u2013 Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi- saying it became surprising and frustrating to everyone.\n\nIt stated, \u201cBrittania-U communicated all her actions to the other consortium members and NNPC harping on the following points: Brittania-U\u2019s preference to perform a sole contract for crude lifting and PMS supply under the DSDP arrangement.\n\n\u201cBrittania-U\u2019s choice to be solely liable under her supplies to NNPC and in the light of which she indemnified the other consortium members accordingly.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the alleged culprit further refused the nominated international partner agreed by other consortium members \u2013 Emadeb/Hyde/ Ay Maikifi.\n\nEmadeb stated that Brittania-U failed to cooperate or share information and documents with the other consortium members in respect of the December 2021 crude cargo allocated to her by NNPC.\n\nIt further stated that following the repeated refusal of Brittania-U to work with the consortium, it indemnified the other consortium members\u2013Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi and the resulting agreement was executed by their company on June 16, 2021.\n\nThe indemnity clause, the consortium said, covered Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi against all damages, losses, costs and expenses.\n\nIt noted that this also included reasonable legal costs, expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees and liabilities incident to claims, demands or causes of action brought by or on behalf of any person or entity as result of the performance of or failure to perform the project.\n\n\u201cThe indemnity also covers shortages in delivery of products, late deliveries, delivery of off-spec cargo or other wrongful performance of their obligations in the DSDP agreement,\u201d Emadeb insisted.\n\nThe consortium via a letter dated December 10, 2021 said it informed NNPC of non-receipt of information from Brittania-U on all correspondence relating to the DSDP crude cargo allocated to them.\n\nIn addition, it said that it stated that Brittania-U\u2019s action contradicted all efforts to ensure performance on her allotted crude cargo.\n\nThe statement sad, \u201cIn view of the notice of the contaminated product, Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi immediately notified Brittania-U via a letter dated February 3, 2022 and also expressly informed NNPC of the sole liability of Brittania U.\n\n\u201cBased on the substantial evidence provided to NNPC and several declarations by Brittania-U to NNPC, Brittania-U is therefore solely liable for the supply of the PMS via MT Torm Hilde.\n\n\u201cThis is also demonstrated by their unwillingness to be part of the consortium; however, all the other parties were duly indemnified by Brittania-U.\n\n\u201cThe other consortium members \u2013 Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi had performed and delivered 270,000MT of PMS in the last five months and they were certified by the NNPC-nominated inspector without any complaint or adverse issues.\n\n\u201cOut of the 270,000MT of PMS, 90,000MT is currently discharging via MT Fair Seas offshore Lagos. All records showing our performance are available with NNPC for verification and validation.\u201d\n\nThe consortium stated that it would continue to work with NNPC and perform creditably on all its obligations, positing that as reputable companies, they will not associate themselves with any activity that will be to the detriment of the citizens of the country.\n\nIt said, \u201cEmadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi believe that these stated positions of ours have demonstrated that we are not the suppliers of the said contaminated PMS.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to give our full and maximum cooperation to any government investigation panel and or any agency with all the relevant documentation and or information that maybe required.\n\n\u201cWe implore all our customers to continue to patronise all services provided by Emadeb/Hyde and Ay Maikifi.\u201d\n\nOando Denies Involvement in Saga\n\nOando issued a rejoinder denying involvement in the methanol petrol affair. Company Secretary, Ayotola Jagun, signed the response, dated February 10.\n\nIt stated, \u201cFollowing media reports listing Oando as one of four importers that supplied methanol-blended Premium Motor Spirits (PMS) into the country, we hereby state that Oando did not import and supply PMS that was adulterated or substandard.

          "title": "IMF: Nigeria\u2019s Debt Sustainability at Risk, Cause for Concern",
          "text": "Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability is at risk and causes a great deal of concern and unease in the long-term. IMF reiterated the need for the Nigeria government to implement timely fiscal reforms.\n\nIMF\u2019s Mission Chief for Nigeria, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, said these yesterday, during a virtual media briefing on its Nigeria\u2019s 2021 Article IV Consultation Staff Report.\n\nRahman noted that the increase in public debt had grown rapidly in 10 years and was approaching a time when the country would spend all its income on servicing debts. She stressed the need for urgent fiscal reforms.\n\nRahman explained, \u201cBut what we should remember here and the things that make Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability at risk are the following: we have seen a rapid rise in public debt in the last 10 years or so and this is being driven by fiscal deficits.\n\n\u201cSo, the dynamics is not that great. And there are a couple of other points that we should remember; which is that Nigeria\u2019s debt carrying capacity is very low. For us, revenue levels are low comparing to a typical emerging market country that spends less than 10 per cent of revenues on interest payments.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria\u2019s case, that ratio, if you just take federal government, it\u2019s over 80 per cent of revenues, if you take the consolidated, it is around a third, but the federal government is responsible for paying this debt service. So that\u2019s one point.\n\n\u201cThe second point is on the access side. Market access for Nigeria, that is international market access, like Eurobond, etc., is highly dependent on what happens to oil prices, more so than some other commodity exporters and oil exporters. So that makes Nigeria quite vulnerable.\u201d\n\nRahman said going forward, IMF projected for Nigeria a continuous increase in public debt.\n\n\u201cSo, we are projecting you will see public debt to go up from 36 per cent of GDP to close to 43 per cent of GDP in the medium term,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, it is increasing and it is reaching that level where you should be concerned, everybody should be concerned,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cNigeria has favourable dynamics in the sense that high inflation and low interest rates are keeping these dynamics in favour of Nigeria, right. But if that were to change because growth rates are not high, you could see public debt growing up very fast.\u201d\n\nResponding to a THISDAY inquiry on the impact fuel subsidy removal and value added tax (VAT) would have the masses, Rahman explained that tax reforms were a necessity to boost the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nShe also restated the need for the federal government to remove fuel subsidy, saying it is costly and regressive.\n\nRahman stated, \u201cA country that has little fiscal space to have a subsidy that benefits mostly the rich doesn\u2019t make sense. So, there are economic and social grounds for removing this subsidy.\n\n\u201cOf course, will it impact the poor because it\u2019s a universal subsidy it affects the poor, too. So, removing subsidy would have impact on poverty.\u201d\n\nThe IMF official added, \u201cAnd if you look at Nigeria\u2019s past attempts to remove fuel subsidies, it has always been difficult. But it would be important that in addition to having social assistance, targeted social assistance for the vulnerable and the poor and it also will need strong political will and a well-designed public campaign to demonstrate the merits of this reform and a full transparency in the use of resources. Without this important reform there is risk of reversal again.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Again, apex bank extends 5% concessionary interest on intervention loans by one year\n\n*Plans to end FX sale to banks by year-end\n\n* Diaspora remittances improve to $100m weekly\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday announced a new programme to stimulate the country\u2019s non-oil exports and achieve $200 billion repatriation of proceeds between three to five years.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme, code-named, \u201cRace to $200 billion in FX Repatriation (RT200 FX Programme),\u201d which takes immediate effect, consists of a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports which would help the country attain its goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports transactions over the next three to five years.\n\nHe added that the initiative was a product of consultation with the banking community.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of the 364th meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee in Abuja, the CBN governor also announced further extension of all the central bank\u2019s concessionary five per cent interest rate on its intervention facilities till March 1, 2023.\n\nThe CBN had in January 2021, approved an extension on all its facilities by 12 months to March 2022, from the earlier March 2021 expiration date, against the backdrop of the dangers posed by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic businesses.\n\nThe concessions were provided during the first wave of the pandemic as part of measures to cushion its impact on businesses and economy.\n\nThis was as Emefiele further hinted that the central bank may end the sale of FX to banks for the purpose of funding their export bills, adding that the banks would be rather encouraged to generate their export revenue and proceeds.\n\nHe, however, explained that the new non-oil export initiative would have five key anchors namely value-adding exports facility; Non-oil commodities\u2019 expansion facility; Non-oil FX rebate scheme; Dedicated non-oil export terminal as well as Biannual non-oil export summit.\n\nEssentially, he said the new FX drive was informed by the inadequacy in FX supply and constant pressure on the exchange rate, pointing out that the country\u2019s four major sources of FX inflow namely: proceeds from oil exports, proceeds from non-oil exports, diaspora remittances, and foreign direct/portfolio investments had been constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe the lessons we have learnt from our policies on remittances can be applied in improving some aspects of FX inflow into the country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further argued that most of the sources of FX inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, we need to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange. We would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.\u201d\n\nHe said though the $200 billion FX proceeds target appeared unattainable to some, \u201cBut I am resolute and determined that we can achieve it.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor added: \u201cMany countries that are much less endowed than Nigeria are doing it. Consider for example that agriculture exports alone from the Netherlands was about $120 billion last year.\n\n\u201cYet, Netherlands has a land mass of about 42,000 square kilometers, which is much smaller than the land mass of Niger State alone, at over 76,000 square kilometers.\u201d\n\nHe said while the RT200 Programme was not intended to be a silver bullet to all the challenges in the export segment, it remained a first step meant to ensure that the CBN was able to carry out its mandate in an effective and efficient manner, which guarantees preservation of the scarce commonwealth, and the stability of the naira.\n\nEmefiele insisted that, \u201cIt is only by boosting productive and earning capacity of this economy that we can truly preserve the long-term value of our currency, as well as the stability of our exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele, while justifying the extension of the concessionary loans, said the impact of the intervention measures helped the country make the fastest recovery from recession ever recorded and changed the trajectory of inflation to an eight-month downward spiral.\n\nHe noted that although interest rates on the CBN\u2019s various intervention facilities were expected to revert to nine per cent effective March 1, 2022, it has been extended to March, 2023.\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cWe are announcing that the rates would remain at five per cent for another year in view of the promising trajectory we have established in economic growth and job creation. In effect, the concessionary interest rate of five per cent on our intervention facilities would now be extended until March 1, 2023.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed that the policies and measures adopted by the bank led to a significant improvement in diaspora inflow from an average of $6 million per week in December 2020, to an average of over $100 million per week by January 2022.\n\nCommenting further on plans by the central bank to limit FX sales to banks for exports activities, Emefiele said: \u201cThe banks don\u2019t have a choice, and I said so this morning in the meeting,\n\n\u201cI said the era is coming to an end because when your customers need $100 million, $200 million foreign exchange demand, and so you want to pack all the dollar and pass it to CBN to give you dollar \u2013 that era is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cI have told them at the meeting before, that latest end of this year, we would tell them don\u2019t call the central bank for FX again, rather go and generate your export revenue and proceeds.\n\n\u201cFund people who want to generate export proceeds, when those export proceeds come, we would fund them at five per cent for you and they would earn rebate and that\u2019s how we can help you.\n\n\u201cThen, when these proceeds come, sell them to your customers that want $100 million or $200 million. That you will continue to come to central bank to give you dollar, we would stop it. The banks don\u2019t have a choice because it is their bread and butter, right?\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Conveners of a meeting of 100 leading business, political, civil society, and thought leaders, which held last week in Lagos, yesterday explained that the gathering should not be linked to the 2023 presidential election but a platform to chat a new consensus for national rebirth.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the coordinators of the group, Chairman of THISDAY/Arise Media Group, Nduka Obaigbena, and former Presidential Liaison Officer to the Senate, Kashim Imam, the eminent persons noted that the gathering was meant to build consensus towards national rebirth.\n\nThe meeting, which held from February 4 to 6 under the aegis of \u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d, the conveners pointed out, remained non- partisan. They said the retreat to chart a new consensus for national rebirth was attended by 14 incumbent governors, 13 former governors, and three former senate presidents.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d conveners stated, \u201cWhilst the 2022 committee is interested in the quality of leadership that will emerge in Nigeria at all levels, we consider attempts to link the committee with candidates or political parties for the 2023 elections as an unwarranted and unnecessary distraction. Candidates are only chosen by political parties and we are not a political party.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the group stressed that participants, working in three sub-committees, namely: national security, the economy, and Nigeria in transition, recognised that there was an urgent need to seek common ground and irreducible minimum actions to stabilise the polity at this critical time of transition.\n\nThe statement came against the backdrop of speculations that the well-attended event was to select a presidential candidate among the attendees.\n\nBut the coordinators of the meeting stated that although all the 100 leading lights of the 2022 committee had the capacity for national leadership, it should not be linked to the politics of 2023.\n\nThe conveners said among the active participants in the work of the committee were over seven persons, from three or more political parties, who had already publicly declared their aspirations to lead the country but were desirous of working with other patriots for non-partisan greater national goals.\n\n\u201cWe must have a secure, peaceful and united nation before we can have candidates for political offices,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement further said the committee was of the view that what Nigeria needed today was for all patriots to come together to rescue the country from all political, economic and security threats, and promote the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe meetings will continue as we work with federal and state governments, current and future political leaders of all political persuasions, as well as other eminent patriotic citizens, for the greater good of the Nigerian people,\u201d the group maintained.\n\nThe group of eminent Nigerians called on all patriotic volunteers, willing and able, to join the collective effort to stabilise the country so that a new Nigeria that all could be proud of, could be built.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Explains why inspectors did not detect bad petrol before circulation\n\n\u2022National oil company requests emergency supply\n\n\u2022NMDPRA says nation has 10-day reserve deficit, announces arrival of 300m litres of fuel\n\n\u2022Assures queues to disappear by Friday\n\n\u2022FG orders investigation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian National Company Limited (NNPC) yesterday stated that its investigation has revealed the presence of Methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil.\n\nGroup Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, who disclosed this during a media briefing yesterday, however said he has since ordered the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\nIt was also gathered yesterday that the NNPC has asked oil trading firms to embark on emergency supply of petrol to replace cargoes that were rejected because of their poor quality, Reuters quoted two sources as having disclosed yesterday.\n\nApparently disturbed by the development, the federal government yesterday ordered investigation into the bad fuel that had damaged the engines of some vehicles.\n\nIn addition to disrupting the country\u2019s fuel supply chain, the product which led to the damage of several cars, the NNPC disclosed, was imported from Antwerp in Belgium.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja, Kyari, argued that petrol brought into Nigeria usually does not include the test for the level of methanol content.\n\nThe NNPC helmsman maintained that cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\n\u201cAs a standard practice for all PMS import to Nigeria, the cargoes were equally certified by inspection agent appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has met Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and our discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for per cent of methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari disclosed that the NNPC had ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel that led to the disruption of the petrol distribution value chain, in order to prevent further distribution.\n\nHe stressed that the NNPC and other stakeholders were making serious efforts to resolve issues generated by the supply and discharge of methanol blended product in some Nigerian depots.\n\nKyari noted that the NNPC first received a report on January 20, 2022, from its quality inspector of the presence of \u201cemulsion particles\u201d in petrol cargoes shipped to Nigeria from the European country.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn order to prevent the distribution of the petrol, we have ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes and the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\n\u201cAll defaulting suppliers have been put on notice for remedial actions and NNPC will work with the authority to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\n\u201cNNPC wishes to reassure Nigerians that we are currently sourcing additional cargoes to ensure product sufficiency.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC has ordered that all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine), should be withheld.\n\nBut the NNPC GMD\u2019s explanation ran contrary to an earlier press statement released by MRS, where the company denied culpability.\n\nIn its statement MRS had stated that it remains a responsible corporate citizen and will not be involved in the purchase, importation, distribution or marketing of substandard petroleum products in the country, coming short of directly accusing the NNPC of complicity.\n\n\u201cDue to current subsidy regime, NNPC is the sole supplier of all PMS in Nigeria. Consequently, the NNPC through their trading arm Duke Oil, supplied a cargo of PMS purchased from international trader Litasco and delivered it with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. This vessel discharged in Apapa between the 24th and 30th of January, 2022,\u201d it had alleged.\n\nAs one of the beneficiaries, MRS said it received the product in its depot and distributed the product to only eight of its stations in Lagos.\n\nThe company described the allegation trending at the time as mischievous, false and untrue.\n\nBut the NNPC boss maintained that the methanol blended petrol was imported into the country by the suppliers, including MRS, through its Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase arrangement.\n\nThe arrangement allows the national oil company to deliver monthly crude oil lifting on Free on Board (FOB) basis to suppliers who in return are supposed to deliver petroleum products of Nigerian standard specification to NNPC.\n\nThe petroleum products delivered are usually equivalent in value to the crude oil received from NNPC subject to the general terms and conditions as advised.\n\nBut according to the NNPC, the companies that supplied the methanol blended petrol included MRS which made the importation through a vessel named MT Bow Pioneer.\n\nHe said while Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium brought in the fuel through a vessel identified as MT Tom Hilde, Oando allegedly brought in the product through a vessel named MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil came through MT Nord Gainer vessel.\n\nFuel queues had been building in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, due to fuel shortages caused by the withdrawal of the contaminated petrol from the market. But NNPC was said to be seeking thousands of tonnes of the product to ameliorate the situation, the report said.\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had said it found fuel with methanol above national specifications in the supply chain and removed the fuel from circulation. Although methanol, in small amounts, is a regular gasoline additive, the regulator said the supplier of the off-specification gasoline was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNigeria depends almost entirely on imports to meet its domestic fuel needs after many failed attempts to revamp the dilapidated refineries, with daily consumption exceeding 60 million litres.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortium receives 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total about 320,000 bpd of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nNigerians feel that cheap fuel is one of the few benefits the average Nigerian gets from the government, which sets price caps at the pump through a controversial and patchy subsidy scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, yesterday stated that NNPC had received delivery of 300 million litres of petrol to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos, when he met with marketers in a bid to raise distribution and remove the substandard fuel from supply chain, Ahmed said the 300 million litres arrived through six vessels ordered by NNPC. He noted that with the latest delivery, the fuel queues being witnessed in the country should disappear by Friday.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cToday, I am happy to say that loading has been going on in most of the depots because we have been able to identify, isolate and quarantine the limited amount of gasoline that was affected by the methanol volume that was discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have vessels that have arrived in the country recently. At least six arrived in the last few days, ordered by the NNPC, carrying a total volume of close to 300 million litres, just to close the gap created by those vessels we have withdrawn from the system.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Ahmed disclosed that there was a 9,000-metric tonne vessel that was being discharged at the Apapa Port to major marketers, including OVH, TotalEnergies, 11 Plc, Conoil, and Ardova Plc.\n\nAccording to him, as soon as the vessels complete discharging and start pushing products to oil marketers, the fuel queues in Lagos should fully disappear by Friday.\n\n\u201cSo, once these vessels complete discharging and start pushing the products to marketers, I believe Lagos will be cleared by Friday,\u201d Ahmed stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have got that assurance from the marketers. Also, most of these vessels will be providing volumes to most of the key members of DAPPMAN.\u201d\n\nBut the NMDPRA boss stated that the country currently had petrol that could last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur ideal days of sufficiency is 30 but this happened because of the concern that made us withdraw the vessels, which created the gap in our 30 days sufficiency.\n\n\u201cAgain, with aggressive importation by the NNPC, this will be closed in a few days, according to the data we got from the NNPC\u2019s import programme.\n\n\u201cLoading is also on-going in most of the depots that have confirmed spec products; so, there is no need for panic. Hopefully, by tomorrow, Lagos will be cleared.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory agency said it was also working to address the challenge thrown up by the importation of substandard petrol into the country.\n\nOther attendees at the meeting included top officials of NNPC, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), and members of the Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN).\n\nFG Orders Investigation\n\nBriefing newsmen at Abuja, after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said government had initiated moves to investigate the supply and circulation of adulterated petrol in the country. Sylva said the federal government wanted to get to the root of the matter, and warned against hasty conclusions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to draw any conclusions yet,\u201d the former Bayelsa State governor said. \u201cThere will be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let us really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister assured that the government would consider compensating those who might have been adversely affected by the bad fuel.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation,\u201d he stated.\n\nAsked whether the issue was discussed at the FEC meeting and whether the suppliers would be punished, Sylva said, \u201cThe issue did not come up in council, but, of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it.\n\n\u201cNobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and the NNPC is up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to the NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we are actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.\u201d\n\nMRS had in a newspaper advertorial yesterday said Duke Oil supplied a cargo of the adulterated petrol, which it purchased from an international trader, Litasco, and delivered with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. MRS further stated the vessel was discharged in Apapa, Lagos, between January 24 and 30, 2022, explaining that major marketers received the following quantities: OVH \u2013 10,000mt; MRS \u2013 5,000mt; NIPCO \u2013 5,958mt; ARDOVA \u2013 6,000mt; and TOTAL \u2013 10,000mt\n\nSylva also spoke on the approval granted to his ministry by the council, saying FEC okayed the contract for the construction of the 17-storey local content building in Yenagoa at the cost of N1.817 billion.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that in 2020, Mr. President already commissioned that project. There were some ancillary works that had to be done to connect some of the buildings and that was now presented to council for the sum of N1.817 billion and this now closes out this contract and we have told the contractor. This is the full and final payment for everything.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the end of this project and we have completely delivered this to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) engaged the services of the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP) to ensure uninterrupted distribution of petroleum products and maintain sanity in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIPMAN President, Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo, who disclosed this to journalists yesterday said the strategy would weaken the threat by the National Association of Transport Owners (NARTO), which recently issued a threat to embark on industrial action.\n\nOkoronkwo said IPMAN was not part of any trade association and would not embark on industrial action to further compound the predicament faced by Nigerians. He said members were already heavily indebted to banks and could not afford to stagnate their businesses, adding that already, many have shut down operations as a result of harsh operating environment.\n\nThe president said IPMAN was ready to confront the excesses of the NARTO and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), who he alleged illegally fleeced marketers.\n\nOkoronkwo stated, \u201cThey are not registered under oil and gas, but as dry dock. But today they are gradually redefining operations of marketers who have signed bulk purchase arrangement with the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe have lost over N27 billion over time from illegal fees they collect from marketers. They collect about N45,000 per truck and taking in millions that ought to be part of our margins and are building stations and purchasing trucks at the expense of duly licensed marketers.\u201d\n\nOkoronkwo raised concern about the dwindling margins of marketers and the heavy debts hanging on the necks of IPMAN members.\n\n\u201cThe products we purchased with N1 million in the past is now about N7 million without additional margin to operators,\u201d he said.\n\nNARTO had threatened to stop haulage of petroleum products across the country over the hike in the price of diesel to N430 per litre and other operational challenges. The association had earlier decried the delay in the payment of about N45 billion bridging cost, and demanded an increase in the transportation allowance factored into the pump price of petrol.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house. That idea is erroneous and unfortunately many young people in Nigeria today are falling for it.\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways out of this problem is for government to create jobs for youths across the country to get them productively engaged. A lot of them are idle and that is why the desire to make quick money is rampant among them.\n\n\n\n\"It is very sad how we have come to this point where people just kill another human because they want to be rich. It is sad,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSpokespersons for the police in Abia and Anambra states, Geoffrey Ogbonna and Ikenga Tochukwu, when contacted by SaharaReporters on Thursday, said that the cases will be looked into and appropriate measures would be taken to tackle the menace.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives called for the declaration of a national emergency of the rising cases of ritual killings across Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMinority Leader of the House, Mr Toby Okechukwu, moved the motion during plenary at the lower chamber of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHe and his colleagues urged the National Orientation Agency and other stakeholders in the society to embark on vigorous campaigns to open the eyes of members of the public especially youths to the evils of ritual killings for money.\n\n\n\nBut according to a Lagos-based sociologist, Nike Adetutu, tackling this dangerous trend in Nigeria will also require the return to core morals and values in society.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, training and monitoring at the family level has broken down and that is why there are young people with misplaced priorities and poor orientation everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"We must go back to the family system, where everything starts, we have failed in that area as a society.\n\n\n\n\"Parents are no longer giving the right training and monitoring to their children and that is why many of them have gone astray.\n\n\n\n\"The return to core morals and values will save us from all these problems. If we don't act fast, we may not be able to handle the disaster already looming,\" she said.",

          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house. That idea is erroneous and unfortunately many young people in Nigeria today are falling for it.\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways out of this problem is for government to create jobs for youths across the country to get them productively engaged. A lot of them are idle and that is why the desire to make quick money is rampant among them.\n\n\n\n\"It is very sad how we have come to this point where people just kill another human because they want to be rich. It is sad,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSpokespersons for the police in Abia and Anambra states, Geoffrey Ogbonna and Ikenga Tochukwu, when contacted by SaharaReporters on Thursday, said that the cases will be looked into and appropriate measures would be taken to tackle the menace.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives called for the declaration of a national emergency of the rising cases of ritual killings across Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMinority Leader of the House, Mr Toby Okechukwu, moved the motion during plenary at the lower chamber of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHe and his colleagues urged the National Orientation Agency and other stakeholders in the society to embark on vigorous campaigns to open the eyes of members of the public especially youths to the evils of ritual killings for money.\n\n\n\nBut according to a Lagos-based sociologist, Nike Adetutu, tackling this dangerous trend in Nigeria will also require the return to core morals and values in society.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, training and monitoring at the family level has broken down and that is why there are young people with misplaced priorities and poor orientation everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"We must go back to the family system, where everything starts, we have failed in that area as a society.\n\n\n\n\"Parents are no longer giving the right training and monitoring to their children and that is why many of them have gone astray.\n\n\n\n\"The return to core morals and values will save us from all these problems. If we don't act fast, we may not be able to handle the disaster already looming,\" she said.",

          "text": "Nigeria has set in motion what could herald a new dawn for African tech startups as it moots the adoption of new listing rules to encourage tech companies to go public.\n\nThis story was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG) is going on a charm offensive to attract tech unicorns to the bourse, in part to resuscitate the market after a lull in new listings.\n\nIts pivot towards fintech firms underpins the coming of age of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2013 now a top destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nNXG is now setting up a NASDAQ-style board to consolidate on the fast-growing internet economy created by local tech firms.\n\nOlumide Bolumole, division head of stock exchange listing activities at NXG revealed that the bourse will make sweeping changes to make listing attractive to tech companies.\n\nHe singled out \u201cbreaking even\u201d, one of the current prerequisites for listing a firm at the bourse, asserting that this requirement was stymieing the growth potential of tech outfits.\n\nNGX demutualised in 2021, taking the company private in a move that it hopes will attract greater flows of foreign and domestic investment into Nigeria\u2019s bourse, with a renewed emphasis on corporate governance and the ability to expand into other markets and sectors.\n\nNGX consists of a holding company and three subsidiaries that cover the operations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its regulation, and its real estate. This structure is similar to those of other international market groups such as the London, New York, and Johannesburg stock exchange groups.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria and a few other African states boast unicorns \u2013 startups that have attained a market valuation of over a billion US dollars and Africa is now home to seven: Jumia Technologies, Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, Wave, OPay, and Chipper Cash.\n\nFive of these became unicorns in 2021, including two in September alone, indicating the growing levels of interest in Africa\u2019s startup market not seen before.\n\nBut despite having the fourth-largest stock market in Africa none of Nigeria\u2019s home-grown top startups to date have been listed on the Lagos-based NSE. The proposed reforms should help tech firms tap into larger capital markets, starting at home.\n\nAccording to Wee Tracker (WT), the Nigerian government is in the process of implementing the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSE).\n\nIt will create a new regulatory framework that should allow innovation-driven businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe bill also intends to address prevalent shortcomings such as insufficient digital infrastructure, tax holidays, and capital access,\u201d WT said.\n\nListings for Africa\u2019s tech firms have many benefits, including fundraising and providing a seamless exit route to investors, supervision and control of trading in securities, and fair price for the securities.\n\nTimely disclosure of corporate information and better corporate practice are also some of the advantages of a company going public. Studies have also shown that consumers are often more willing to support listed firms.\n\nFor Nigeria, getting startups to list could help revive the country\u2019s bourse after a three-year listing drought. In recent decades, Nigeria\u2019s stock market capitalisation has fallen well below potential.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the market cap of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) swelled to $1.05 trillion, equivalent to 235% of the country\u2019s 301 billion US dollars GDP,\u201d according to Wee Tracker.\n\nWhile the NSE outperformed in 2020, growing by as much as 50 percent with 4.5 billion dollars in new listings, its market capitalisation of $56.6 billion \u2013 just 13.1% of the nation\u2019s comparatively enormous $432.3 billion GDP \u2013 shows there is considerable room for growth.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Valentine\u2019s is fast approaching and so is the race to win people\u2019s hearts with gifts. For many, the outcome of February 14 will decide if Christmas this year will be celebrated wearing matching pyjamas, or joining unnamed Zikoko team members blocking and muting words like \u201clove\u201d and \u201cme and mines\u201d later.\n\nFor Christmas, we gave you a guide to help you navigate gifting during the holiday season. Now we\u2019ve created this one to help you navigate Valentine\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, even gift-giving. If you\u2019re looking to steer clear of basic gifts like one-time food platters that will be consumed in single sittings, this is the guide for you. For example, James Wardle created a $1 million game\u2014Wordle\u2014for his partner who loved video games. Locket, an app that helps users share their photos to their friends\u2019/lovers\u2019 home screens, was built by Matt Moss as a present for his girlfriend. Even Zoom was the product of a founder who wanted to connect with his girlfriend long distance.\n\nLast year, the African tech ecosystem raised a whopping $4 billion+ so we know things are working. As we invest and build more startups, it\u2019s also important to invest and build relationships. And that\u2019s why you should move away from chocolates and roses to\u2026\n\n1. Professional courses\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nIf you can\u2019t build your partner apps The New York Times will later buy for millions of dollars, at least enrol them in courses where they can learn to build, design, market or manage those apps\u2014for themselves or future lovers. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThere are a few online schools where you can pay for courses like software engineering, design, product management, marketing, or content creation. Check out AltSchool, Moringa School, Decagon Institute, Coursera, and Pluralsight.\n\nYou should also sign them up for TC Daily, a daily newsletter that can give your lover comprehensive insight into tech.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about getting more people into tech. Use this Valentine\u2019s and help people kick-start their journey into tech.\n\nPrice range: > $99\n\nWe\u2019ve labelled this a Series C-type gift because it\u2019s a long-term investment beneficial to all involved. It\u2019s expensive but also profitable in the long run. Unless, of course, the giftee gets acquired by another gifter. \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: Stuff.tv\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nMusic heals our body, soul, and mind. It\u2019s also one of the greatest ways to connect with people. Over the past 5 years, the growth of streaming services\u2014indigenous and foreign\u2014has doubled.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, get your loved ones subscriptions on Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Boomplay.\n\nPrice range: $2 \u2013 $4 (for Individual plans)\n\nWe\u2019re labelling this a seed-type gift because, any way you dice it, you\u2019re sowing seeds. You\u2019re either sowing seeds of \u201cThis is how we chose our wedding songs\u201d, or breakfast seeds that will lead to many Adele playlists. Happy planting. \ud83c\udf31\n\n3. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: The Streamable\n\nEver heard of Netflix and Chill? Well, here\u2019s how you can someday build up to that: get them video streaming subscriptions for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription for Valentine\u2019s.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\nThis is also a seed-type gift because it\u2019s affordable and useful if things go sideways. Renewing the subscriptions marks the token of your shared love, and not renewing can be a new way to end the relationship, instead of ghosting.\n\n4. Data subscriptions\n\nLevel: Pre-seed\n\nData is life. And the more of it you have, the more you can access information available online. Data on the continent is still relatively expensive, and in some countries, people can pay as much as $7 for 1GB of data.\n\nAll the digital gifts we\u2019ve listed above are data-dependent so make sure you\u2019re getting your loved ones access to the gifts you give.\n\nWith data, people can stream as many movies and videos as they possibly can. Log on to your MTN, Safaricom, Airtel, or Ethio Telecom services and gift your loved one gigabytes of data.\n\nPrice range: From < $1\n\nThis is the only pre-seed gift here because you can decide how much or how little you want to invest here.\n\n5. Home services\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Yung Nollywood\n\nWhat\u2019s better than one-time food platters? Daily food packages that trump the time-consuming activity of cooking.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, and that includes automating home services like laundry and cooking.\n\nStartups like Eden Life have created platforms where you can subscribe to monthly packages for laundry, cooking and cleaning services. If you\u2019re going to go with the food option for Valentine\u2019s, then go all the way.\n\nPrice range: From $50\n\nThis is labelled Series C because it\u2019s also a long-term gift. Every time your loved one eats or steps into clean rooms and clothes, they\u2019ll think of you and how much you\u2019ve made their lives easier.\n\n6. Crypto\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Corporate Compliance Insights\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue. Crypto is here, and its promise is true.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to talk much about crypto. Like your relationships, it has its ups and downs, \ud83d\udc80 but that\u2019s what makes us love it.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, add to your loved one\u2019s crypto stash and help them build their way into digital wealth. There are many cryptocurrencies to choose from, like bitcoin, ethereum, and doge. And if you\u2019re worried about the chances of the coins depreciating, remember that even your relationship is a gamble.\n\nGet on BuyCoins, Yellow Card, Quidax, Nestcoin, or Bitsika to mine your way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nPrice range: From $1 (invest as required).\n\nThis is a Series C gift because it\u2019s long-term for both of you. If the relationship dips, you can take comfort in knowing that whenever crypto dips, so will your ex\u2019s happiness.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please give TechCabal a gift by sharing it on Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp or Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This developer transitioned to blockchain development in order to solve Web2 problems",
          "text": "Akinyemi Akindele, 27, studied computer science at the University of Ibadan, where he trained as a Web2 software developer.\n\nHowever, his journey into the blockchain world did not start until he got an internship in 2015 at Interswitch, one of Africa\u2019s earliest unicorns. At Interswitch, he worked in the research and development team where he got the opportunity to test out interesting emerging technologies like AI and blockchain\u2014technologies that the business was not focusing on at that point.\n\nAkindele was neck-deep into the blockchain and soon realised its power. \u201cPeople were talking about the future of finance and I got to work on it early on,\u201d Akindele said. As a Nigerian experiencing the rapid decline in value of the naira, Akindele resonated with bitcoin\u2019s promise to provide a store of value not tied to the traditional financial system or government\u2019s whims.\n\nHe was a man of varied interest, his final year paper at the university was based on artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014with a focus on artificial neural networks. Upon graduating from university, he returned to work at Interswitch and started learning how to develop blockchain solutions. Eventually, he got to build a blockchain supply chain solution with his team, the first of its kind in the country, he said. The blockchain solution made the loaning and contract awarding process involving Dangote Plc bidding suppliers and banks seamless.\n\nAkindele attended hackathons, and ethereum meetups organised by Consensys in Lagos, where he had to build smart contracts on ethereum. He won some\u2014worth 1 to 3 million naira\u2014and that was pivotal to his career growth. He admitted that he won a lot of those hackathons because he already had a lot of experience in building ethereum solutions at his workplace, Interswitch.\n\nIn one of the hackathons, he met an American founder, Daniel Block, who was building an NFT marketplace for properties, as far back as 2018. He was on a mission to tokenise real estate properties in Africa, had digitised land records in Ghana, and had his sights set on Nigeria.\n\nAkindele joined Block\u2019s company, SESO Global, as its first blockchain engineer, where he helped build an NFT marketplace. There, he spent a year building their enterprise ethereum, and wrote smart contract code to power those NFTs\u2014years before the NFT buzz of 2021.\n\nA rich blockchain development experience\n\nIt was in one of those hackathons, where he had been an outstanding competitor, that Akindele met Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin co-founder, who was then director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of global crypto exchange, Binance. Yele was a judge in those hackathons, and he kept in touch with Akindele because of his outstanding performance. So, when Yele needed a team to start a project internally inside Binance, he reached out to Akindele.\n\nAkindele joined Binance\u2014where he was earning about $48,000 per year\u2014as a blockchain engineer, and with a team of backend, mobile, and blockchain engineers, helped build a cryptocurrency exchange right from the scratch. \u201cIt was interesting because we got to learn a lot of new things. For example, I did a lot of encryption, wallet generation, and signing off; and I got to know a lot of different coins listed on the exchange.\u201d\n\nAkindele recalled that the project commenced when Facebook announced Libra, a cryptocurrency, wallet and an exchange, all in one. \u201cIt looked like the hottest thing ever!\u201d Akindele further explained that Binance was worried Facebook might take over developing countries due to the proposed Libra\u2019s reach, so Binance started a competing project, which gave birth to Bundle Africa.\n\nAt the time, Bundle Africa ran as a startup inside Binance and was also a remote-first company. Within 16 months, Bundle Africa got 650,000 users, majorly by word of mouth, community marketing, and a small marketing budget. The way its adoption skyrocketed made Akindele realise the huge potential crypto products had.\n\nAfter two years at Binance, Akindele joined EMTECH, a US blockchain company that builds digital currency for central banks across the world. At EMTECH\u2014where he was earning about $84, 000 per year\u2014he helped build tokens, did DevOps work and helped in shipping projects. EMTECH had created the world\u2019s first CBDC for the Bahamas and was the go-to fintech company for central banks looking to create digital currencies.\n\nBreaking into blockchain development\n\nAnother idea that endeared Akindele to blockchain engineering was that the blockchain was a melting point for a lot of things. \u201cTo be very good at blockchain you have to know things beyond your engineering skills, like finance, and compliance and regulations. You have to think about these things every time you write a code or develop anything.\u201d\n\nAkindele believes that anyone who wants to transition into becoming a Web3 developer must believe that it is the future. \u201cYou have to convince yourself because no one is coming to convince you that ownership rights on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be big in the future.\u201d\n\nHe further advised aspiring blockchain developers to learn how to build on a popular blockchain like ethereum, develop ethereum Decentralised applications (Dapps) and write Solidity code. \u201cIt is at this point you will realise that you have new powers because you would be able to write smart contracts, deploy them on a public blockchain and see people interacting with your blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolving problems with Web3\n\nAkindele left EMTECH to found a startup, BetDemand, a decentralised finance (DeFi) sport betting platform where every player who lose their bets still get their initial staking.\n\nThe idea for BetDemand came to him while he studied game theory to understand why and how people play games and the economic models designed as part of those games. He discovered that economic incentives in the traditional sports betting model are harmful: a large number of people were losing money but couldn\u2019t stop playing because they were already addicted to betting.\n\nBetDemand eliminates the major problem people have with betting: losing their money. \u201cImagine telling a punter that even if he loses, he will get his money back after a week. That is an irresistible offer,\u201d Akindele said. Players can only bet on football for now, with naira\u2014for as low as \u20a650\u2014and crypto.\n\nBetDemand gathers all the money staked by players in a single pool, introducing a lock-up period of 1 week, where players do not receive their money back until after a week. During this lock-up period, BetDemand converts this pool of funds to USDT, a stablecoin, which would then be deposited in Venus protocol, a DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The pool of funds then earns 12% to 15% annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n\u201cEverybody gets their money back at the end of the day, whether you win or lose, and the interest we get during the lock-up period is shared with the winners.\u201d\n\nAkindele explained that they could have opted for other coins that would raise their yield to as high as 30% but, right now, they are sticking with USDT because stablecoins are non-volatile. They make less profit but it\u2019s just enough to sustain the business.\n\nIn the last week of October, when BetDemand launched, the size of its pool of funds was $450; now it has increased to $26,000 per week.\n\nBetDemand calculates winnings by multiplying the amount that players bet by total odds\u2014a method not particularly different from how traditional betting companies calculate winnings. The day of the week in which one places a bet also affects winnings; it\u2019s called the \u201cday factor\u201d. The difference with BetDemand, however, is that payouts are based on the interest the pool of funds yields over the week, so players can\u2019t earn as high as they would with traditional betting. \u201cBut what we pay is enough to keep people coming back.\u201d\n\nLike the buzzy play-to-earn gaming Web3 companies, BetDemand is charting its course as a DeFi gaming company. And, although, yet to be announced, it has raised an angel round and is in the process of closing a pre-seed round.\n\nAkindele, speaking about what Web3 will do for Africa, said, \u201cWeb3 will be very big for Africa, because when the internet was being built in Silicon Valley, a lot of Africans did not participate in that. But we have a chance to do so now. Every time new technologies are built, a lot of wealth is created around that period, and people involved in building these technologies, or those that exist at the time, benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe advised developers hoping to start their blockchain engineering journey to join communities on Discord, connect with people, and ask questions, especially from founders, to see why they make the decisions they make. He also advised them to contribute to open source blockchain projects and look for ways to solve the problems that exist today in Web2 with Web3.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Bolt\u2019s plans for Africa after raising mega funding",
          "text": "In January, Bolt, one of the biggest ride-hailing startups in the world, closed a $711 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital and Fidelity and saw its valuation go up from $4.8 billion to about $8.4 billion.\n\nThe company said the new funds will be used to further improve its full suite of mobility and delivery products, and expand into new cities in Europe and Africa.\n\nTo understand Bolt\u2019s overarching plans for Africa, its second-largest market after Europe, TechCabal spoke with its Africa Regional Director, Paddy Partridge.\n\nEven though the company has added 2 new verticals\u2014shared cars and scooters, and quick commerce called Bolt Market\u2014to its product line, ride-hailing and food delivery services are the only products available in Africa. Rather than launch all its verticals in African cities, the company wants to continue ramping up more users for its ride-hailing and food delivery products\u2014at least for this year, as it introduces them to more African cities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nExpansion while meeting demands\n\nAccording to Partridge, the company is doubling down on its expansion plan in the North Africa region, as it currently only operates in Tunisia. Partridge also mentioned that more West African cities have been earmarked for expansion. However, expansion means more demands, and the company, like other players in the sector, is currently struggling to meet up.\n\nToday, the company boasts of over 40 million customers\u2014that\u2019s about 40% of its total users base\u2014and over 700,000 drivers in about 90 cities across 8 countries on the continent. A rough calculation puts the driver-to-rider ratio at 1:570. This is reported to be the reason for the occasional surge in trip prices, like the one observed in December last year. Prices had to be increased to attract more drivers to sign up and fill up the order.\n\nGoing forward, more drivers will be onboarded, so a surge in price wouldn\u2019t be the solution to meeting high demand. But the problem here is the lack of access to vehicles: thousands of drivers are willing to get on Bolt but don\u2019t own or have access to a vehicle to work with.\n\n\u201cThis is a major challenge, and to solve it, we\u2019re now doing several partnerships on the vehicle financing side,\u201d Partridge told TechCabal.\n\nThe company, which has a standing partnership with Nigeria\u2019s Sterling bank, has added Nigeria\u2019s MAX.ng, a logistics and vehicular asset financing startup, to the list of partners to provide financing for 10,000 affordable vehicles to their drivers. The company is also in partnership with FlexClub, a vehicle financing marketplace, to serve its drivers in South Africa.\n\n\u201cHopefully, it\u2019ll mean less surging, which I know is a challenge in the Nigerian market. And it\u2019ll mean that we can keep up with the growing demand,\u201d Partridge said.\n\nTransitioning to electronic mobility\n\nElectric mobility is the new trend, and every environment-conscious company is embracing the development. In Europe, Bolt says its fleets are filled with electric vehicles (EVs) and, as a result, all trips are carbon-neutral. Bolt\u2019s Green Plan is created to reduce its global ecological footprint. It says its e-scooters are all charged with 100% green energy and made from 100% recyclable materials. The company has begun to replicate that in Africa and is also planning to optimise for green this year.\n\n\u201cLast year, we introduced the green category in Nairobi. We also rolled out EVs for ride-hailing and food delivery in several markets. This year, we really want to start accelerating that,\u201d said Partridge. \u201cThis is important for two reasons: it is better for the environment and more profitable to drivers, particularly as fuel prices go up so rapidly.\u201d\n\nAs sweet as this development sounds, Partridge, unsurprisingly, said there is currently no plan to implement EVs in Nigeria. It\u2019s actually a no-brainer because Nigeria hasn\u2019t done a lot in the EV sector; there is no infrastructure to support EVs and, compared to other markets, they are not a wise economic option. This means MAX.ng, Bolt\u2019s financing partner, won\u2019t be extending EVs in its home country like it has done in other markets it operates in\u2014such as Egypt. \u201cThe main focus areas at this stage are really Kenya and South Africa.\u201d\n\nExtensive driver education and verification\n\nSix years ago in 2016\u2014about 3 years after it was founded in Estonia\u2014Bolt made its first foray into Africa when it launched in South Africa. It quickly expanded into Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria, and within 4 years, displaced Uber, its biggest competitor, to become the biggest ride-hailing platform in Africa.\n\nBut with huge growth comes equal responsibilities and challenges. Bolt\u2019s success in Africa came with a price. The startup has gone through an odd collection of good, bad, and ugly reviews from its African customers. Riders have reported being harassed by Bolt\u2019s drivers. For instance, during Nigeria\u2019s #ENDSARs protests, some Nigerians took to social media to complain and rant about how Bolt\u2019s drivers were delivering young people to the police. And this is one of many unpleasant experiences with the service.\n\nTo solve the problem, Partridge said the company is investing in building a more efficient verification system that will weed out bad players and shoot up the security rating of the platform. Though the process varies from market to market, depending on regulatory requirements, Bolt currently onboards drivers by checking identification and running criminal background checks.\n\nThe issue of onboarding only qualified well-behaved drivers on the platform may be a hard nut to crack because, when Bolt newly entered the African market, it was reported that the platform relaxed its entry requirement to snag market share from Uber\u2014a strategy that worked at the time but continues to haunt and hurt the brand today.\n\n\u201cSo, we have a new sort of quality management system that basically tracks different metrics and gives drivers more actionable feedback on how to improve their behavior on the platform,\u201d Partridge said. He also mentioned that Bolt is improving on their driver education programme, both online and offline.\n\nA safe space for women\n\nIt\u2019s said that women feel safer with other women than with men. This means that Bolt must onboard more female drivers. According to the African director, Bolt is looking to bring more women drivers onto the platform.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, across Africa, women make up a very small share of our driver base. But we see quite a big opportunity to get more of them into ride-hailing. And in South Africa and Kenya, we\u2019ve now launched women-only categories.\u201d\n\nThe women-only category is a feature that allows women to choose their rider to be a woman. \u201cThis is basically a way to give women a bit more trust on the platform, where they can choose if they want to pair with a woman rider.\u201d Similarly, women drivers, if they want to be paired with a woman rider, can choose that.\n\nOne could have sworn that the women\u2019s category would be rolled out in Nigeria immediately, given the many complaints from Nigerian women about harassment from male Bolt drivers. But that hasn\u2019t happened because, according to Patridge, South Africa and Kenya have the highest share of female drivers\u2014which is an essential metric in rolling out the feature.\n\n\u201cIt was most feasible to get the category off the ground in South Africa. We wanted to test what kind of traction the category could get, and South Africa is the most suitable pilot test. For us to provide women riders with a category that makes sense, we need to have a certain volume of female drivers in the first place.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nThe rate at which Africans use the Internet for cybercrime is alarming and rapidly increasing. Cybercrime affects all countries, but Africa is particularly vulnerable due to inadequate network and security.\n\nAn estimate shows that cybercrime costs the global economy $500 billion, as of 2016. A 2021 study by Techshielder, a technology and online security platform, describes Nigeria as the second most notorious country in the world for romance scams, after the Philippines.\n\nIf I continue with the types of fraud and the countries that top each list, it won\u2019t be surprising to see an African country on every list, which is very worrisome. For instance, South Africa, after Kenya, is the African country most affected by fraud, draining millions of dollars from the mobile accounts of cellular users worldwide on a daily basis, according to research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Evina, a French cybersecurity firm with a presence in more than 70 countries worldwide \u2013 including 15 in Africa \u2013 a recent report titled State of Mobile Fraud in Africa, shows that professional cybercriminals targeting Africa\u2019s one billion mobile phone users continue to be a significant problem.\n\nTo fight this, the company which claims to specialise in fighting fraud in Africa has recently raised a \u20ac20 million (~$23m) Series A to help them improve their game in fighting fraud.\n\nI find that interesting because the company declared that at least half of the \u20ac20 million capital injection will be used to combat fraud in Africa. Yes, you read that correctly; over $12 million will be invested in combating mobile fraud in Africa.\n\nWhile I\u2019m interested in how the company intends to accomplish this, there\u2019s also an indigenous company in Nigeria, Stellas digital bank planning to combat fraud. But before I discuss that, let\u2019s see what happens to your data when you die.\n\nSide bar: Is it possible that the rise of startups focused on combating fraud will help achieve its purpose in Africa? What do you think? Please, click the reply button to respond.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to your data when you die?\n\nWho will have access to your accounts if you die right now? Do your siblings or parents have access to all of your digital assets?\n\nNot to scare you, but those thoughts were playing through my head about a fortnight ago. What if, despite my optimism, I kick the bucket without any warning? What will happen to my social media accounts, email accounts, and the small sums of money I\u2019ve saved in Cowrywise and Piggyvest if I don\u2019t wake up again after tonight? I mean, I\u2019d like my family to have it, but how likely is that after I die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many daily functions, tasks, and memories now taking place online, the question of what will become of your digital legacy \u2013 who will preserve, control, or delete your accounts after you die \u2013 has become increasingly important.\n\nMaking a plan now can help you avoid identity theft, save documents and records you want to keep, and keep your friends and family from receiving painful pop-up reminders on social media.\n\nHowever, there are numerous potential stumbling blocks to organising your digital will, ranging from privacy concerns and cybersecurity to copyright.\n\nBut, where does your data go when you die in Africa, where you technically have no rights to your data after death?\n\n\n\nIn the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu walked us through what happens to our data when we die. Please read, where does your data go when you die?\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme in 2011, interbank transactions in Nigeria have become much faster, with several experts hailing it as one of the best globally.\n\nFraudsters have also taken advantage of this, executing faster due to the increased speed. Consequently, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in the last decade and $12 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nBecause fraud remains a problem for both digital and traditional banks, Stellas digital bank \u2014 a microfinance bank founded in 2017 to provide easy access to financial services \u2014 has launched a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? The company plans to protect user identities when conducting transactions to prevent identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nBut how is the Bukola Solomon-led company doing that? To know how, please, read: Stellas digital bank launches, plans to fix major loophole for fintech fraud in Nigeria.\n\nPoS for the web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending money from one bank to another 25 years ago was a very different process than it is today. Transfers frequently took several days to reach their intended recipients. To withdraw money, you had to go to the branch where you opened your account.\n\n\n\nHowever, banking innovation has caused the industry to evolve to the point where transfers can now be completed in a matter of minutes. And the industry has grown at an unprecedented rate due to these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more people shopping online, digital payments have become the order of the day, with startups introducing new features to aid this \u2014 like a Point-of-Sale (PoS) solution for the web, for instance. Thepeer, a startup that creates infrastructure that allows businesses to share data, has launched Checkout to create a simple online checkout experience.\n\nCheckout, according to the startup, is simple to integrate and use on a business\u2019s website. Users can shop online and pay from their favourite businesses using Thepeer Checkout.\n\nTo know what the startup does, please read: Backed by Flutterwave, Thepeer wants to help businesses share data seamlessly using its API\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMental health advice to my younger self. Read.\n\nScience vs God: Watch.\n\nThe prison of your mind | Watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThepeer is hiring an android engineer on contract for 3 months. Apply via this tweet.\n\nTradeRepublic is looking to hire 250 into several roles. See where you fit in here.\n\nHave an amazing weekend ahead.\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fakiya Writer. Tech enthusiast.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2011, interbank transactions have gotten much faster in Nigeria with the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme, an infrastructure that several experts laud as being one of the world\u2019s best.\n\nUnfortunately, this speed of execution meant that fraudsters have been able to execute with greater speed. In 10 years, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime, and in just nine months of 2020, it lost $12 million to electronic fraud.\n\nNigeria\u2019s banking space is, perhaps, one of its most critical sectors, as these companies are tasked with providing essential services to millions of people. Interestingly, we\u2019re observing a trend of banks moving from physical branches to having an online-only presence.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not clear how much Nigerian consumer behaviour has adapted to this trend, investors are seemingly betting that these companies will usher in the future of banking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith different incentives and hooks like free transfers, micro-lending, speedy and efficient customer lending, these banks aim to capture segments of the market that have experienced relative neglect by traditional banks.\n\nHowever, fraud remains the bane of both digital banks, and traditional banks alike. For the newly launched Stellas digital bank, it plans to guard against one major loophole.\n\nLed by Bukola Solomon, an executive with extensive experience in the investment banking space, Stellas microfinance bank started in 2017, to provide easy access to financial services, and it soon became one of Nigeria\u2019s leading financial services providers.\n\nToday, the company is launching a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease\u201d. With this launch, it plans to promote privacy and security in the financial services space with its \u201cGhost Mode\u201d feature, as well as other savings and budgeting features, but more on these later.\n\nSolomon explains that the company has always prioritised user experience as one of its biggest value offerings, and it brought that philosophy with its digital banking launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen several instances of people who need to make transactions but want it to remain confidential and private. With our Ghost Mode feature, you can execute confidential transactions, and more so, it serves as a security feature. We can encrypt transactions so that even if they get access to your phone or that of the recipient, your data is secure,\u201d he says.\n\nBasically, Stellas plans to protect user identities when making transactions, to guard against identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nIn 2020, $219 million was lost to identity theft, and these usually come in different forms from social media activities, emails, or credit cards. Solomon points out that transferring money to a random stranger you bought items from could be another potential loophole for identity theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolomon also reveals that all transactions are fully insured by the National Deposit Insurance Commission (NDIC) and will strictly comply with anti-money laundering and anti-fraud regulations.\n\nInteresting bells and whistles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Solomon talks up the Ghost Mode feature, he also reveals that the company has integrated a budgeting feature that would help users create better economic plans for themselves.\n\nSo far, Solomon claims it already has a massive userbase with exciting projections for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have 10,000 users already, and we expect it to reach 200,000 in the first month.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s highly likely that Stellas would be offering its digital banking services to its existing customers, but it would be interesting to see how it would ht 200k users in one month.\n\nIn a space graced by the likes of Kuda, Sparkle, Fairmoney, and Carbon, Nigeria\u2019s digital banking space look set to be exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "NNPC, marketers trade blames over dirty petrol",
          "text": "After the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) issued a statement literally accusing some of the contractors it engaged to swap crude for petrol, these contractors are denying responsibility as they accuse the corporation of playing fast and loose with the truth.\n\nSources close to the transaction tell BusinessDay that greed and excessive profiteering may have played a role in the scandal that has petrol with an unusual amount of methanol sold to Nigerians at the pump across major cities.\n\nAccording to Mele Kyari, the NNPC CEO, on January 20, 2022, the corporation received a report from its quality inspector on the presence of emulsion particles in petrol cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp-Belgium.\n\nKyari said NNPC investigation revealed the presence of methanol in four petrol cargoes imported through the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase (DSDP) suppliers including the consortium MRS, Emadeb Consortium, Oando Consortium, and Duke Oil.\n\nHe said the cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at load port (Antwerp-Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium indicated that the petrol complied with Nigerian specification and that \u201cthe NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem, and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the gasoline met Nigerian specification.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs a standard practice for all petrol imports to Nigeria, the said cargoes were equally certified by an inspection agent appointed by the NMDRA, he noted.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and our discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for percent methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHowever, these suppliers insist that the NNPC should bear the blame and produce evidence of tests that were certified by the NNPC and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), the downstream regulator. One consortium Emadeb/Hyde/Ay Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium disowned member, Brittainia-U.\n\n\u201cWe hereby state that the said importation of the contaminated PMS was executed by a member of the consortium, to wit: Brittania-U.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the blanket claims made against the consortium by the NNPC are misleading and contradict the actual events that happened; they do not fully reflect and/or represent what transpired,\u201d said a statement signed by Emadeb Energy Services Limited, the lead consortium.\n\nHowever, BusinessDay got the clearance NNPC/NMDRA issued to Brittania-U for the supply of 19,993Mt of petrol on January 11, released to the Integrated Terminal for onward delivery to Ibru Jetty before the product was released into the market. What is even more confusing is that Brittania-U claimed it purchased the contaminated petrol from Duke Oil, which is NNPC\u2019s oil trading subsidiary.\n\nMRS, which is also part of another consortium fingered by the NNPC as having delivered the contaminated product under the DSDP, has since issued a statement saying its products were bought from Duke Oil.\n\n\u201cAs one of the beneficiaries, MRS received the product in its depot and distributed the product to only eight of its stations in Lagos.\n\n\u201cFollowing delivery into the tank, it was observed that the product appeared hazy and dark; management immediately directed that further sale(s) should be stopped and the product isolated. Urgent steps were taken to analyse the product to determine the basis for its contamination.\n\n\u201cThe product analysis revealed that the PMS discharged by MT Nord Gainer had 20 percent methanol, which is an illegal substance in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we are aware that alcohol/ethanol is not permitted to be mixed in PMS specification. We immediately informed NNPC, NMDPRA, and MOMAN and it was confirmed that other members had similar experiences,\u201d the MRS said.\n\nHowever, sources tell BusinessDay that blending petrol with high volumes of methanol was a gambit to supply a product 50 percent cheaper than the usual grade of petrol allowed in Nigeria to give them room for profit maximisation.\n\nA BusinessDay investigation that involved speaking with well-informed private and government officials involved in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry, shows that the bid was a deliberate ploy to make huge profit.\n\nAccording to a source, \u201cThe people who did this knew exactly what they were doing. They knew that Nigeria does not test and if the methanol proportion had not been excessive, it would have passed without much fuss.\u201d\n\nThis revelation casts an uncomfortable glare at Duke Oil, an NNPC trading subsidiary from the marketers who allegedly bought the product. Duke Oil, registered in Panama, had operated quietly since 1989. Today, its activities are coming under intense scrutiny from Nigerians online.\n\nFollowing the subsidy scam of 2011, where oil marketers fraudulently collected huge sums of money for petrol that was not supplied, they have not fully earned the public trust. Suspicion of misdeeds immediately swirled around them following BusinessDay\u2019s revelation that the scarcity of the products was borne out of contamination or dirty petrol.\n\nHowever, oil marketers in Lagos told our reporters that the acute shortage of petrol in the Lagos and Abuja areas is getting better after the arrival of a 39,000 tons vessel yesterday. They say the current system whereby the NNPC contracts out petrol importation to selected friends in an opaque system that must end.\n\nLast year, NNPC picked 16 consortia for the contracts for one year starting in August. The list included major Swiss trading firms Trafigura, Vitol, and Mercuria, oil major Total as well as large Nigerian traders Sahara Energy, Oando, and MRS Oil.\n\nThe corporation decided to pair local marketers with foreign oil traders in a consortium that would receive 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil in exchange for products. A total of 320,000 barrels per day of Nigeria\u2019s output was awarded last year.\n\nA leading engineer with significant retail petrol experience says, \u201cThe NNPC adopts this rather opaque and uncompetitive process whereby it chooses the company which it gives crude oil and they in return bring back to the country, refined products. NNPC chooses the companies, the volume, and the fiscal regime. The process is shrouded in secrecy and when it blows up like now, all Nigerians are meant to pay the huge price.\u201d\n\nThis is why accountability groups, like the Natural Resources Governance Institute and Publish What You Pay, have called on the NNPC to let in the sun on the award process.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that the oil and gas sector cannot function effectively with the government at the core of management. It is simply that the state and its agents have internalised corruption in the sector and have defied every known model that seeks to reposition the sector,\u201d states Audu Liberty Oseni, analyst at Publish What You Pay-Nigeria.\n\nOseni notes that this is mainly because, both the state and its agents in the sector benefit when corruption goes on, saying, \u201cWhen that happens, accountability is not encouraged and primitive capitalist accumulation continues.\u201d\n\nRead also: NNPC reassures Nigerians of remedial action over dirty petrol\n\nTo clear up the mess created by the shortage, Nigeria is now having to buy refined products from the spot market where traders charge huge margins.\n\nIn place of the current process, marketers are calling for an open, competitive, and fair process that will involve opening up the market to any Nigerian firm with the competence to handle such national tasks.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is reportedly angry over the affair but as the petroleum minister, it is unclear who his anger is directed at as his refusal to deregulate the sector is partly to blame.\n\nKyari is also angry and it is believed this accounted for the naming of the contractors now blamed for bringing in the off-specification petrol. But many Nigerians say this is passing off responsibility because as the sole importer of petrol it should bear the responsibility for the mess.",

          "title": "What Abuja council elections mean for APC, PDP",
          "text": "For the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), this Saturday\u2019s Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Councils election is not just another democratic exercise as it is done in the other 36 states of the federation.\n\nBasically, the exercise is to elect chairmen into the six Area Councils of Abaji, Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Bwari, Gwagwalada, Kuje, and Kwali, and councillors for the 62 wards that made up the territory.\n\nIn the final list published by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the umpire for the election, 14 political parties have sponsored 473 candidates, comprising 110 for chairmanship and deputy chairmanship as well as 363 stand-bearers for councilor-ship seats.\n\nWhile the other 12 political parties may merely see the election as an opportunity to control government at that level, the remaining two, APC and PDP, the poll is a launchpad to test their strength ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIt is crystal clear and audibly loud that APC, despite its perceived failure, wants to retain power while the PDP with the alleged baggage of having laid the foundation for the socio-economic quagmire of the country when it held sway for 16 years, intends to return to Aso Rock in the next round of the national election.\n\nThe FCT Area Councils\u2019 poll now provides a rehearsal stage for the APC and PDP to claim the soul of Nigeria in 2023 because the nation\u2019s capital is the microcosm of the macrocosm in the country.\n\nThough with indigenous inhabitants of Gbagyi/Gwari, the FCT-Abuja since it became Nigeria\u2019s capital city is populated by almost all the ethnic groups in the country, making it a semi-Nigeria.\n\nMost of the non-indigenous residents of the FCT who have lived in the area for a long period and with some of them given birth to in the city are registered voters and exercised their franchise in the territory.\n\nThus, for either the APC or PDP to win or lose the Saturday\u2019s area councils election may imply acceptability or rejection of each of the parties.\n\nAlso, being the seat of power, the outcome of the election in the FCT gives credence to either APC\u2019s ability to retain power and PDP\u2019s strength to stage a comeback.\n\nThis is because President Muhammadu Buhari, who heads the APC government and all the apparatus thereof, along with his appointees and lawmakers of the party are residents of the FCT, just as the PDP national leadership.\n\nThe outcome of the election is going to be a testimony on the APC, almost more than the PDP because of the general thinking that the party has brought untold hardship on Nigerians to the extent that it would be paid back in its own coins at any available ballot.\n\nThis is the belief of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who was Buhari\u2019s main challenger in the 2019 ballot when he said the FCT council polls were going to be a referendum on the APC.\n\nAtiku had days ago in a statement by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, said the people of the FCT, with their closeness to the seat of power, represent a good sampling of Nigerians and, therefore, should use \u201ctheir ballot to tell the APC government how its administration has made life difficult for the common man.\n\n\u201cThe records of performance between the PDP and APC administrations should provide a guide for the way the people of the FCT should cast their ballot on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI expect every member of the PDP to be proud of the party at this election and even mobilise their families and friends to vote for PDP\u2019s candidates across all the FCT councils on Saturday,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nNeither the political strength of APC nor PDP is in doubt in the FCT, at least judging from the 2019 general election and the Area Councils\u2019 polls.\n\nFor the presidential election, the PDP candidate, Abubakar defeated the APC\u2019S Buhari with 259,997 votes against 152,224; the main opposition also won the only senatorial and two House of Representatives seats in the territory, followed closely by the ruling party.\n\nBut for the FCT Area Council polls, APC took the day having won five out of the six chairmanship with many councillor-ship seats while the PDP got one chairmanship (Kuje Council) and a handful of councillors.\n\nUnlike in other states of the federation where governors allegedly handpick their party members or cronies as council chairmen and councillors through State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIEC), the FCT election is conducted by INEC, which is not a direct appendage of states\u2019 chief executives.\n\nThe territory has no governor despite its status of a state and is rather administered by a minister, who is always not an indigene on behalf of the President, making it a bit not subservient to the whims and caprices of any governor.\n\nHowever, the APC and PDP being at dagger drawn point to test their might in the Saturday FCT Area Council poll, each of them has deployed many of their governors, lawmakers and other top-notch for the electoral battle.\n\nThe PDP appointed a 34-member campaign council, chaired by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State with governors Seyi Makinde of Oyo as secretary, Nyesom Wike of Rivers and Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto; former Senate President, David Mark, immediate past governor of Benue State, Gabriel Suswam, among others as members.\n\nSimilarly, the ruling APC raised a 133-member campaign council, chaired by Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, which included 16 serving governors, 12 federal ministers as well as members of the National Assembly for the same election.\n\nRead also: APC, PDP, others sign peace accord for FCT area council election\n\nBoth the governors-dominated APC and PDP campaign councils are already in Abuja, perfecting plans and campaigning for the victory of their parties on Saturday.\n\nFor instance, the Uzodinma-led APC campaign council has reconciled the warring factions of the party, especially in the AMAC to strengthen the broom family ahead of the Saturday poll.\n\nAlready, an alarm is being raised especially by the opposition PDP in the FCT that APC was planning to disrupt the process and rig its way into power.\n\nFCT PDP chairman, Sunday Zaka, a few days ago alleged that the APC had planned to hire fake security agents from neighbouring Nasarawa and Kogi states to arrest some of its members ahead of the council election.\n\n\u201cIn the build-up to next Saturday the 12th February 2022, local government election in the FCT, our intelligence network have reported some appalling findings and we have deemed it fit as a law-abiding and democratic party to notify the general public and as well as the international community concerning the elections.\n\n\u201cThere is an underground plan to use fake security agents to arrest and detain prominent members and stakeholders of our party ahead of the February 12 election.\n\n\u201cWe are not taking this likely because the same scheme was deployed in the last 2019 election but failed due to the display of professionalism by the heads of security operatives in the FCT, and now this same satanic plan by the opposition is resurfacing, but we believe strongly it will fail again,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut the spokesman of the FCT APC, Usman Adaji, described the allegations as baseless, saying the ruling party had always focused on issue-based campaigns.\n\nAdaji said the opposition PDP was only shedding tears of defeat ahead of the Saturday council election, adding that the PDP was always known for raising false alarms.",

          "title": "CBN plans to drive $200bn non-oil exports",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Bankers\u2019 Committee on Thursday launched the \u201cRT200 FX Programme,\u201d an initiative that would drive some projected annual earnings of up to $200 billion from non-oil exports over the next three to five years.\n\nThe programme, which begins immediately, will help drive in more foreign exchange (FX) earnings, stabilise the local currency, and create jobs in Africa\u2019s largest economy struggling to shore up reserves and has seen unemployment rise to 33.3 percent.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, the CBN governor, who announced the programme after the Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting in Abuja, said it would be anchored on five pillars, including Value-Adding Exports Facility; Non-Oil Commodities Expansion Facility; Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme; Dedicated Non-Oil Export Terminal, and Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit.\n\n\u201cThe RT200 Programme is not intended to be a silver bullet to all the problems in the export segment of the economy, but will help boost productivity and earning capacity of this economy, preserve the long-term value of the naira, and ensure exchange rate stability,\u201d Emefiele warned ahead. He also mentioned plans to halt dollar sales to the banks before the end of the year as the programme fully picks up.\n\nMeanwhile, he announced that the CBN\u2019s concessionary interest rate of 5 percent on its intervention facilities will now be extended until March 1, 2023, in view of the promising trajectory established in economic growth and job creation.\n\nThe Value-Adding Export Facility will provide concessionary and long-term funding for businesses interested in expanding existing plants or building brand new ones for the sole purpose of adding significant value to the non-oil commodities before exporting the same.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, this facility is important because the export of primary unprocessed commodities does not yield much in foreign exchange.\n\nToday, Nigeria produces about 770,000 metric tons of sesame, cashew, and cocoa, out of which about 12,000 metric tons are consumed locally and well over percent of the remaining 758,000 metric tons exported annually, unprocessed.\n\nAlso, Nigeria, a major exporter of cocoa, generates a paltry $804 million from the global chocolate industry valued at about $130 billion, while even smaller countries like Cote D\u2019Ivoire get $3.6 billion annually and Ghana, $1.9 billion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, given these alarming disparities between exporters of raw commodities and exporters of semi-finished or finished products, we believe that the Value-Adding Export Facility is a first step to getting back some of these foreign exchange that we rightly deserve,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expectation is that the facility will also accommodate the demand of Nigerian youths who are already adding value through e-commerce and other tech platforms to provide and export software, financial services, financial technology, fashion, among others.\n\n\u201cAs long as these exports are captured with Form NXP and the FX proceeds are repatriated and verifiable, we will accommodate such businesses under this facility,\u201d he assured.\n\nThe Non-Oil Commodities Expansion Facility will also be a concessionary facility designed to significantly boost local production of exportable commodities and will be designed to ensure that expanded and new factories are financed by the Value-Adding Facility are not starved of inputs of raw commodities in their production cycle, he explained.\n\nIn order to maximise the potential and impact of this facility, certain commodities will be prioritised in line with what other successful export-based economies have done as well as developing special areas that will cater to specific commodities, he stated.\n\nHe further announced the introduction of the Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme, a special local currency rebate scheme for non-oil exporters of semi-finished and finished produce who show verifiable evidence of exports proceeds repatriation sold directly into the I&E window to boost liquidity in the market.\n\nHe said analogous to the Naira4Dollar Scheme, which has helped boost remittances from only $6 million per week to over $100 million per week, the plan is to establish the modalities for granting a rebate for each dollar that non-oil export proceeds that an exporter sells into the market, for the benefit of other FX users and not for funding its own operations.\n\nThe detailed guideline of the scheme will be rolled out next week, he stated, and the plan really is to graduate the percentage of the rebate, depending on the level of value addition into the product being exported.\n\nRead also: CBN introduces new scheme to improve dollar supply\n\nFollowing the perennial problems of port congestion cited by exporters as a major impediment to improved operations and foreign exchange earnings, the Dedicated Non-Oil Export Terminal- the third anchor of the RT200 programme, is crucial, especially as Nigeria, reportedly loses about $14.2 billion annually due to congestion at the ports.\n\n\u201cIf we are to reach our goal of $200 billion in non-oil exports, then we can neither ignore nor wish away this problem. We must confront it head-on and provide a solution.\n\nHe threw a challenge to all state governments that have existing ports and are willing to partner with the Bankers\u2019 Committee to establish not only a dedicated export terminal but also the entire ecosystem of world-class infrastructure needed for non-oil exports.\n\nThe governor said over the next three months, the Bankers Committee will be collecting and analysing detailed proposals from interested state governments in order to decide which one we can partner with.\n\nThe Bankers\u2019 Committee will also be arranging a significant part of the financing that will be needed for this port while the selected State Governments will have their responsibilities spelt out in due course.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this dedicated port will be capable of creating over 100,000 direct and indirect jobs and would provide a huge boost to our quest for significant improvement in non-oil export earnings in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUnder this arrangement, loans to companies wishing to expand or build new plants that will generate verifiable export proceeds for the economy will remain at 5 percent per year for 10 years loans inclusive of 2 years moratorium.\n\nBut to drive the programme, the CBN will host the first Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit, during the first week of April this year.\n\nThe Summit will bring together all the relevant stakeholders in the export business including bankers, customs officials, the Nigerian Ports Authority, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, clearing agents, cargo airlines, shipping lines, logistics companies, insurance practitioners, to harness ideas that will drive the $200 billion in non-oil exports per year.",

The Special Adviser is James Babatunde Agbogun Esq.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cYou have now taken the oath and allegiance of office; your allegiance is to the people of Edo State and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, not to any other individual. Yes, our party nominated us, but we are responsible to every citizen in Edo State, and should not be partisan in discharging our duties.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cThis exercise today effectively formalizes the harmonization of our party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). We have to come together to work for the interest of Edo people first, above everything else.\n\n\u201cYou attended the state\u2019s executive retreat and know the emphasis of our government. You know what we have promised to deliver to Edo people, and by God\u2019s grace, we will deliver them. The assurance of remaining in office is to deliver services to the people of Edo State.\u201d\n\nThe governor while warning against indiscipline in the ruling party in the state said the party will not tolerate opposition within its fold.\n\nObaseki stated, \u201cSome people fail to realise that we are the government in power; they have been opposing us for years and continue to do so. Our party, the PDP, is the party in power and wouldn\u2019t condone opposition within the party.\n\n\u201cThere must be party discipline going forward. We can\u2019t tolerate indiscipline and disloyalty to the party. If you can\u2019t get what you want, it doesn\u2019t mean the party must be disunited. We have been patient enough and want to know who the real opposition is and can\u2019t tolerate disloyalty within the party.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure our loyal party members that we are truly proud of what is going on in terms of the registration which is inching towards half a million members. Our leaders are working diligently, going round the state. By the grace of God, before the end of this month, 10 percent of the population of the state will be PDP members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see how PDP will lose power again in Edo State provided we continue to provide services for Edo people,\u201d he noted\n\nReassuring that his government will sustain policies and programmes to engender sustainable growth and development in the state, the governor added, \u201cAs a government, we are focused on optimising every resource that we have. Edo is ahead of other states, as we have retired godfathers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis appointment is earned based on your contribution to the development of the state, as no godfather pushed us to appoint you; you owe nobody this appointment but God,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nIn his response on behalf of other appointees, Chris Nehikhare hailed the governor for finding them worthy, promising that they will put in their best to effectively contribute to the development of Edo State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

He stated that in developed countries, universities and polytechnics are self -sustaining because of the huge resources accruing to them as royalties from licensing of R&D results.\n\nHe said that the Office was established to regulate the inflow of foreign technologies into the country through the registration of technology transfer agreement and at the same time, encourage the development of indigenous technologies.\n\nThe director-general further stated that in carrying out the responsibilities of the office, it noticed that over 90% of the technologies that power the Nigerian economy were foreign and for a country that aspires to be economically self-sustainable, the situation was unacceptable.\n\nHe said that technologies were products of research and researches were undertaken by the knowledge institutions therefore, Nigerian universities and polytechnics needed an orientation towards problem solving research.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIbrahim stated that in order to sensitize Nigerians and bridge the knowledge gap in the field of Intellectual Property Right (IPR), the Office in 2006 in collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) initiated the establishment of Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Offices (IPTTOs) in some knowledge institutions across the country.\n\nThe DG said the reason for the initiative was to tailor the minds of Nigerian researchers towards problem solving research instead of engaging in convention research for the purposes of career progression. He encouraged researchers to patent their R&D results before publishing for according to him, any research work that is published before patenting is already in the public domain and can be exploited by anybody.",

          "title": "Listing benefits of MeFirst Account for teenagers",
          "text": "FirstBank of Nigeria Limited introduced MeFirst to expose teenagers to cashless culture and electronic payment activities at teen age. In this report, AMAKA IFEAKANDU further highlights the impacts on this facility on teenagers\n\n\n\nWith the advancement in information technology, there is need for parents to open a bank account for children at teenage age to promote their management skill.\n\nThe account opening at teens\u2019 stage of life will help to build children\u2019s financial reputation. No doubt, operating a bank account would offer teenagers an opportunity to go beyond learning how to save money; but to learn how to earn and spend money.\n\nMany children today opted to combine part-time job with education in order to give financial support to their parents. So, engaging in part-time job gives them the opportunity to open account to start operating their financial futures.\n\nThis type of arrangement has numerous benefits to instilling not only good work ethic and responsibility in a teenager, but also enable them to use their hard-earned funds as they wish\u2014within reason, of course.\n\nHowever, with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\u2019s mandate to increase financial inclusion in the country, the nation\u2019s banks offer parents and guardians the opportunity to operate functional accounts for their children from their teen to the adult age of 18.\n\nIn other words, teens banking helps the underage learn early to save money and allows parents to save for the future of their wards.\n\nBenefits of Teenage Bank Account\n\nApart from teaching about working, saving, and growing one\u2019s money, Teenage Bank account promotes a strong sense of self-accountability. In other words, a teenager\u2019s bank account with debit card allows them to manage their money, and as a by-product, they\u2019ll need to account for their purchases in order to keep their account \u201cin the black.\u201d This idea of accountability works both in terms of responsibility and accounting.\n\nAnother thing is that being a teenager with a bank account and debit card can be a nice preview of how things work in the world of finances. They will learn to really question the necessity of purchases and will also learn that growing one\u2019s wealth is not just about putting money in a savings account but to have more knowledge on how to plan for the future. There are other ways to benefit from having a debit card and using it wisely, including utilising certificates of deposit or higher-yield accounts, or even putting funds aside toward a bigger purchase, such as a down payment on some of their personal needs like buying computer, laptop , new phone etc. Parents are expected to monitor movement of funds in teenage account to know the right time to expand their education about investing and growing their income in another investment like investing in equities among others.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s MeFirst Account\n\nThe First Bank of Nigeria Limited created Mefirst Account to encourage the right savings culture among children. MeFirst account is designed for teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17. This account is created in recognition of the need to help teenagers adopt the culture of financial responsibility and cashless payment as they develop into young adults. They have access to attractive and trendy pre-paid cards through which parents/guardians can credit weekly/monthly allowance and monetary gifts. MeFirst account holders can select from five exciting card design options that suites their trendy style. According to the bank, Mefirst cards are enabled to pay for micro online shopping as desired \u2013 mobile games, apple music, Spotify and local POS transactions as well. Teens are thereby exposed to the cashless culture and electronic payment activities early in life, which is expedient in today\u2019s digital age.\n\nParents and guardians of the child are granted access to track and control the spending pattern. The product also, has relevant enhancements including appropriate parental guidance and financial discipline for children as they grow into adulthood\n\nDescription\n\nAlso, MeFirst account helps teenagers to embrace the culture of financial responsibility from a young age, keeping them positively engaged and entertained. Teenagers between the ages of 13 to 17 learn all about money in fun ways as benefits enjoyed for opening this account.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe account is opened in the child\u2019s name but operated by the parent/guardian. The account maintains Zero account opening balance with Automatic transition to XploreFirst Account when the teenager attains the age of 18 years. Apart from having pre-paid card for the child in five design options on which parents/ guardians can load weekly/monthly allowances, there are Cheques & Dividend warrants lodgement into the account\n\nMeFirst accounts can be opened with zero balance and operated with a minimum balance of N100.00.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s view of teens Account\n\nSpeaking on the accounts, Gbenga Shobo, FirstBank\u2019s Deputy Managing Director said: \u201cWe are delighted with the role we play in promoting financial literacy amongst children and teenagers in the country. Our MeFirst and KidsFirst accounts are designed to ensure that parents and guardians are able to have their wards exposed to the right savings culture and financial discipline as they evolve to adulthood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith these accounts, parents are able to save and strengthen their preparedness for various financial obligations of their children like paying for school fees as they progress with their academic pursuit which is pivotal to securing the future of the children. MeFirst account is essential gifts from parents to their children,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Two policemen have been shot dead as armed robbers attacked a bullion van at the Iwo Road area of Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nThe attack which happened on Thursday, left people scampering for safety as the exchange of gunshots between the robbers and security agents attached to the bullion van lasted for some minutes. Commuters were forced to abandon their cars in the middle of the road as security operatives struggled to repel the attack.\n\nREAD ALSO: NNPC GMD Reveals How \u2018Adulterated Fuel\u2019 Was Imported And The Importers\n\nThe Oyo State Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko, who conducted an on-the-spot assessment of the scene of the crime, confirmed that two policemen were killed. She, however, said that one of the robbers was also shot dead during the attack but the robbers made away with his body.\n\nWhile describing the attack as a coordinated one, Onadeko said all exit points in Ibadan have been placed on red alert. According to her, the move is to prevent the fleeing suspects from escaping.\n\n\u201cIt is a coordinated attack which we are still trying to find out what happened because they trailed the bullion van from where it went to get money to dispense it to the place,\u201d the CP said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t definitely say now what actually went wrong, we are trying our possible best to get them. Two of my men were shot in the leg, let us investigate and we will be able to give you more details.\u201d\n\nThe police commissioner stated further that Ibadan is under lockdown with the State Police Command working closely with other security agencies in tracking down the fleeing robbers.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of amateur videos show some commuters with gunshot wounds and two policemen lying motionless after the gun duel with the robbers.\n\nIt is unclear how much money the robbers made away with but police authorities say measures are in place to prevent escape for the suspects as investigations begin to unravel those behind this audacious attack.\n\nSee more photos from the scene below:",

I don\u2019t know what they were thinking of playing him the other night,\u201d said Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party. \u201cThat was just a mistake.\u201d\n\nMore than 300,000 people have signed an online petition calling for Zouma to be prosecuted as the public backlash intensifies in a country renowned for its love of animals.\n\nMoyes is not the only manager under pressure at the King Power on Sunday, with Brendan Rodgers scrambling to revive Leicester\u2019s fortunes.\n\nRodgers was touted as a candidate to be Manchester United\u2019s next permanent boss earlier in the season after leading Leicester to FA Cup glory for the first time in the club\u2019s history.\n\nHowever, their cup defence ended in an embarrassing 4-1 defeat to Championship side Nottingham Forest last weekend and a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Thursday left them languishing in 12th spot in the table.\n\n\u2013 Man Utd stumble \u2013\n\nManchester United and Tottenham also have to bounce back from poor midweek results that cost them ground in the race for the top four.\n\nUnited were held 1-1 at bottom-of-the-table Burnley, while Spurs blew a 2-1 lead late on to lose 3-2 at home to Southampton.\n\nTottenham could drop as low as eighth if they lose to Wolves on Sunday and manager Antonio Conte is not confident of their chances of climbing into the top four despite having games in hand.\n\n\u201cThis season we are going to struggle to get three points,\u201d said the Italian.\n\n\u201cIf we want to grow and try to be competitive as a team, the first thing you have to improve is stability. Not be up and down, up and down.\u201d\n\nFrank Lampard also suffered a disappointing start to life in the Premier League with Everton on Tuesday as a 3-1 defeat at Newcastle left the Toffees perilously placed just above the relegation zone.\n\nEverton have been in England\u2019s top flight since 1954 but are sinking like a stone, with just one win in their past 15 league games.\n\nLeeds\u2019 trip to Goodison Park on Saturday gives Lampard\u2019s team the chance to earn themselves some breathing space, with relegation-threatened Norwich facing leaders Manchester City and Burnley hosting Liverpool.\n\nFixtures (all times GMT)\n\nSaturday\n\nManchester United v Southampton (1230), Brentford v Crystal Palace, Everton v Leeds, Watford v Brighton (all 1500), Norwich v Manchester City (1730)\n\nSunday\n\nBurnley v Liverpool, Newcastle v Aston Villa, Tottenham v Wolves (all 1400), Leicester v West Ham (1630)",

Matters of security have become the business of all the nations of the world to work closely together to build consensus in order to overcome these challenges.\u201d\n\nBuhari told the diplomats that, \u201cfor us in Nigeria We continue to make steady progress despite the daunting challenges, especially in the areas of insecurity, fight against corruption, diversification of the economy, and our efforts in promoting good governance, amongst other aspirations.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe noted that Nigeria\u2019s differences and divergence in culture and religion had contributed immensely in cementing unity, as a people, as well as spurring religious tolerance and respect for one another.\n\nBuhari urged the Ambassadors to build lasting friendships in the course of performing their duties that will go beyond assignments in Nigeria.\n\nAt the regional level, the president said Nigeria would continue to work with other member-states of ECOWAS and regional blocs to deal with the problems of terrorism, trans-border crimes, banditry, maritime issues and unconstitutional change of government.\n\n\u201cWe are engaging in frank self-retrospection in order to identify and isolate appropriate containment strategies that can help de-escalate the drift into the unconstitutional seizure of power in the sub region,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nBuhari assured of partnership and mutual cooperation in canvassing more Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in healthcare system, education, infrastructure, local manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness and transportation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe countries which you all represent, namely, Czech Republic, Republic of Italy, Kingdom of Spain and State of Israel, enjoy very cordial bilateral relations and cooperation with Nigeria that span across our socio-economic and cultural spheres.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the envious task of building on the successes of your respective predecessors will further advance our relations to significant heights for the benefits of our countries and peoples.\n\n\u201cAs you settle down to your diplomatic responsibilities, I am sure that you will appreciate the uniqueness and strength in our country\u2019s political, socio-economic and cultural diversities, in terms of both human and natural resources.\u201d\n\nResponding on behalf of other envoys, the Ambassador of Czech Republic assured the President of, \u201ccomprehensive cooperation\u2019\u2019 of the representatives.\n\nKrejc said the envoys would work for the development of Nigeria, through strengthening of mutual and beneficial relations with their countries.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

Benjamin Kalu faulted Malami\u2019s insinuation. He explained that there was nowhere in the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and the House rules where selfish interest was allowed as an instrument to be used in the process lawmaking.\n\nAccording to him, in view of the dynamics of the society, challenges experienced in the country, the 2010 Electoral Act was obsolete and can no longer meet the demands, expectations, ethos and principles of democracy.\n\nHe added that if the nation was serious about advancing democracy, then people should stop playing to the gallery and do what the public interest says.\n\nKalu said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why to advance that particular aspect, the Constitution and House rules made provision for public hearing, for stakeholders\u2019 engagement for memorandum to be sent in, for presentation to be made for town halls. So, these public engagements are not self-serving because not all of them are parliamentarians.\n\n\u201cSome of them are civil society organisations, faith-based organisations, political organisations, traditional organisations, researchers and believers, disciples and advocates of democracy. And there is a thin line running through all their opinion and that thin line is that the 2010 electoral act is obsolete.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is the parliament of the people. Whatever actions that will take, motions that move, resolution we made and bills that we make, we make not as unto ourselves to the exclusion of others, we make it to the generality of Nigerians because for now, we are members of the parliament. Who knows tomorrow, we might be in the executive or even be outside the government.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on if the lawmakers will lobby the President to assent to the Bill, the spokesman said they can\u2019t as they would be interfering in the Executive\u2019s independence as proposed by the constitution.\n\nSunday Aborisade and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Thursday announced a new programme to stimulate the country\u2019s non-oil exports and achieve $200 billion repatriation of proceeds between three to five years.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme, code-named, \u201cRace to $200 billion in FX Repatriation (RT200 FX Programme),\u201d which takes immediate effect, consists of a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports which would help the country attain its goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports transactions over the next three to five years.\n\nHe added that the initiative was a product of consultation with the banking community.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of the 364th meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee in Abuja, the CBN governor also announced further extension of all the central bank\u2019s concessionary five per cent interest rate on its intervention facilities till March 1, 2023.\n\nThe CBN had in January 2021, approved an extension on all its facilities by 12 months to March 2022, from the earlier March 2021 expiration date, against the backdrop of the dangers posed by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic businesses.\n\nThe concessions were provided during the first wave of the pandemic as part of measures to cushion its impact on businesses and economy.\n\nThis was as Emefiele further hinted that the central bank may end the sale of FX to banks for the purpose of funding their export bills, adding that the banks would be rather encouraged to generate their export revenue and proceeds.\n\nHe, however, explained that the new non-oil export initiative would have five key anchors namely value-adding exports facility; Non-oil commodities\u2019 expansion facility; Non-oil FX rebate scheme; Dedicated non-oil export terminal as well as Biannual non-oil export summit.\n\nEssentially, he said the new FX drive was informed by the inadequacy in FX supply and constant pressure on the exchange rate, pointing out that the country\u2019s four major sources of FX inflow namely: proceeds from oil exports, proceeds from non-oil exports, diaspora remittances, and foreign direct/portfolio investments had been constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe the lessons we have learnt from our policies on remittances can be applied in improving some aspects of FX inflow into the country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further argued that most of the sources of FX inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, we need to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange. We would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.\u201d\n\nHe said though the $200 billion FX proceeds target appeared unattainable to some, \u201cBut I am resolute and determined that we can achieve it.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor added: \u201cMany countries that are much less endowed than Nigeria are doing it. Consider for example that agriculture exports alone from the Netherlands was about $120 billion last year.\n\n\u201cYet, Netherlands has a land mass of about 42,000 square kilometers, which is much smaller than the land mass of Niger State alone, at over 76,000 square kilometers.\u201d\n\nHe said while the RT200 Programme was not intended to be a silver bullet to all the challenges in the export segment, it remained a first step meant to ensure that the CBN was able to carry out its mandate in an effective and efficient manner, which guarantees preservation of the scarce commonwealth, and the stability of the naira.\n\nEmefiele insisted that, \u201cIt is only by boosting productive and earning capacity of this economy that we can truly preserve the long-term value of our currency, as well as the stability of our exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele, while justifying the extension of the concessionary loans, said the impact of the intervention measures helped the country make the fastest recovery from recession ever recorded and changed the trajectory of inflation to an eight-month downward spiral.\n\nHe noted that although interest rates on the CBN\u2019s various intervention facilities were expected to revert to nine per cent effective March 1, 2022, it has been extended to March, 2023.\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cWe are announcing that the rates would remain at five per cent for another year in view of the promising trajectory we have established in economic growth and job creation. In effect, the concessionary interest rate of five per cent on our intervention facilities would now be extended until March 1, 2023.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed that the policies and measures adopted by the bank led to a significant improvement in diaspora inflow from an average of $6 million per week in December 2020, to an average of over $100 million per week by January 2022.\n\nCommenting further on plans by the central bank to limit FX sales to banks for exports activities, Emefiele said: \u201cThe banks don\u2019t have a choice, and I said so this morning in the meeting,\n\n\u201cI said the era is coming to an end because when your customers need $100 million, $200 million foreign exchange demand, and so you want to pack all the dollar and pass it to CBN to give you dollar \u2013 that era is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cI have told them at the meeting before, that latest end of this year, we would tell them don\u2019t call the central bank for FX again, rather go and generate your export revenue and proceeds.\n\n\u201cFund people who want to generate export proceeds, when those export proceeds come, we would fund them at five per cent for you and they would earn rebate and that\u2019s how we can help you.\n\n\u201cThen, when these proceeds come, sell them to your customers that want $100 million or $200 million. That you will continue to come to central bank to give you dollar, we would stop it.

IMF reiterated the need for the Nigeria government to implement timely fiscal reforms.\n\nIMF\u2019s Mission Chief for Nigeria, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, said these on Thursday, during a virtual media briefing on its Nigeria\u2019s 2021 Article IV Consultation Staff Report.\n\nRahman noted that the increase in public debt had grown rapidly in 10 years and was approaching a time when the country would spend all its income on servicing debts. She stressed the need for urgent fiscal reforms.\n\nRahman explained, \u201cBut what we should remember here and the things that make Nigeria\u2019s debt sustainability at risk are the following: we have seen a rapid rise in public debt in the last 10 years or so and this is being driven by fiscal deficits.\n\n\u201cSo, the dynamics is not that great. And there are a couple of other points that we should remember; which is that Nigeria\u2019s debt carrying capacity is very low. For us, revenue levels are low comparing to a typical emerging market country that spends less than 10 per cent of revenues on interest payments.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria\u2019s case, that ratio, if you just take federal government, it\u2019s over 80 per cent of revenues, if you take the consolidated, it is around a third, but the federal government is responsible for paying this debt service. So that\u2019s one point.\n\n\u201cThe second point is on the access side. Market access for Nigeria, that is international market access, like Eurobond, etc., is highly dependent on what happens to oil prices, more so than some other commodity exporters and oil exporters. So that makes Nigeria quite vulnerable.\u201d\n\nRahman said going forward, IMF projected for Nigeria a continuous increase in public debt.\n\n\u201cSo, we are projecting you will see public debt to go up from 36 per cent of GDP to close to 43 per cent of GDP in the medium term,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, it is increasing and it is reaching that level where you should be concerned, everybody should be concerned,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cNigeria has favourable dynamics in the sense that high inflation and low interest rates are keeping these dynamics in favour of Nigeria, right. But if that were to change because growth rates are not high, you could see public debt growing up very fast.\u201d\n\nResponding to a THISDAY inquiry on the impact fuel subsidy removal and value added tax (VAT) would have the masses, Rahman explained that tax reforms were a necessity to boost the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nShe also restated the need for the federal government to remove fuel subsidy, saying it is costly and regressive.\n\nRahman stated, \u201cA country that has little fiscal space to have a subsidy that benefits mostly the rich doesn\u2019t make sense. So, there are economic and social grounds for removing this subsidy.\n\n\u201cOf course, will it impact the poor because it\u2019s a universal subsidy it affects the poor, too. So, removing subsidy would have impact on poverty.\u201d\n\nThe IMF official added, \u201cAnd if you look at Nigeria\u2019s past attempts to remove fuel subsidies, it has always been difficult. But it would be important that in addition to having social assistance, targeted social assistance for the vulnerable and the poor and it also will need strong political will and a well-designed public campaign to demonstrate the merits of this reform and a full transparency in the use of resources. Without this important reform there is risk of reversal again.\u201d\n\nNume Ekeghe",
