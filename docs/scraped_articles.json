          "title": "Femi Kuti: Global Citizen Ambassador Against Poverty",
          "text": "By Oreva Akpoborie\n\nOlufela Olufemi Anikulapo Kuti, eldest son of late Afro beat legend, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, needs no introduction in this clime. What many perhaps may not know, is that, the four-time Grammy award nominee is an Ambassador of Global Citizen, an organization with\n\ninitiative to tackle extreme poverty across the world, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic which continues to ravage the globe.\n\nThis won\u2019t come as a surprise as activism runs in his lineage. With a grandmother who was a political campaigner and father who suffered military brutality for his activism and uncles who took to the streets to protest all kinds of injustices, following in this tradition comes predictable.\n\nIn this encounter, he talks about his work with Global Citizens, the COVID 19 Vaccine and a word of advice for the youths especially those bent on seeking greener pastures overseas.\n\nYou\u2019ve been an ambassador for Global Citizen for about 3 years now. What informed this decision?\n\nI was introduced to the organization by Chris Martin in South Africa. I met some of their leaders and they were very down-to-earth people. I\u2019ve been involved in activism with my father; he was active for about six decades and on my own, for about four decades. In all these, I\u2019ve realized that you can\u2019t do things alone. Global Citizen have ground soldiers who can put things into action, even this concert.\n\nYes, we can organize Felabration, we even organize Felabration world-wide, but Global Citizen have contacts with a lot of people and leaders around the world that they can use to force that change. They have soldiers on the ground, who is who that is working for them that you don\u2019t know except they tell you.\n\nSo, when you have an organization as serious as that taking on issues that I largely believe in like the quest to end poverty, I don\u2019t have a problem teaming up with them.\n\nLast year, Nigeria overtook India to become the poverty capital of the world. What do you think needs to change?\n\nWas India ever ahead of Nigeria? It depends on who is looking at the charts; first or second, poor is poor. I don\u2019t even understand those kinds of statistics. People are being killed and kidnapped and there is poverty in the land. The country has been deteriorating since 1970\u2019s when my father started talking about it. There is no one in our history that has not seen Nigeria going downhill. So what has changed? We need a complete overhaul of the entire system. We need to focus inwards, we need leaders who will motivate the young people. We don\u2019t need dictators as this present system shows oppression and dictatorship-minded people who lie and rule for selfish reasons. For example, politicians that partook in the June 12, are still involved in politics and currently have no mission.\n\nAfricans need to embrace Pan-Africanism and think inwards. The ruling government need to have an ideology by following the steps of Malcom X, Marcus Garvey, Thomas Sankara and Kwame Nkrumah. We should be the envy of the world. I\u2019m telling you how we have mismanaged ourselves and that mismanagement, comes from slavery.\n\nThe colonialists have confused our minds. We are not looking to improving on the right things; our culture should be our priority and way of life. We are having this interview in English, it should be in an African language. We still think in English when we should make our African language a priority. Our tradition should be our attitude. We don\u2019t even like our names. That\u2019s how slavery made us think.\n\nCould you elaborate more?\n\nWe belittle our system so much so that even our President would go to a foreign land to get adequate care. Whereas, he can build a good hospital here and employ Nigerian doctors from all over the world, provide them with the appropriate equipment and pay them well so that they can stay and work well. Let\u2019s look at the Queen of England; she would prefer to die in the hands of British doctors, even the French president would rather die in the hands of French doctors. That is the way it should be. In our own system, we don\u2019t trust our lives in the hands of our nationals, yet, our doctors are working in all of these lands. We don\u2019t equip them here rather, we ridicule them here and pay them peanuts.\n\nGlobal Citizen has set a target for 2030, to end poverty in the World. Do you think this is feasible in Nigeria?\n\nI remain optimistic. But if I go by the standard of what I have seen in my 59 years in this life, and from my intelligence of 54 years as I recall things from age 5, I don\u2019t think this is feasible. Like I said before, we need a complete overhaul in the system both in mind and attitude. Everything has to completely change. Every youth today is eager to leave the country in search of greener pastures because, none of them believe in the system.\n\nWe weren\u2019t trained to believe in the system., . As Africans, we were educated by the colonial masters to look lowly on ourselves and highly on them. We celebrate failure without realizing that failure is failure.\n\nLet me tell you a story. A long time back, somebody threatened my son that he was going to harm him. So, I quickly adopted several other children from poor families. Long story cut short, these adopted children were doing better than my son academically. My son, Made, struggled academically and these children were doing better than him in school and proved really smart. If I were a bad father, I would have frowned on this situation. But looking into the future, I realized that maybe, someday, one of these children would become a Surgeon and perform a life-threatening surgery that would save my life, or be there for Made in the future.\n\nSo, it is important that in order to eradicate poverty, we need to help educate the poor because they will contribute, be progressive and add to the positive growth of the society when given the needed help.\n\nThe annual Felabration didn\u2019t hold last year because of the pandemic (covid-19). What are your thoughts about the virus and the vaccine?\n\nSome people still don\u2019t believe ithere is COVID 19, but I know some very close people who have died and some family members who were affected, were admitted in the hospital and nearly died. I took my vaccine because I listen to the new reports of foreign countries I would have to visit for one thing or the other.\n\nAll I know is that COVID 19 is here and very real. There is so much propaganda against the vaccine but people are takin it in their millions. Doctors never said the vaccine iis a cure, it only stops you from getting seriously ill. This is the safest option they can come up with at this point for the world to move forward. The President of the United States, Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, have had their vaccines.\n\nMany Doctors in Nigeria I spoke to advised that I take the vaccine. Initially, I had my worries due to the negative information on the vaccine. But, on speaking to these doctors, they debunked this information and it made my decision to take the vaccine easier.\n\nFinally, I hope Felabration will hold. If it does hold, it won\u2019t be like other Felabrations that hosted 50,000 or so people. We have to abide by the Lagos State regulations.\n\nWhat message do you have for Nigerian youths this year and beyond?\n\nThe message I have is that they need to believe in themselves, they need to believe in Pan-Africanism, we need to look inwards. They have to understand they\u2019re the future, whether they like it or not, they will effect change. The question now is, are they going to be like their fathers or are they going to make true change?\n\nBecause of my life with my father, I understood quickly what I needed to give my son Made. So if Made is excelling, it\u2019s all because I\u2019ve given him all the tools, of course he has his God-given talents, but if I don\u2019t give him those tools, he would struggle more.\n\nHe\u2019s going to even have his own obstacles to overcome, but if I don\u2019t arm him, he probably will fail.\n\nI know that education is important, so if you want to be a musician, better read. Yes, I got away with it, but if I give him the opportunity to learn a piano, he teaches himself the bass, the drum, guitar, the trumpet. He was in Europe and I asked him to stay there and excel but he says NO, he wants to come home and contribute to society. That is the vision one wants for his offspring. You can see the Pan-Africanism in him even though he is British. He knows that every drop of water he puts into the bucket for his people can go a very long way.\n\nThe British didn\u2019t make him, his people made him. So, if he\u2019s here, encouraging another generation, better for him, better for his own children. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d tell the youths. I could have left, I could have run away long time ago but because of my training with my father, I could not. Why would I leave? If I left,\n\nthere would have been no shrine currently. If all Fela\u2019s children had left, we\u2019d only be shouting Fela! Fela! and very likely, the government would have killed his name. If Fela\u2019s children didn\u2019t believe in Fela, and in their respective ways, kept his legacy, just a few people would jbe left calling his name today.\n\nMy sister started Felabration, it\u2019s not my dream. Felabration is my elder sister\u2019s dream, We put the shrine together because Fela never had a shrine. Fela was always stripped of owning a shrine. This time, we knew we had to make sure we owned the shrine. We didn\u2019t know we\u2019d go through a lot of obstacles on the way, but thank God. Angels were behind us and we have managed to sustain this place for 21 years. You could tell me a club in this country that has managed that, then I would stop playing.\n\nThere\u2019s no festival in this country that has lasted 21 years and that is because those other ones have no ideology behind it. When you don\u2019t have an ideology behind what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019d just be throwing money to the wind. So, the youths must believe in themselves, they can\u2019t say because the government is corrupt we are going to be corrupt. You can\u2019t say because he\u2019s a thief and he\u2019s driving a Benz, me sef, I want a Benz so I will steal. That\u2019s how we lost our culture, traditions, virtues of of being human beings You have to understand that it\u2019s wrong, our leaders are wrong and they\u2019ve wronged us.

          "title": "Femi Kuti: Global Citizen Ambassador Against Poverty",
          "text": "By Oreva Akpoborie\n\nOlufela Olufemi Anikulapo Kuti, eldest son of late Afro beat legend, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, needs no introduction in this clime. What many perhaps may not know, is that, the four-time Grammy award nominee is an Ambassador of Global Citizen, an organization with\n\ninitiative to tackle extreme poverty across the world, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic which continues to ravage the globe.\n\nThis won\u2019t come as a surprise as activism runs in his lineage. With a grandmother who was a political campaigner and father who suffered military brutality for his activism and uncles who took to the streets to protest all kinds of injustices, following in this tradition comes predictable.\n\nIn this encounter, he talks about his work with Global Citizens, the COVID 19 Vaccine and a word of advice for the youths especially those bent on seeking greener pastures overseas.\n\nYou\u2019ve been an ambassador for Global Citizen for about 3 years now. What informed this decision?\n\nI was introduced to the organization by Chris Martin in South Africa. I met some of their leaders and they were very down-to-earth people. I\u2019ve been involved in activism with my father; he was active for about six decades and on my own, for about four decades. In all these, I\u2019ve realized that you can\u2019t do things alone. Global Citizen have ground soldiers who can put things into action, even this concert.\n\nYes, we can organize Felabration, we even organize Felabration world-wide, but Global Citizen have contacts with a lot of people and leaders around the world that they can use to force that change. They have soldiers on the ground, who is who that is working for them that you don\u2019t know except they tell you.\n\nSo, when you have an organization as serious as that taking on issues that I largely believe in like the quest to end poverty, I don\u2019t have a problem teaming up with them.\n\nLast year, Nigeria overtook India to become the poverty capital of the world. What do you think needs to change?\n\nWas India ever ahead of Nigeria? It depends on who is looking at the charts; first or second, poor is poor. I don\u2019t even understand those kinds of statistics. People are being killed and kidnapped and there is poverty in the land. The country has been deteriorating since 1970\u2019s when my father started talking about it. There is no one in our history that has not seen Nigeria going downhill. So what has changed? We need a complete overhaul of the entire system. We need to focus inwards, we need leaders who will motivate the young people. We don\u2019t need dictators as this present system shows oppression and dictatorship-minded people who lie and rule for selfish reasons. For example, politicians that partook in the June 12, are still involved in politics and currently have no mission.\n\nAfricans need to embrace Pan-Africanism and think inwards. The ruling government need to have an ideology by following the steps of Malcom X, Marcus Garvey, Thomas Sankara and Kwame Nkrumah. We should be the envy of the world. I\u2019m telling you how we have mismanaged ourselves and that mismanagement, comes from slavery.\n\nThe colonialists have confused our minds. We are not looking to improving on the right things; our culture should be our priority and way of life. We are having this interview in English, it should be in an African language. We still think in English when we should make our African language a priority. Our tradition should be our attitude. We don\u2019t even like our names. That\u2019s how slavery made us think.\n\nCould you elaborate more?\n\nWe belittle our system so much so that even our President would go to a foreign land to get adequate care. Whereas, he can build a good hospital here and employ Nigerian doctors from all over the world, provide them with the appropriate equipment and pay them well so that they can stay and work well. Let\u2019s look at the Queen of England; she would prefer to die in the hands of British doctors, even the French president would rather die in the hands of French doctors. That is the way it should be. In our own system, we don\u2019t trust our lives in the hands of our nationals, yet, our doctors are working in all of these lands. We don\u2019t equip them here rather, we ridicule them here and pay them peanuts.\n\nGlobal Citizen has set a target for 2030, to end poverty in the World. Do you think this is feasible in Nigeria?\n\nI remain optimistic. But if I go by the standard of what I have seen in my 59 years in this life, and from my intelligence of 54 years as I recall things from age 5, I don\u2019t think this is feasible. Like I said before, we need a complete overhaul in the system both in mind and attitude. Everything has to completely change. Every youth today is eager to leave the country in search of greener pastures because, none of them believe in the system.\n\nWe weren\u2019t trained to believe in the system., . As Africans, we were educated by the colonial masters to look lowly on ourselves and highly on them. We celebrate failure without realizing that failure is failure.\n\nLet me tell you a story. A long time back, somebody threatened my son that he was going to harm him. So, I quickly adopted several other children from poor families. Long story cut short, these adopted children were doing better than my son academically. My son, Made, struggled academically and these children were doing better than him in school and proved really smart. If I were a bad father, I would have frowned on this situation. But looking into the future, I realized that maybe, someday, one of these children would become a Surgeon and perform a life-threatening surgery that would save my life, or be there for Made in the future.\n\nSo, it is important that in order to eradicate poverty, we need to help educate the poor because they will contribute, be progressive and add to the positive growth of the society when given the needed help.\n\nThe annual Felabration didn\u2019t hold last year because of the pandemic (covid-19). What are your thoughts about the virus and the vaccine?\n\nSome people still don\u2019t believe ithere is COVID 19, but I know some very close people who have died and some family members who were affected, were admitted in the hospital and nearly died. I took my vaccine because I listen to the new reports of foreign countries I would have to visit for one thing or the other.\n\nAll I know is that COVID 19 is here and very real. There is so much propaganda against the vaccine but people are takin it in their millions. Doctors never said the vaccine iis a cure, it only stops you from getting seriously ill. This is the safest option they can come up with at this point for the world to move forward. The President of the United States, Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, have had their vaccines.\n\nMany Doctors in Nigeria I spoke to advised that I take the vaccine. Initially, I had my worries due to the negative information on the vaccine. But, on speaking to these doctors, they debunked this information and it made my decision to take the vaccine easier.\n\nFinally, I hope Felabration will hold. If it does hold, it won\u2019t be like other Felabrations that hosted 50,000 or so people. We have to abide by the Lagos State regulations.\n\nWhat message do you have for Nigerian youths this year and beyond?\n\nThe message I have is that they need to believe in themselves, they need to believe in Pan-Africanism, we need to look inwards. They have to understand they\u2019re the future, whether they like it or not, they will effect change. The question now is, are they going to be like their fathers or are they going to make true change?\n\nBecause of my life with my father, I understood quickly what I needed to give my son Made. So if Made is excelling, it\u2019s all because I\u2019ve given him all the tools, of course he has his God-given talents, but if I don\u2019t give him those tools, he would struggle more.\n\nHe\u2019s going to even have his own obstacles to overcome, but if I don\u2019t arm him, he probably will fail.\n\nI know that education is important, so if you want to be a musician, better read. Yes, I got away with it, but if I give him the opportunity to learn a piano, he teaches himself the bass, the drum, guitar, the trumpet. He was in Europe and I asked him to stay there and excel but he says NO, he wants to come home and contribute to society. That is the vision one wants for his offspring. You can see the Pan-Africanism in him even though he is British. He knows that every drop of water he puts into the bucket for his people can go a very long way.\n\nThe British didn\u2019t make him, his people made him. So, if he\u2019s here, encouraging another generation, better for him, better for his own children. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d tell the youths. I could have left, I could have run away long time ago but because of my training with my father, I could not. Why would I leave? If I left,\n\nthere would have been no shrine currently. If all Fela\u2019s children had left, we\u2019d only be shouting Fela! Fela! and very likely, the government would have killed his name. If Fela\u2019s children didn\u2019t believe in Fela, and in their respective ways, kept his legacy, just a few people would jbe left calling his name today.\n\nMy sister started Felabration, it\u2019s not my dream. Felabration is my elder sister\u2019s dream, We put the shrine together because Fela never had a shrine. Fela was always stripped of owning a shrine. This time, we knew we had to make sure we owned the shrine. We didn\u2019t know we\u2019d go through a lot of obstacles on the way, but thank God. Angels were behind us and we have managed to sustain this place for 21 years. You could tell me a club in this country that has managed that, then I would stop playing.\n\nThere\u2019s no festival in this country that has lasted 21 years and that is because those other ones have no ideology behind it. When you don\u2019t have an ideology behind what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019d just be throwing money to the wind. So, the youths must believe in themselves, they can\u2019t say because the government is corrupt we are going to be corrupt. You can\u2019t say because he\u2019s a thief and he\u2019s driving a Benz, me sef, I want a Benz so I will steal. That\u2019s how we lost our culture, traditions, virtues of of being human beings You have to understand that it\u2019s wrong, our leaders are wrong and they\u2019ve wronged us. You can\u2019t get into position and continue with the status quo. When would we get it right?\n\nWhether I like it or not, I\u2019m on the way out. I don\u2019t know when God will call me, but even if God gives me many more years, the strength I had years ago, I don\u2019t have it now. For now, we can only continue to pray for wisdom.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja, Chinelo Obogo, Omoniyi Salaudeen, Lukman Olabiyi and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe battle for control of the reins of power assumed a new twist yesterday, as political leaders drawn from the northern and southern parts announced a new coalition, \u2018Rescue Nigeria Project\u2019 (RNP), with a mission to recruit a competent leader for the country in 2023.\n\nThose who attended the meeting at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, included former national secretary of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Ambassador Usman Bugaje, former minister of education, Prof. Tunde Adeniran, former Kwara governor, Abdul Fatah Ahmed and Prof. Pat Utomi. Conspicuously absent were former deputy governor of Kogi State, Yomi Awoniyi and former Cross Rivers State governor, Donald Duke.\n\nIn his welcome address, Bugaje identified poor leadership recruitment process at the heart of the problems confronting the country. He said the RNP was determined to push for new standards with competence, discipline and character to make a difference.\n\n\u201cThe Rescue Nigeria Project is founded on the premise that the problems of this country, many and varied as they are, all emanate from poor leadership. In other words when you reduce the problems of this country to what they are, ultimately, it all comes to leadership.\n\n\u201cWe have been unable to exit the leadership conundrum precisely because the leadership recruitment mechanism in our political parties is so flawed that, except for accidents, they are incapable of producing competent leaders with the requisite knowledge, discipline and commitment to make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe are living with or better still, groaning under the consequences of this folly. What this means is that any attempt to rescue this country from its troubles must first rescue it from the current leadership recruitment mechanism that seems to leverage on money and connection or ethnic sentiments and no premium on knowledge or competence.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is how to introduce a set of criteria or better still re-calibrate the recruitment mechanism in our political parties to prioritize knowledge, competence and character. The deepening crises in the political parties is all the more reason why this re-calibration is necessary.\n\n\u201cOur core values, rightly start with ethical leadership which speaks to the character of leaders, the key features of competence, capacity and the courage to do the right thing, motivated by patriotism, selflessness and service, conscious of inclusiveness, fairness, equity, mutual respect and accommodation.\n\n\u201cWe intend to renew the spirit of leadership and create new standards to speak to the role this great country is expected to play in the great continent of Africa..\n\nOn calls for zoning of elective offices, particularly the presidency, Bugaje said priority should be given to competence.\n\n\u201cWe must seek to change the conversation about leadership. The first thing we should want to know about our president is not which part of country he or she comes from, rather how competent is he or she? What is the content of his policy document? What is his team made up of, etc. We also seek to ensure a seismic shift from the politics of big men to the politics of big ideas. The empty politics of big men has not taken us anywhere but down the drain. We simply can\u2019t continue this way.\n\n\u201cWe also have to prioritise Knowledge, because as we all know, in the 21st century, knowledge is the greatest capital. That is the only thing that give countries the competitive edge. Governance must be driven by ideas, it has to be creative and must create solutions, especially job creation, economic growth and prosperity.\u201d\n\nFormer Kwara governor, Ahmed, said performance of the present administration in the last six years fell short of expectations of most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, Nigerians embraced change. Today, that change appears to be what we didn\u2019t expect. There is insecurity. There is widespread poverty and incompetence in government. Today, we have high level of nepotism and lack of exclusiveness. These have given rise to agitations by different ethnic groups.\u201d\n\nProfessor Adeniran alerted the nation to what he described as the growing loss of direction and hopelessness amongst Nigerian youths.\n\nMeanwhile, Elder-statesman and frontline Yoruba leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo and the Aare Onakankanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, have tackled the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) on its plot to retain power beyond 2023.\n\nDirector of Publicity and Advocacy of the group, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, had insisted that North has the votes and would not play second fiddle to any other part of Nigeria.\n\nThe Arewa group said it had no apologies for rejecting the demands of the Southern Governors Forum that the 2023 presidency be zoned to the South.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV Morning Show, Ahmed, who was responding to the backlash by prominent southerners and groups said no one has the constitutional right to compel any part of the country on how to vote and that if northerners chose to elect a northern president in a free and fair election, people should have to live with it.\n\n\u201cThe approach of the southern governors and some organised groups in the south in speaking from both sides of the mouth is wrong. Even as we speak, certain southern governors who are saying we must do this or that are secretly negotiating and jostling for positions for themselves for 2023. They know all the options that are available and are actively involved in this. They know the politicians from the northern part of the country including their colleagues but they come out and create a bipartisan fallacy and start making demands that they know are inconsistent with the democratic process. This should stop because it is not helping. What we are saying is to allow a democratic process to determine who will become our president and we should ensure that we pick someone better than President Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to Chief Edwin Clark who faulted the claim that the population of the north is an advantage, Hakeem said: \u201cFor people like Chief Adebanjo and sometimes, Chief Clark to say things like, \u2018if you don\u2019t do this, there would be no elections in 2023\u2019, (they) have no control over what happens in 2023. These kind of statements are what cause tension in the country.\n\n\u201cWith due respect, there are many elderly people like Chief Clark and Chief Adebanjo who speak in a language which elders should not be speaking. They have no business leading groups. These are people who create more problems for politicians and politicians become hostages of rhetorics that people have.\u201d\n\nHowever, Adebanjo, in his reaction said: \u201cI agree with him that we are not patriots because we don\u2019t agree to the subjugation of the South to the Fulani in the North. If that is why we are not patriots, we agree. On the issue of power shift, what he said about retaining power in the North is part of the arrogance of their leaders, who want Nigeria to remain one, but on the condition that they have the rulers. It will not work. We had discussed that with his forefathers; so, we are not going to argue that with him again. If that is why we are not patriots, we are not going to agree on that. We knew we wouldn\u2019t need their agreement before we said that we are not going to have presidency in the North in 2023. That is why we are insisting on changing of the constitution, which they gave to us through the military in 1966. And until that one is done, there can be no peace in this country. We are not going to stay in Nigeria where they will be the rider and we will be the horse. I don\u2019t want to go into any argument with him. When did he come into existence? We\u2019ve had these arguments with his forefathers. We don\u2019t need to argue that again.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Adams said other regions of the country were fully aware of the antic of the North to continue to dominate them and were ready to turn the table around.\n\nThe Yoruba generalissimo who spoke at Ibeju, Lagos during the maiden edition of Egbe Festival organized by the Olokun Festival Foundation (OFF), lambasted said NEF\u2019s statement only exposed the domineering agenda of the north and was capable of setting the nation on fire.\n\nHe held that Nigeria was not property of any region and any attempt by the North to force it domineering agenda on others would be resisted.\n\nThis is Igbo youths under the aegis of the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, (COSEYL) warned that the South East would produce its own president if that happens.\n\nAhmed, while speaking at the maiden Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture Series organized by the students wing of Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, said anyone who did not want a northerner as president in 2023 can leave the country.\n\nHowever, in a statement by it president general, Goodluck Ibem, the group described the utterance by the northern statesman as unfortunate and disapointing.\n\n\u201cIt was the support of the south that made President Buhari to win his elections in 2015 and 2019. We are very surprised that Hakeem has suddenly forgotten so soon how President Buhari emerged as president. History doesn\u2019t lie, he should go back to history to refresh his memory. We, as the youth leaders of South East geopolitical zone, stand by the decision of the southern governors that the office of the Nigerian president be zoned to the South for equity and justice. Enough said,\u201d Ibem stated.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "text": "The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has described his nomination for The Sun Man of the Year 2020 Award as a loud call to double his efforts in delivering on his mandate .\n\nSpeaking when he received The Sun delegation led by the Managing Director/Editor-In-Chief, Mr Onuoha Ukeh, who visited to present to him a letter notifying him of his nomination as The Sun Man of the Year 2020, in Abuja, Kyari said he was humbled by the recognition.\n\nHe stressed that singling him out forcthe award in the midst of millions of illustrious Nigerians would propel him to surpass his current feat.\n\nThe NNPC boss said: \u201cI wonder if I do deserve this award because I\u2019m just doing what I have to do as NNPC GMD. I\u2019m working according to my conscience and the need to make this place a better place. That is the least I can do. Doing something that makes you happy without regret and being honoured for it gives a good feeling. This appreciation comes from the depths of my heart.\n\n\u201cTo be singled out among many excellent Nigerians is also good, but this is a huge challenge. I can\u2019t query your choice of me. Irrespective of my thoughts, it\u2019s a challenge to do more to show I merit the honour and add one more step everyday. It\u2019s a call to more duty, to make Nigeria a better place because there are people watching what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe elated NNPC GMD said he was looking forward to receiving the award on October 16, while giving assurance of working in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nNoting that \u201c no country develops without being inclusive,\u201d Kyari said being inclusive, in his context, does not mean the usual ethnic narrative but a strategic cause aimed at achieving national cohesion.\n\n\u201cThere is hunger everywhere and challenges everywhere. So, inclusion is key here so it can benefit everyone and you would see all these issues of secession die down,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, The Sun MD told Kyari that his name was selected by the newspaper\u2019s board of editors, after a rigorous procedure that considered many factors bordering mainly on achievements and character.\n\nListing why the NNPC GMD was chosen, he said: \u201cWe note that following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, you, realising the condition of the country\u2019s existing healthcare system, rallied operators in all oil and gas sectors to raise over N21 billion to support the fight against the spread of the disease.\n\n\u201cUnder your leadership, 26 per cent of the fund raised to support the fight against COVID-19 was deployed for the provision of logistics and in-patient support equipment such as ambulances, ventilators, isolation centres, etc, with every state of the federation benefitting from the donations.\u201d\n\nHe said at the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NNPC continued to deliver on its mandate by signing the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract of the NLNG Train-7 project with the SCD JV Consortium comprising affiliates of Saipem, Chiyoda and Daewoo.\n\n\u201cLast year, NNPC recorded major strides in the gas sector with the commissioning of the Oredo Integrated Gas Handling Facility (IGHF) and the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and Dispensing Unit, constructed to address domestic gas supply challenges. The facilities currently deliver over 200 million standard cubic feet of dry gas per day and 330 metric tonnes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas) which is equivalent to 16 units of 20 tonnes LPG trucks per day into the domestic market.\n\n\u201cAs NNPC GMD, you have ensured the publication of the Audited Financial Statements of the Corporation and its 19 subsidiaries registered under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 1990, as amended alongside that of the National Petroleum Investment and Management Services (NAPIMS) to provide clarity on Joint Venture finances. This is the first time the Corporation\u2019s Audited Financial Statements were ever made public.\u201d\n\nThe Sun MD noted that Kyari had led NNPC to achieve a $300 million reduction in the cost of the AKK Gas Pipeline contract via contract renegotiation from the initial $2.8billion.\n\nHe further stated that the NNPC executed a Joint Venture agreement with NIPCO to help in the marketing and distribution of the product, with the aim of getting as many Nigerians as possible to migrate to the use of gas as automotive fuel.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Awards ceremony will be held at the Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Saturday, October 16.\n\nApart from Kyari, others who will receive awards are: Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State (Man of the Year); Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State ( Governor of the Year); Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State (Political Icon); and Comrade Philip Shaibu, Deputy Governor of Edo State (Sports Personality).\n\nOthers are Allen Onyema, chairman, Air Peace and Dr. Adedeji Adeleke (Exceptional Philanthropist); Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), chairman, National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency and Brig Gen Ibrahim Shuaibu, Director General of the National Youths Service Corps (Public Service); Engr Nnamdi Ezigbo, chairman, SLOT Systems Limited and Dr. ABC Ojiakor, chairman, SEPLAT Petroleum Company Ltd (Entrepreneur of the Year); Alhaji Mustapha Ado, chairman, Ammasco International Ltd and Chief Ebuka Onunkwo, Chairman, Seahorse Lubricant Industries Limited (Industrialist of the Year).\n\nAlso to be honoured are First Lady of Ondo State, Chief Mrs. Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu (Most Supportive First Lady,); Chief Obinna Iyiegbu (Obi Cubana), chairman of Cubana Group (Hospitality Icon) and Kanayo O. Kanaya, star actor and producer (Nollywood Icon).\n\nOther award winners are Mr. Moses Ekpo, deputy governor of Akwa Ibom State, Chief Olabode George, Prof George Obiozor, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and Amb.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nThe Senate, yesterday, received a request from President Muhammadu Buhari, to amend the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 passed by the National Assembly over two months ago.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter dated September 16, 2021, and read during plenary on Tuesday by Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari in the letter explained that the appointment of two non-executive members as provided for by the Act to the board of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NPRA) and Upstream Regulatory Commission (URC) did not reflect balanced geopolitical representation.\n\nHe, therefore, requested amendment to Sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b) which provides for the Administrative Structure of the PIA 2021, to increase the number of the non-executive members from two to six on the boards of the NPRA and URC.\n\nAccording to him, doing so would foster national unity and \u201cprovide a sense of participation and inclusion to almost every section of the country in the decision making of strategic institutions such as the oil industry\u201d.\n\nIn addition, the president proposed a deletion of Sections 11(2)(f), 11(2)(g), 34(2)(f) and 34(2)(g) from the Petroleum Industry Act, which would see to the removal of the Ministries of Petroleum and Finance form the Board of the Nigerian Petroleum Regulatory Authority and Upstream Regulatory Commission.\n\nHe explained that \u201cthe proposed amendment will increase the membership of the board from nine (9) to thirteen (13) members that is representing 44 percent expansion of the board size.\n\n\u201cThis composition would strengthen the institutions and guarantee national spread and also achieve the expected policy contributions.\n\n\u201cThe two ministries already have constitutional responsibilities of either supervision or inter-governmental relations. They can continue to perform such roles without being in the board.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to not that administratively, the representatives of the ministries in the board will be Directors \u2013 being same rank with Directors in the institution. This may bring some complications in some decision making especially on issues of staff related matters.\u201d\n\nHe also sought an amendment to Sections 11(3) and 34(3) to be replaced with a new section that provides that appointments to the Board of the Commission or Authority under section 2 shall be made by the President, while those made pursuant to subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of section shall be subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n\nThe President further requested that Section 41(2) of the Petroleum Industry Act be replaced with a new section as \u201cthere shall be five (5) executive directors for the Authority whose appointment shall comply with the rules of the Federal Civil Service with each responsible for one of the following.\u201d\n\nThe president, in his proposed the amendment, underscored the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for employees of the Authority.\n\n\u201cIn future, these positions will obviously be filled by the workers in the Authority through career progression in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Federal Civil Service,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

We now have a deficit that has been growing year in, year out. When is it going to stop.\n\nThese are issues that agitate the minds of Nigerians especially when it concerns borrowing.\n\n\u201cWe have a deficit that has gone beyond the threshold of the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007 which then means that is either we amend the FRA so as to accommodate this deficit.\n\n\u201cThe FRA stipulates a threshold of three per cent. Last year it was above the threshold, this year, it is above by six per cent.\n\n\u201cIn managing an economy, we need to combine fiscal policies with monetary policies.

          "text": "*Seeks expansion of upstream, midstream memberships\n\n*Appoints Komolafe CEO of URC, retains DPR\u2019s Auwalu\n\n*Removes petroleum, finance ministries from agencies\u2019 boards\n\n*Sends EFCC board nominees for approval\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nExactly 37 days after the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was enacted, President Muhammadu Buhari has written to the senate, requesting amendments to the law and expansion of membership of the board of the Upstream Regulatory Commission (URC).\n\nBuhari, in a letter read yesterday on the floor of the senate, also sought an increase in the membership of the board of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe president hinged his desire to alter the new law on the need to ensure national balance in appointments into the boards, in the letter dated September 16, 2021, and read yesterday during plenary by Senate President Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari further moved to fast-track the full operation of the newly signed Act, sending a list of nominees for the proposed URC, the regulator of the upstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry as well NMDPRA, which would oversee the midstream and downstream sector.\n\nBuhari explained that the appointment of two non-executive members to the board of the midstream, downstream and upstream commissions, as provided for by the Act, did not reflect balanced geopolitical representation.\n\nThe latest requests came about 48 hours after the president, in his capacity as Minister of Petroleum Resources, triggered Section 53(1) of the PIA, directing the incorporation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited and approving the formation of a new board, which would be headed by Senator Ifeanyi Ararume.\n\nBuhari requested amendment to Sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b), which provide for the administrative structure of the PIA 2021, to increase the number of the non-executive members from two to six on the upstream as well as midstream and downstream boards. He noted that doing so would foster national unity and provide a sense of participation and inclusion to almost every section of the country in the decision-making of strategic institutions, such as the oil industry.\n\nIn addition, the president proposed the deletion of sections 11(2)(f), 11(2)(g), 34(2)(f) and 34(2)(g) from the Act, which would see the removal of the ministries of petroleum resources and finance from both boards.\n\nBuhari wrote in the letter to the upper chamber, \u201cThe proposed amendments will increase the membership of the board from nine to 13 members, that is, representing 44 per cent expansion of the board size. This composition would strengthen the institutions and guarantee national spread and also achieve the expected policy contributions.\u201d\n\nOn the removal of the two ministries from the boards of the agencies, the president explained that they already had clear-cut roles and could carry out those responsibilities without necessarily being on the boards.\n\n\u201cThe two ministries already have constitutional responsibilities of either supervision or inter-governmental relations,\u201d he stressed. \u201cThey can continue to perform such roles without being on the board.\u201d he added, maintaining, \u201cIt is also important to note that administratively, the representatives of the ministries in the board will be directors \u2013 being same rank with directors in the institutions. This may bring some complications in some decision making, especially on issues of staff related matters.\u201d\n\nBuhari also sought amendment to Sections 11(3) and 34(3) of the PIA, which would see them being replaced with a new section that provides that appointments to the board of the commission or authority under Section 2 shall be made by the president, while those made pursuant to Subsection (2)(a), (b) and (c) of the section shall be subject to confirmation by the senate.\n\nBuhari further requested that Section 41(2) of the PIA be replaced with a new section to read, \u201cThere shall be five executive directors for the authority whose appointment shall comply with the rules of the federal civil service.\u201d\n\nIn his proposed amendments, the president underscored the need to exempt serving public officers from the established confirmation process for political appointments, arguing that this will ensure effective management of the regulatory institutions through uniform implementation of public service rules for their employees.\n\n\u201cIn future, these positions will obviously be filled by the workers in the authority through career progression in conformity with the rules and regulations of the federal civil service,\u201d he stressed.\n\nIn the letters to the senate, the president said he was acting in accordance with the provisions of the different laws governing the establishments.\n\nFor the upstream, the president nominated Isa Ibrahim Modibbo as Chairman, while Mr. Gbenga Komolafe was selected as Chief Executive Officer. Hassan Gambo was chosen as Executive Commissioner, Finance and Accounts, while Ms. Rose Ndong was nominated Executive Commissioner, Exploration and Acreage Management.\n\nThe president retained Mr. Sarki Auwalu, who currently heads the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), as Chief Executive Officer of the proposed midstream and downstream authority. He listed Chairman of the authority as Idaere Gogo Ogan; Abiodun Adeniji as Executive Director, Finance and Accounts; and Ogbugo Ukoha as Executive Director, Distributions Systems, Storage and Retail Infrastructure.\n\nBuhari also sent to the upper chamber for screening and possible approval a list of nominees for the board of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe nominees for the EFCC board are George Ekpungu, Secretary to the Commission (Cross River); Lukman Muhammed (Edo); Anumba Adaeze (Enugu); Alhaji Kola Adesina (Kwara); and Alhaji Yahaya Muhammad (Yobe).\n\nBuhari urged the senate to consider and confirm the nominees in an expeditious manner, given the important role they will play in the current administration.\n\nA profile of the CEO of the upstream commission, Komolafe, obtained by THISDAY showed that he had been deeply involved in strategic policy formulation and implementation in the oil and gas industry for about 27 years.\n\nKomolafe is an expert in institutional process study and designs for curbing revenue leakages and attaining optimum national productivity. He has initiated and coordinated various policies that generated and saved the country billions of dollars in his various capacities and national assignments.\n\nThe 57-year-old engineer from Ondo State was Managing Director, Nigeria Pipeline and Storage Company (NPSC), where he initiated the reform and business model for maintenance and operations of NNPC pipelines and depot infrastructure efficiently on private Joint Venture (JV) basis. This saved Nigeria monies that had perennially been expended on national downstream petroleum assets maintenance, operations and security.\n\nIn addition, he was Group General Manager, Special Duties at the NNPC; Group General Manager, Crude Oil Marketing Division; and Executive Director (Commercial) Pipelines and Petroleum Marketing Company (PPMC). He was also General Manager, Operations, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF); and General Manager, Operations, Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), among several other positions.\n\nAside being an engineer, Komolafe has degrees in law, as well as industrial and labour relations, and a recipient of various awards.\n\nBoth chambers of the National Assembly had before embarking on their annual vacation in July passed the harmonised version of the long awaited legislation, before transmitting it to the president for assent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*House alleges fleeing bandits from Katsina, Zamfara attacking Kano\n\n*Emir condemns dialoguing with criminals\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Olawale Ajimotokan in Katsina and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nThe Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has warned the federal government that banditry has transformed into insurgency and that the hoodlums, who orchestrated the carnage had started to relocate from the regions to other parts of the country, hence, the need for drastic action to eliminate them.\n\nHe advised the federal government to adopt new security measures that would completely liquidate insurgents and bandits terrorising the country, particularly, the North West and North East zones, where his state falls.\n\nMasari, who spoke when he received the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed at the Government House, Katsina, added that bandits are relocating to the fringes of the forest to unleash terror on innocent citizens.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom experiences of other countries, you need to liquidate banditry and insurgency completely. I said it before let me repeat it again, the issue of banditry in Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, part of Niger and Kaduna States has no religious problem and tribal.\n\n\u201cSo, if you take whatever action nobody will complain to you on religious or tribal grounds. We are the same people same language, same culture and tradition. We have certainly became enemies of each other; the good ones on this part and the bad ones on the other part\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn everything there is collateral damage, even if you want to clean your room completely in the process you will lose something that you like. So, in dealing with these people of the forest there may be some collateral damages but we need to take action\u201d.\n\nHe, however, said North-west governors have reviewed the issues surrounding the failure of many efforts in order to curb banditry, lamenting that there are 150 bandits\u2019 camps in adjoining forests of Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna and Niger States operating independently.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cToday, in these forests of Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna going down to Niger, there are over 150 different camps of bandits each one operating independently\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Minister, Mohammed said the security measures adopted by the Masari-led government in combating banditry were yielding positive results.\n\nHe added that the efforts need to be trumpet in order to encourage security agencies and other stakeholders in the ongoing war against banditry and terrorism to do more in warding off the carnage.\n\nThe minister stated this in Katsina while in audience with Governor Masari and other top government officials to ascertain the security measures put in place by the governor in curbing insecurity.\n\nSharing this viewpoint, the House of Representatives, has also raised the alarm that bandits fleeing from military operations in Zamfara and Katsina States, had infiltrated and attacking other states in the zones, including Kano State.\n\nThis is as the Emir of Katsina, Alhaji Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, has condemned those calling for dialogue with bandits, declaring that the criminals do not deserve human rights.\n\nHowever, Masari, who spoke when receiving the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, at the Government House, Katsina, reiterated that bandits were relocating to the fringes of the forest to unleash terror on innocent citizens.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFrom experiences of other countries, you need to liquidate banditry and insurgency completely. I said it before, let me repeat it again, the issue of banditry in Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, part of Niger and Kaduna States, has no religious problem and tribal.\n\n\u201cSo, if you take whatever action, nobody will complaint to you on religious or tribal grounds.\n\nWe are the same people, same language, same culture and tradition. We have certainly become enemies of each other; the good ones on this part and the bad ones on the other part.\n\n\u201cIn everything, there is collateral damage, even if you want to clean your room completely in the process, you will lose something that you like. So, in dealing with the people of the forest, there may be some collateral damages, but we need to take action\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that the North West governors had reviewed the issues surrounding the failure of many efforts in order to curb banditry, lamenting that there were 150 bandit camps in adjoining forests of Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna and Niger States, operating independently.\n\nThe governor maintained that, \u201ctoday, in these forests of Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna right up to Niger, there are over 150 different camps of bandits, each one operating independently\u201d.\n\nMohammed, who spoke earlier, said the security measures adopted by the Masari-led government in combating banditry were yielding positive results.\n\nHe added that the efforts needed to be ramped up and security agencies and other stakeholders encouraged and appreciated in the ongoing war against banditry and terrorism, to do more in warding off the carnage.\n\n\u201cWe are not in any doubt that some of the measures you (Masari) embarked upon have started yielding fruits. However, it is unfortunate that the media is not giving same attention to the tune of events as it\u2019s being given to the activities of the bandits. We believe that these efforts desired to be trumpeted.\u201d\n\nAlso, on Tuesday, the House raised the alarm at plenary following the adoption of a motion by Hon. Haruna Dederi, on the need to take urgent measures to check frequent attacks by bandits on Rogo Local Government Area of Kano.\n\nThe lawmaker said Rogo and Karaye Local Government Areas shared borders with Katsina and Kaduna States, which for sometime have been bedeviled by the nefarious activities of armed bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the military operation against bandits in Zamfara and Katsina States, the bandits are now fleeing into other states, including Kano State,\u201d Dederi said.\n\nHe lamented that in the last few weeks, bandits had attacked towns and villages in Rogo, including Jajaye, Zarewa, RuwanBago, Bari, Falgore, Dutsen-Bari and Hawan \u2014Gwamna (Fulatan), where they kidnapped people, who were still mostly in their captivity and demanding several millions for their release.\n\nDederi, therefore, expressed worry that if measures were not immediately taken to stop the activities of bandits in Rogo Local Government Area and other border councils of Kano State, their nefarious activities could spread to other local places, thereby upsetting the relative peace being enjoyed in the state.\n\nConsequently, the House urged the federal government to set up a well equipped Joint Security Taskforce with the mandate to operate along the border lines between Katsina, Kaduna and Kano States, to address the frequent attacks by armed bandits in Rogo and other affected border councils.\n\nThe House also resolved that a similar joint security taskforce be set up by the government in Abia and Kogi to arrest the security situations in both states, while at the same time, urged the federal government to step up efforts to consolidate the gains recorded in the military operation against armed banditry by expanding the operation in a coordinated and simultaneous manner that would cover all other affected states and prevent the movement of the bandits.\n\nThe Emir of Katsina, while speaking during an interactive media session on insecurity co-organised by the Katsina State government and the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, kicked against the payment of ransom to bandits and accused those who carry out the unwholesome act of hiding behind human rights to commit crime.\n\n\u201cSome of the bandits have settled in our cities. They have started buying lands and are now building houses in our communities. Bandits can never repent. Though we are in a democracy, but bandits don\u2019t deserve to enjoy human rights that they are denying others,\u201d the Emir said.\n\nHe lauded Masari\u2019s decision to shut down telecommunication service in the state, ban the sale of petrol in jerry cans along border communities, close animal markets, ban the sale of fairly used motorcycles and close junction motor parks, saying the decision had improved security in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\n\n\nNigeria has raised $4 billion through Eurobonds, which was a reflection of investors\u2019 confidence in the economy.\n\nThe amount was raised after an intensive two days of virtual meetings with investors across the globe.\n\nIn a statement issued last night, the Debt Management Office (DMO) explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.\n\nIt said: \u201cThis exceptional performance has been described as, \u201cone of the biggest financial trades to come out of Africa in 2021\u201d and \u201can excellent outcome\u201d.\n\nAccording to the DMO, bids for the Eurobonds were received from investors in Europe and America, as well as Asia. There was also good participation by local investors.\n\nAccording to the statement, the size of the Order Book and the quality of investors demonstrates confidence in Nigeria.\n\nThe Eurobonds were issued in three tranches, details, namely seven years\u2013,$1.25 billion at 6.125 per cent per annum; 12 years -$1.5 billion at 7.375 per cent per annum as well as 30 years -$1.25 billion at 8.25 per annum\n\nThe long tenors of the Eurobonds and the spread across different maturities are well aligned with Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, 2020 \u20132023, the DMO said.\n\nIt stressed that since the Eurobonds were issued as part of the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the raising of $4 billion through Eurobonds\n\nprovides a significant amount of funds to finance projects in the Act, thus contributing to the implementation of the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nNigeria returned to the International Capital Market (ICM) three years after its last outing in 2018, when it floated a $2.5 billion aggregate Eurobonds under its Global Medium Term Note Programme.\n\nThe DMO had stated that in addition to providing funding to part-finance the deficit in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the issuance of the Eurobonds would benefits the country in many other strategic ways.\n\nAccording to the DMO, it would also bring about an inflow of foreign exchange, leading to an increase in external reserves to help support the naira exchange rate as well as Nigeria\u2019s sovereign rating.\n\nIt further explained that when Nigeria raised funds externally through Eurobonds, it freed up space in the domestic market for private sector and sub-national borrowers.\n\nThe debt management body stated, \u201cIn effect, it helps the sovereign not to crowd out other borrowers in the domestic market. The issuance of Eurobonds by Nigeria has opened up opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s corporate sector, notably banks, to issue Eurobonds to raise capital in the ICM.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The other people that you said \u2018third force\u2019, there was a time some people named their own political party Mega Political Party.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the day, the Mega Political Party never had a councilor, not to talk of an LG chairman. I want to say with all sense of responsibility that it is wrong.\n\n\u201cTo say that some people who had one way or the other been active participants in one political party or the other, but have failed woefully, coming around to say they are the ones that want to give third force to the country is a laughable idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI look at the dramatis personae that they were at the so-called Rescue Nigeria Project today. Tell me any of them that has not had any stint in one governance or the other and what has been the record in that regard. An assemblage of failed politicians, either elected or appointed, can\u2019t say that want third force movement for the country.\u201d",

          "text": "In June 2016, Ventures Platform launched as an innovation hub where tech enthusiasts, freelancers, startup founders, and professionals in Nigeria could meet, network, and co-create. The 1,200-square-meter hub in Abuja also served as a residential base for technology entrepreneurs on the continent selected to go through the VP accelerator programme.\n\nOver the past five years, Ventures Platform has changed its investment strategy from the accelerator model to become one of the leading early-stage funds in Africa while it spun off the innovation hub business, now managed by its subsidiary Ventures Park.\n\nWith the recent surge in fundraising, tech activity, and uptake of remote freelance jobs in Nigeria, Ventures Park has seen its community of active users nearly double from just over 100 in early 2021 to almost 200. In response to the increase, the company has launched a bigger campus, in Abuja, to provide greater support to its community.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria has the highest number of startups in Africa, according to findings by fDi Intelligence of Financial Times, in collaboration with Briter Bridges. As of August, a report by Disrupt Africa showed that Nigerian startups accounted for the biggest share of the $1.1 billion funding the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem had attracted this year.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, yet remote work shows no signs of going away. The social distancing rules, public gathering restrictions, and other lockdown measures that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced companies across the world to adopt remote work options to keep their businesses running.\n\nThat reality has also played out in Nigeria. While most people in the country still work from physical offices amid the health crisis, a few companies, such as Andela, Paystack, and Buycoins, have fully embraced the work-from-home idea.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the success or long-term adoption of remote work; such as Nigeria\u2019s inefficient power grid and irregular electricity supply as well as poor network connectivity and high internet costs. Nigeria ranks among countries with the most expensive data in the world.\n\nImage credit: Supplied by Ventures Park.\n\nA shared workspace at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja. Image credit: Supplied\n\nInnovation hubs and co-working spaces like the new Ventures Platform campus in Abuja are equipped with power and internet amenities that help freelancers work and entrepreneurs build better.\n\nThe new 2,000-sq-meter hub is located in Wuse II, Abuja, and has the capacity to accommodate over 200 people. It has facilities such as private and shared offices, dedicated desks, restaurants, and spaces designed to host events, conferences, fun activities, and more.\n\nOn the walls of the new campus are displays of several contemporary Nigerian art, which help create a stimulating and stress-free work environment. \u201cAt Ventures Park, we believe fundamentally that the space people work in influences the kind of work they produce,\u201d Kola Aina, founder of Ventures Platform told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThe Chill Zone. Image credit: Supplied.\n\nThe Chill Zone.

According to Aina, the \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 nature of the community is \u201creally important to creating a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Garden of V-Den.

Image credit: Supplied.\n\nBut why Abuja, and not Lagos, which is the epicentre of tech activity in Nigeria and where Ventures Platform has a \u201cvery active\u201d community? Oguchi explains that the company believes that talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn\u2019t evenly distributed.\n\n\u201cIf everyone continued to focus on Lagos, we\u2019d miss out on talents in other parts of Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose Abuja to cater to the community and build the ecosystem here and since we launched, we\u2019ve seen real progress in tech activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aina, Ventures Platform, since its launch, has been deliberate about wanting to provide opportunities in Abuja and the broader northern region of the country. \u201cMany years later, the ecosystem in Abuja and northern Nigeria has grown significantly and we\u2019re proud to have been part of that process.\u201d\n\nVentures Park offers different free and paid membership plans for people looking to make use of the campus, including low-cost options from as low as N1,500 ($2.7).\n\n\u201cWe understand how important it is for people to work with budgets,\u201d Oguchi said. \u201cCompanies can book a space for a two or three-hour meeting and we also have several membership plans for individuals and startups.\u201d\n\nThe training room at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is the flagship project of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 which was founded via a comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the principal aim of integrating Africa\u2019s market.\n\nRemarkably, AfCFTA is potentially the largest free trade area in the world with the capacity to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty by connecting over 1.3 billion people across 55 countries having a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of about US$3.4 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement establishing AfCFTA (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) was signed on 21st March 2018 but came into force on 30th May 2019 following the deposit of the instruments of ratification by 24 countries. As of April 19, 2021, 54 countries have signed the Agreement while 36 countries (including Nigeria) have deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson. Notably, trading under the AfCFTA Agreement officially commenced on January 1, 2021, subject to negotiations on protocols and instruments of trade.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement has three layers comprising the AfCFTA Agreement itself which serves as a framework agreement, the Protocols and the Annexes, Guidelines, and Schedules to the Protocols. The Agreement had two phases of negotiations. Under Phase I negotiations, the Protocols on Trade in Goods, Trade in Services, and Dispute Settlement entered into force concurrently with the AfCFTA Agreement. Phase II negotiations on the other hand will birth the Protocols on Investment, Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) and Competition Policy.\n\nIt was initially hoped that Phase II negotiations would be completed by January 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timeline has been delayed.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement (PDF) summarises AfCFTA\u2019s goals into eight objectives which includes, creating a single market for goods and services, creating a liberalised market for goods and services, contributing to the movement of capital and people and facilitating investment, creating a continental customs union, promoting sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development and gender equality, enhancing competitiveness of economies of State Parties and lastly resolving challenges of multiple memberships while expediting regional and continental integration process.\n\nBeyond the objectives listed in the Agreement, AfCFTA seeks to boost Africa\u2019s economic output to around $29 trillion by 2050 and increase intra-African trade by 52.3%.\n\nAfCFTA and the Nigerian IP market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Nollywood by Aimee Corrigan via Wikipedia Commons.\n\nIn recent times, the international and global economy has been driven by innovation, creativity, knowledge, and technology each of which is fundamentally supported by intellectual property (IP) and intellectual property rights (IPR).\n\nResearch has shown that countries with the largest economies are largely driven by IP. For developing countries, IP can be used to promote economic development by encouraging innovation. To encourage innovation, there must be an enabling environment safeguarded by a robust IP Policy that will ensure that creatives and investors recover the cost of investment and maximise the benefits generated from their innovations or creative work.\n\nA typical example is Nigeria which is home to a rich and dynamic creative sector, star among them the Nigerian film industry, also referred to as Nollywood. According to a 2016 IMF report, the Nigerian film industry currently accounts for \u20a6853.9 billion ($7.2 billion), or 1.42 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP and arguably the country\u2019s second-biggest source of employment after agriculture.\n\nNigeria\u2019s creative and innovative industries, however, stretch far beyond the film industry and include activities ranging from music and publishing to computer software and the manufacturing industries; each with enormous potential for growth.\n\nDespite the obvious economic possibilities in Nigeria\u2019s creative and innovative industries, Nigeria does not have an IP Policy to facilitate the mainstreaming of the economic value of IP into the government\u2019s National Economic Plan. Consequently, the value of IP and IPRs are not adequately recognised and harnessed by policymakers as an important tool for national development that needs to be promoted and protected.\n\nRemarkably, the facilitation of the flow of knowledge-rich goods and services across borders have become integral considerations in development and trade policy, which is the underpinning of World Trade Organisation\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\n\nThe Protocol on Intellectual Property Rights (\u201cIPR Protocol\u201d) which will be negotiated during Phase II of AfCFTA has vast possibilities for IP which must be explored. According to the World Bank, the IPR Protocol can serve as a catalyst for technology transfer, technology diffusion and the economic transformation of Africa\u2019s economy from one that is primarily resource-based, to one that is driven by knowledge, information, and ideas.\n\nWith AfCFTA, creatives and investors can have access to a larger market by extending the territorial recognition and protection of IP to its 54-signatory member territories. With an extended territorial recognition and protection of IP, creatives can exploit and maximise the value in IP by benefiting from the use of IP beyond its national territories. More so, the extension of territorial recognition and protection of IP will reduce the cost of registering and safeguarding IPR in territories of signatory members.\n\nAfCTA\u2019s extensive reach and influence can be utilised to achieve the standardisation and unification of IP policies in Africa by including a robust IP policy in the IPR Protocol which will be applicable in signatory members countries upon adoption. The IPR Protocol may also be used as a vehicle to establish a centralised and integrated IP registry (possibly with branches in member countries) for African Countries.\n\nIn conclusion, AfCFTA is a laudable initiative that can potentially expand Africa\u2019s fiscal opportunities and significantly improve the economy of African countries. However, to fully achieve its objective, AfCFTA must unlock the economic value of IP in Africa by ensuring that while goods and services are being transferred freely across African territories, the underlining IPRs are protected.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nTechpoint Build 2021\n\nNetflix\u2019s free plan in Kenya\n\nMore on Nigeria\u2019s CBDC\n\nCartona\u2019s Series A\n\nTechpoint Build is coming!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you imagine a large gathering of tech enthusiasts, industry experts, and early-stage startup founders? Close your eyes and see one that involves industry conversations, exhibitions, startup idea pitches, funding, and networking with tech-savvy people and key players. Well done! You\u2019ve successfully imagined Techpoint Build.\n\nTechpoint Build has been held annually since 2017 to connect key players in the African startup community. The 2021 edition promises to be nothing short of revolutionary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThemed The Next Frontier, this year\u2019s edition will focus on building frontiers that enable tech development for Africa and preparing ourselves to harness the opportunities across industries like edtech, healthtech, musictech, and fintech.\n\nWhat\u2019s more? This year\u2019s edition is set for January 22, 2022, and registration is free!!! Find more details here. And reserve your spot here.\n\nKenyans can now watch Netflix for free and without Ads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Netflix\n\nYes, you read right. US-based movie streaming platform, Netflix, announced on Monday that it had begun the rollout of a free Netflix plan for Kenyans. Is anyone thinking of relocating to Kenya yet?\n\nIt was announced in a blog post released on Monday, September 20, 2021. The platform\u2019s Director for Product Innovation, Cathy Conk, revealed that Android mobile phone users above 18 in the East-African country can now access one-quarter of movies and television shows on Netflix free of charge and without ads.\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t said. The blog post said nothing about how long this free plan would be available and whether plans are in the works to extend this offer to other markets. However, Conk hinted at the most likely reason for this offering: free subscribers can upgrade to a paid subscription to access the platform\u2019s full catalogue of movies and shows.\n\nSugar for ants; ants for sugar. Considering a September 2021 Statista report projecting that there\u2019d be a total of 2.6 million Netflix subscribers in Africa by the end of the year, this move is probably to increase sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s subscriber figures and, in the long-term, increase paying subscribers.\n\nViability?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to reliable, affordable, and constant power supply has continuously been a problem in sub-Saharan Africa for a long time, impairing economic growth. As the population in the region increases, the enormity of the problem becomes more evident.\n\nIn Energy in Africa Challenges and Opportunities by Manfred Hafner and Simone Tagliapietra Lucia de Strasser, in 2018, about 600 million people out of 1.07 billion in sub-Saharan Africa did not have access to electricity.\n\nWhile there are efforts to increase access to electricity, population growth outpaces these efforts.\n\nInterestingly, some parts of Africa have high connection rates. According to Afrobarometer, Egypt has a 100% connection rate, South Africa, 95%; and Nigeria, 90%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s high percentage access differs greatly from its 17% supply rate. This means that electrical connections to people\u2019s houses and businesses do not translate to regular power supply.\n\nSadly, in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the case is either a high connection rate with little supply or a low connection rate with adequate supply and sometimes neither. An example is Burundi, with less than 25% connection rate and a supply rate below 19%.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s population and need for economic growth increase, the need for a reliable and sustainable energy source also rises.\n\nIn its Energy Outlook 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Africa predicts that the continent\u2019s population will surpass China\u2019s by 2025, making it critical to meet its energy demands.\n\nConnecting 600 million people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZOLA Electric Co-Founders. Image source: Digest Africa\n\nAfrica\u2019s electricity problems are not new, and companies are continuously developing tech solutions to solve them.\n\nZOLA Electric is one such company. It started when American Co-founder, Xavier Helgesen, an American, went hitchhiking in Malawi.\n\nWhile in Malawi, Helgesen spent time with a family in a fishing village on the shores of Lake Malawi. After discovering that the family lit their home with kerosene lanterns, he had an epiphany and immediately decided to work on a solution to the continent\u2019s electricity problem.\n\nDuring his master\u2019s programme at the University of Oxford, England, Helgesen researched solar power. It was there he met two other Americans \u2014 Erica Mackey, who had worked in Tanzania, and Joshua Pierce, a renewable energy expert \u2014 with whom he co-founded ZOLA Electric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether they devised a plan to provide affordable solar solutions for Africans, and in 2012, they launched ZOLA Electric first as Off-Grid Electric in Tanzania.\n\nZOLA Electric\u2019s CEO, Bill Lenihan, tells Techpoint Africa that the drive to create the company came from the Co-founders passion \u201cto solve a big problem [since] 2.2 billion people across the planet do not have access to reliable energy and those people tend to be the ones that need it the most.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lenihan, ZOLA Electric is not a solar company but one that enables solar. He describes it as a company that creates digital energy where users and suppliers get real-time information about their energy consumption.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to bring affordable energy and clean energy, and solar does its job there. However, the bigger issue is unreliability in these markets, and by definition renewables are unreliable, so the other key need to solve this is storage.\u201d\n\nHarshit Chatur, a Senior Director at integrated power company, NRG Energy, corroborates Lenihan\u2019s claims, saying renewables are uncontrollable supply resources.\n\n\u201cWhen the sun isn\u2019t shining, solar panels do not produce energy. When the wind isn\u2019t blowing, turbines do not produce either.\u201d\n\nLenihan believes ZOLA stands out as not being just a backup solution to Africa\u2019s energy crisis but a primary solution.\n\nHe says the solutions mostly available across Africa and South-East Asia are backup solutions. He cites the example of a Lagos home that is connected to the grid but needs a backup generator and an inverter \u2014 a costly solution that cannot ensure constant power.\n\nIn contrast, ZOLA Electric creates smart batteries that manage all power sources. Everything essentially goes through the battery while it intelligently switches power sources.\n\nZOLA Electric has a product called Infinity that takes power from solar panels, power grids, and other power sources. It then uses an installed software to switch to the most readily available energy source while simultaneously storing energy.\n\nZOLA Electric\u2019s video demonstration shows that Infinity can detect changes in the environment if the power source is solar or power surges if the source is an electrical grid.\n\nLenihan describes it simply as an energy management system that works like a storage system but actually does more.\n\n\u201cIt takes data and manages it to whatever is the priority of that homeowner,\u201d he says.\n\nZOLA Electric sells its products through its partners, who, while serving as distributors, interact directly with customers.\n\nThey install the ZOLA Electric solutions and help with maintenance. Essentially, it\u2019s a business-to-business (B2B) model.\n\nJourney through the years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Digest Africa\n\nFor Lenihan, it has been a journey of building and pioneering new technology. Through the years, the company has learnt what is effective for the continent and what isn\u2019t.\n\nThe learning process began in Africa\u2019s rural areas, understanding what they truly needed and the most sustainable way to provide it.\n\n\u201cWe started with lights and phone chargers and then went on to power televisions. We moved to more urban on-grid settings where people wanted really productive use and big systems, so the energy apparatus became even more complex.\u201d\n\nDescribing it as a product journey, he admits that though there have been many mistakes, they\u2019ve also made significant progress.\n\nAfrica\u2019s energy market is quite complicated. Each country, city, and user has specific needs, and over the years, ZOLA Electric has worked on products so flexible that they address all those specific needs.\n\nIn addition to the journey of creating a flexible product, the company was simultaneously building a digital energy industry.\n\nAccording to Lenihan, the industry was new, and although they built alongside other companies such as M-Kopa, it is still a challenge forging an entire industry.\n\nHowever, the co-founders\u2019 passion, which is also evident in employees and partners, has consistently kept the company going. And Lenihan believes it will help the industry grow.\n\n\u201cWe need people who want to get it done.\u201d\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nTesla is currently the company\u2019s second-largest investor. This happened because California-based solar company, SolarCity, invested in ZOLA Electric \u201cabout five years ago,\u201d Lenihan clarifies.\n\nSolarCity was acquired by Tesla a few years later, making Tesla ZOLA Electric\u2019s second-largest shareholder.\n\nLenihan reveals what he proposes will become the distributed digital energy industry.\n\n\u201cI see a renewed focus by the world on energy equality and energy access, and I hope that the momentum that exists today for the world to support the emerging markets in building out an energy apparatus continues.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that distributed digital energy is going to be the solution for emerging markets.\u201d\n\nThe company currently provides power for over 1.5 million people in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Nigeria.\n\nWhile Lenihan claims ZOLA Electric creates primary energy solutions, they still depend on other energy sources.\n\nHe admits that the company\u2019s product set doesn\u2019t completely solve the problem, but in a few years, the company will develop one that addresses all concerns.\n\nThough he sees a bright future for the industry, he maintains it will not be easy.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be 2.2 billion people without access to reliable energy if it were easy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Insurers globally, including Nigeria, are seeing uptake in marine cargo business on the back of increased demand by pharmaceutical companies and institutions involved in importation of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMarine cargo insurance covers the risks of loss, damage, expense and liability of goods during transportation from one place to the other, either by air, water or land.\n\nA standard marine cargo policy covers all risk of physical loss or damage from any external cause while the goods and/or merchandise are in the ordinary course of transit, and this is expected to continue as rollout becomes critical with variants of the pandemic taking toll on countries.\n\nThe COVAX Facility announced in February that it was going to deliver around 90 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the African region in the first quarter of 2021, and committed to providing up to 600 million doses to the region by end-2021 to cover 20 percent of the population.\n\nNigeria in March received nearly 4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca), shipped via the COVAX Facility, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO.\n\nSupo Sogelola, executive director, Law Union & Rock Insurance plc, now Tangerine Insurance, confirmed in a telephone interview that Nigerian insurers had been involved in providing marine cargo insurance for import of COVID-19 vaccines into the country.\n\nAccording to Sogelola, there is a provision in the law that importation of cargo into the country must be insured by local insurers. \u201cSo, we have been part of the importation of COVID-19 vaccines, and this is expected to rise as states begin to place orders for the vaccines for their citizens.\n\nRead Also: Marine insurers call for safety actions as containership fire incident rises\n\n\u201cMy company is involved with other insurers,\u201dSogelola said.\n\nMeanwhile, experts at Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty (AGCS), with a subsidiary in Nigeria, and one of the insurers that have played big in the space, share their experience working with clients to ensure the safe transit of sensitive pharmaceuticals.\n\nDamon Finneran, senior Allianz Marine Risk Consultant,and Brian McClintock, Pharma Global Practice Leader and Cargo AGCS, in a question and answer response addresse the distribution process, some of the inherent risks, what commercial insurance covers, how the COVID-19 vaccine distribution differs from other pharmaceutical distributions and what the pharmaceutical insurance renewal market might look like.\n\nAccording to them, Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty has a number of assureds in the pharmaceutical industry ranging from the manufactures to the distribution of vaccines globally.\n\n\u201cA successful vaccine distribution process in our mind starts with the transportation of the raw materials \u2014 Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) \u2014 that make up the vaccine all the way to the point of injection into the individual receiving the dose of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cOur goal as an insurer of this cold chain from start to finish is to have no loss of product as a result of temperature deviations, security breaches or simply physical damage during transit,\u201d according to Allianz Global.\n\nTo the experts, the logistics and supply chain process of a vaccine are substantial. This can involve multiple methods of transit and storage ranging from specialty integrated transport providers that move ultra-cold products that can be fragile during transit and requiring a narrow temperature range that it ships within before it begins to degrade the potency of the vaccine.\n\nFinneran and McClintock say additional methods of transit will include trucking in conjunction with air, and with more stable vaccines, also by ocean.\n\n\u201cThe primary concerns with the transport of vaccines are excursions (temperature deviations) during transit. Our global loss prevention team works with our assureds to minimise any excursions during transit. We have table top discussions identifying contingency plans if things do not go as planned during transit. Our loss prevention team makes themselves available any time to work with our assured and brokers to \u2018save\u2019 shipments that may become out of their temperature specification while delayed in transit,\u201d they say.\n\nOn how the COVID-19 vaccine distribution differs from other pharmaceutical distribution, they say the company is involved with ultra-cold, 2-8 degree C and ambient shipments on a regular basis, the current COVID-19 shipments challenge us with their volume in conjunction with the strain the movement of the vaccines will put on the temperature controlled transportation industry through to last mile distribution.\n\nOn how long the COVID-19 business will last, they note, \u201cWe expect pharmaceutical type business/accounts renewals to be challenging in 2021. The marine cargo market is expected to continue to push for rate/premium increases and/or increased retentions and/or reduction in terms in the overall market but would expect that pharmaceutical and/or temperature sensitive type goods to be under greater scrutiny.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria must have its rather successful Eurobond sale of Tuesday to thank for partly overshadowing its woeful performance in the 2021 \u201cwhere to invest in Africa\u201d report where the continent\u2019s biggest economy did not qualify to be listed in the ranking of the top 10 countries.\n\nThe report was released by Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) on Tuesday, the same day leading investors from around major markets of the world were snapping up the $4 billion on offer by Nigeria, leading to a massive oversubscription categorised as one of the best things out of Africa in 2021.\n\nIn the \u2018Where to invest in Africa\u2019 ranking, Egypt was placed first and followed by Morocco and South Africa in the second and third place, respectively.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria raises $4bn Eurobond as foreign investors oversubscribe four times\n\nRwanda, Botswana and Ghana followed in the pecking order while Mauritius, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya and Tanzania made up the remaining places.\n\nIn the same ranking for 2020, Nigeria placed seventh but this year the country is completely missing from the top 10, a mark of how the investment climate in Africa\u2019s most populous country had deteriorated in 12 months.\n\nDaniel Kavishe, Africa economist at RMB, said Wednesday that this year\u2019s \u2018where to invest\u2019 report was also impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as the significant disruption in cross-border payment to suppliers in a number of key markets that were ranked.\n\nA key indicator this year was fiscal score measuring the size, nature and efficiency of government fiscal measures to strengthen resilience in the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown in major markets across Africa.\n\nWhile Nigeria is tipped by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to grow by 2.5 percent in 2021, South Africa, the continent\u2019s second largest economy, is projected to expand 4 percent. Egypt and Morocco are projected to expand by 2.8 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.\n\nJohnson Chukwu, managing director/CEO, Cowry Asset Management Limited, says the African countries that made it in the top 10 ranking have a stable socio-economic environment, stable leadership and have invested in infrastructure and their economies are growing.\n\nChukwu notes that Nigeria is not among that group as its economy has been struggling since the past six years, and in that period, Nigeria has suffered two recessions that have seen GDP per capita decline every year since 2015, causing poverty to deepen.\n\nAccording to Chukwu, investors go to countries that are free of insecurity and have strong legal systems. He is worried that investors in Nigeria find it difficult to repatriate their investment returns.\n\nInvestment inflows into Nigeria have dwindled since the economic recession in 2016, a sign of the country\u2019s weakening allure to foreign investors. However, it did raise a $4 billion Eurobond on Tuesday that was oversubscribed four times as bids totalled $12 billion compared with the $3 billion that was initially planned.\n\nRead Also: Why Nigeria may buck trend of record-low interest rates on African Eurobonds\n\n\u201cThat the Eurobond was oversubscribed is not a measure of foreign investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigerian economy,\u201d a Lagos-based investment banker states.\n\n\u201cThe fact is Nigeria has never defaulted on a Eurobond payment, and what matters to bond investors are not necessarily the economic fundamentals but Nigeria\u2019s ability to repay the loan, which it easily can,\u201d the investment banker says.",

There have been several attempts and one of the promises I made during my electioneering was that before leaving office, I was going to make Edo like modern cities in the world, making Edo people experience a retail shopping mall in the state.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the project is a public-private partnership and when completed, the government would sell its shares to Edo people.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe are very pleased and happy with our partners, Persianas. We thank the chairman, who built the first Shoprite in Nigeria. For our administration, it\u2019s all about partnerships. This is what we call a classic public-private partnership between the government and the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t intend to keep any interest.

Our role is to ensure and enable transactions like this to take place in the state.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cWe are bringing back industries and transactions of this nature to the state. We are stimulating investment into the state and when the businesses are set up, the government will withdraw because it has no business in running businesses.\n\n\u201cEdo has a unique location, fertile land and lots of mineral resources. We are repositioning the state to attract investors to take advantage of these opportunities; we are making sure our investment climate is friendly, attractive and supportive.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chairman of Persianas Nigeria Limited, Mr. Tayo Amusan said, \u201cWe are excited to bring Shoprite to Edo State. We have the experience to do business in the state, as we have done JARA stores in conjunction with the Edo State Government.\u201d\n\nAmusan expressed satisfaction with the developmental strides of the Obaseki-led administration, commending the governor for prioritizing the welfare and livelihoods of Edo people.\n\n...",

          "title": "Lagos Senator Blames Nigeria\u2019s Debt Burden On Past Military, PDP Govts",
          "text": "Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola (APC, Lagos West), has alleged that a huge part of Nigeria\u2019s total debt profile roughly estimated at N35trillion naira were incurred by past administrations dating back to the military era.\n\nAdeola made the disclosure on Wednesday during the consideration of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper at the Senate plenary.\n\nHe disclosed that majority of the loans being repaid presently by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration were ones accumulated from the times of the military to those of the PDP administration under Ex-Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan, between 1999 and 2015.\n\nSenator Adeola disclosed this when asked by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, to make clarifications on concerns raised by lawmakers, particularly over Nigeria\u2019s debt profile during deliberation on the report of the Joint Committees on Finance; Local and Foreign Debts; Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); Downstream Petroleum Sector and Gas on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Framework.\n\nResponding, Adeola said, \u201cThe borrowing you are saying is accumulated borrowing. It is not a borrowing of this administration alone, it is a borrowing that stems from the days of the military to the days when the Democratic dispensation started.\n\n\u201cIt is an accumulated loan, it is not a loan that says that it is the current administration of President Buhari that has borrowed.\n\n\u201cIt is a loan that has been borrowed by the previous administration \u2013 the Obasanjo, the Jonathan, the Yar\u2019Adua of this world.\n\n\u201c[And] since the business of government is a continuum, the President of the day has no choice but to continue to pay back all these loans that have been borrowed by the previous administrations.\n\n\u201cMore than three-quarter of these loans you\u2019re seeing were borrowed from the previous administrations, and we are paying back \u2013 we are doing what is supposed to be done, the way it is supposed to be done.\n\n\u201cSo, when my colleague said that for every sixty-seven naira of any loan that was borrowed, we are using to pay, he should know that more than sixty naira of it are loans borrowed by previous administration. And that is where we are.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks blamed Nigeria\u2019s economic predicament on the failure of past governments to prioritize the provision of critical infrastructure.\n\nAccording to him, the situation has left the present administration with no other viable option but to seek external borrowing to fund capital expenditures in the national budget.\n\n\u201cI believe that we have learnt so much from the clarification which the Chairman of the Joint Committee gave.\n\n\u201cLet me say this, when you don\u2019t make hay while the sun shines, this is the kind of thing you face.\n\n\u201cWhen we had plenty of money, we didn\u2019t prioritize the construction of infrastructure in Nigeria. We wasted our resources when we had much.\n\n\u201cToday, we realize we need to construct infrastructure because that is the only way to develop the country. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the kind of resources we had before.\n\n\u201cNow, our options are very limited because our revenues are limited. I agree with all our colleagues who said we need to reduce borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe Committee on Finance particularly has been doing a good job of ensuring that Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), particularly Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs), contribute more to the national coffers than they normally do.\n\n\u201c[And] that is why we have more resources today, more revenues or funds in the Independent Revenue Contribution.\n\n\u201cOur Committees need to do a lot of oversight, because when we don\u2019t do the oversight, we also come here annually to this kind of thing of non-remittance of funds.\n\n\u201cCommittees are supposed to know how much a Ministry or Agency of Government receives and contributes or remit to the treasury. We actually need to up our game in the area of oversight.\u201d\n\nBaring his thoughts on the raging controversy of Value Added Tax remittance to the Federal Government, the Senate President said, \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing wrong in continuing with VAT as part of our revenues, because there\u2019s no finality in any judgement yet and, therefore, we shouldn\u2019t confuse our system.\n\n\u201cUntil there\u2019s such a very clear cut definite judgement by the Supreme Court, we should go ahead with VAT as part of the resources available to us.\n\n\u201cI want to also challenge the Federal Inland Revenue Service, the Customs and other major revenue collecting or generating agencies, that they need to sit up.\n\n\u201cThey need to bring in more revenues because we have given them all the support that is necessary. The Federal Inland Revenue has received a lot of support from this National Assembly, particularly the Senate, and they have no reason not to improve on their collection.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on remittance of generated revenues by Agencies of Government, Lawan charged the relevant Senate Committees to identify MDAs with sufficient revenue earnings to fund their operations.\n\nHe explained that doing so would create grounds for the exclusion of such MDAs from the national budget, as well as cut down on government\u2019s annual expenditure.\n\n\u201cOther agencies of government get IGRs and they don\u2019t remit. In fact, they wait for us to give them allocations or appropriations.\n\n\u201cI think it is high time our Committee on Finance or any other related Committees to look at those agencies that we should stop funding through the annual budget, because what they collect is more than enough for them to operate, and in fact they should actually contribute to the national treasury\u201d the Senate President said.",

          "text": "Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola (APC, Lagos West), has alleged that a huge part of Nigeria\u2019s total debt profile roughly estimated at N35trillion naira were incurred by past administrations dating back to the military era.\n\nAdeola made the disclosure on Wednesday during the consideration of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper at the Senate plenary.\n\nHe disclosed that majority of the loans being repaid presently by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration were ones accumulated from the times of the military to those of the PDP administration under Ex-Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan, between 1999 and 2015.\n\nSenator Adeola disclosed this when asked by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, to make clarifications on concerns raised by lawmakers, particularly over Nigeria\u2019s debt profile during deliberation on the report of the Joint Committees on Finance; Local and Foreign Debts; Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); Downstream Petroleum Sector and Gas on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Framework.\n\nResponding, Adeola said, \u201cThe borrowing you are saying is accumulated borrowing. It is not a borrowing of this administration alone, it is a borrowing that stems from the days of the military to the days when the Democratic dispensation started.\n\n\u201cIt is an accumulated loan, it is not a loan that says that it is the current administration of President Buhari that has borrowed.\n\n\u201cIt is a loan that has been borrowed by the previous administration \u2013 the Obasanjo, the Jonathan, the Yar\u2019Adua of this world.\n\n\u201c[And] since the business of government is a continuum, the President of the day has no choice but to continue to pay back all these loans that have been borrowed by the previous administrations.\n\n\u201cMore than three-quarter of these loans you\u2019re seeing were borrowed from the previous administrations, and we are paying back \u2013 we are doing what is supposed to be done, the way it is supposed to be done.\n\n\u201cSo, when my colleague said that for every sixty-seven naira of any loan that was borrowed, we are using to pay, he should know that more than sixty naira of it are loans borrowed by previous administration. And that is where we are.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks blamed Nigeria\u2019s economic predicament on the failure of past governments to prioritize the provision of critical infrastructure.\n\nAccording to him, the situation has left the present administration with no other viable option but to seek external borrowing to fund capital expenditures in the national budget.\n\n\u201cI believe that we have learnt so much from the clarification which the Chairman of the Joint Committee gave.\n\n\u201cLet me say this, when you don\u2019t make hay while the sun shines, this is the kind of thing you face.\n\n\u201cWhen we had plenty of money, we didn\u2019t prioritize the construction of infrastructure in Nigeria. We wasted our resources when we had much.\n\n\u201cToday, we realize we need to construct infrastructure because that is the only way to develop the country. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the kind of resources we had before.\n\n\u201cNow, our options are very limited because our revenues are limited. I agree with all our colleagues who said we need to reduce borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe Committee on Finance particularly has been doing a good job of ensuring that Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), particularly Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs), contribute more to the national coffers than they normally do.\n\n\u201c[And] that is why we have more resources today, more revenues or funds in the Independent Revenue Contribution.\n\n\u201cOur Committees need to do a lot of oversight, because when we don\u2019t do the oversight, we also come here annually to this kind of thing of non-remittance of funds.\n\n\u201cCommittees are supposed to know how much a Ministry or Agency of Government receives and contributes or remit to the treasury. We actually need to up our game in the area of oversight.\u201d\n\nBaring his thoughts on the raging controversy of Value Added Tax remittance to the Federal Government, the Senate President said, \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing wrong in continuing with VAT as part of our revenues, because there\u2019s no finality in any judgement yet and, therefore, we shouldn\u2019t confuse our system.\n\n\u201cUntil there\u2019s such a very clear cut definite judgement by the Supreme Court, we should go ahead with VAT as part of the resources available to us.\n\n\u201cI want to also challenge the Federal Inland Revenue Service, the Customs and other major revenue collecting or generating agencies, that they need to sit up.\n\n\u201cThey need to bring in more revenues because we have given them all the support that is necessary. The Federal Inland Revenue has received a lot of support from this National Assembly, particularly the Senate, and they have no reason not to improve on their collection.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on remittance of generated revenues by Agencies of Government, Lawan charged the relevant Senate Committees to identify MDAs with sufficient revenue earnings to fund their operations.\n\nHe explained that doing so would create grounds for the exclusion of such MDAs from the national budget, as well as cut down on government\u2019s annual expenditure.\n\n\u201cOther agencies of government get IGRs and they don\u2019t remit. In fact, they wait for us to give them allocations or appropriations.\n\n\u201cI think it is high time our Committee on Finance or any other related Committees to look at those agencies that we should stop funding through the annual budget, because what they collect is more than enough for them to operate, and in fact they should actually contribute to the national treasury\u201d the Senate President said.",
          "summary": "It is not a borrowing of this administration alone, it is a borrowing that stems from the days of the military to the days when the Democratic dispensation started.\n\u201cIt is an accumulated loan, it is not a loan that says that it is the current administration of President Buhari that has borrowed.\n\u201cIt is a loan that has been borrowed by the previous administration \u2013 the Obasanjo, the Jonathan, the Yar\u2019Adua of this world.\nAnd that is where we are.\u201dThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks blamed Nigeria\u2019s economic predicament on the failure of past governments to prioritize the provision of critical infrastructure.\n\u201c[And] that is why we have more resources today, more revenues or funds in the Independent Revenue Contribution.",

But because people are senseless they tend to sabotage or go on that kind of wanton destruction. In spite of the gloom, the Senator said it members could not help but notice the scale of industrialization undertaken by the governor.\n\n\u201cDespite all these, we have seen the kind of development through industrialization under your watch and of course, we are not surprised because you are a man of intellectual capacity.\u201d\n\nThanking the committee for its evaluation tour of the state, Governor Ayade who described the attacks as wilful, vicious and mindless, lamented that \u201cfor the little intellectual money we have struggled to be able to push in value, some people came in and destroyed everything.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have people on video while destroying saying: \u2018Let\u2019s see how Cross River will be boasting about their Tinapa, let\u2019s see how they will be talking of this Industrial park\u2019. Truly, the highest destruction in the whole country was in Cross River, as most of our assets including our piles and pylon factory which you could not go because it is in far away Akamkpa were destroyed.\n\n\u201cIt is the major factory that will build the sub-structure for the deep seaport. So there was somebody behind the strategic attack because even the looting they did was just too much. All the persons arrested in connection with the violence happen to be non-indigenes. When we did door to door search, the people in whom we found some of our looted assets were linked to a certain ethnic nationality. So, for us as a state, it is like we lost a whole generation.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Cross River State during the #EndSARS was something I will say was not natural because when the protest started across the country, Calabar and indeed, Cross River was totally at peace.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cI therefore, took proactive steps by putting out a broadcast offering scholarships to all indigenes of the state in the Cross River State University of Technology, including announcing massive programs of incentives. I spoke to the youths, encouraged them to be cautious that Cross River State was the state with the least federal allocation. I told them that the destruction would hurt us as a state.\n\n\u201cI was on TV and radio, I addressed them through these mediums, we had several meetings with the service commanders to forestall anything that could go wrong but we also saw on social media, people asking why was Cross River so peaceful while all our neighbouring states were burning? It was almost as if somebody was actually pushing an agenda about why should Calabar have peace?\n\n\u201cAnd so if you check the systemic destruction you will know that it was orchestrated. In one of our security meetings we were told that there was a team of people who were going to come through the waters to come and attack us because they think it was an embarrassment that everywhere else was burning except Calabar.\u201d",

Local and Foreign Debts; Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); Downstream Petroleum Sector and Gas on Wednesday.\n\nThe Joint Committee report was presented by Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola (APC, Lagos West), who chairs the Finance Committee.\n\nThe chamber during consideration of the report gave its nod to the Federal Government\u2019s revenue projection of N8.36 trillion; and proposed expenditure of N13.98 trillion.\n\nAccordingly, it also approved the daily crude oil production of 1.88mbpd, 2.23mbpd, and 2.22mbpd for 2022, 2023 and 2024, particularly \u201cin view of average 1.93mbpd over the last 3 years and the fact that a very conservative oil output benchmark has been adopted for the medium term in order to ensure greater budget realism\u201d.\n\nThe Senate in its recommendations approved the Benchmark oil price of USD$57 per barrel; adopted the Exchange Rate of N410.15/US$ by the Executive for 2022-2024; and gave its nod to the projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 4.20%; as well as 13% inflation rate.\n\nIn addition, the chamber approved fiscal deficit of N5.62 trillion; new borrowings of N4.89 trillion \u2013 an amount which includes Foreign and Domestic borrowing \u2013 subject to the provision of details of the borrowing plan to the National Assembly.\n\nThe Senate also approved other parameters such as Statutory transfers totaling N613.4 billion; Debt Service estimate of N3.12 trillion; Sinking Fund to the tune of N292 billion; Pension, Gratuities and Retirees Benefits of N567 billion.\n\nOut of the Aggregate Federal Government\u2019s Expenditure of N13.98 trillion, the upper chamber approved the sum of N6.12 trillion for Total Recurrent (Non-debt); N3.47 trillion as Personnel Cost for Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs); N3.26 trillion for Capital Expenditure (exclusive transfers); N350 billion Special Intervention (Recurrent); and N10 billion for Special Intervention (Capital).\n\nThe upper chamber in its report recommended that the Fiscal deficit estimate of N5.62 trillion also be sustained due to the Federal Government\u2019s conservative approach to target setting and its determination to improve collection efficiency of major revenue generating agencies.\n\nIt further called on the Salaries and Wages Commission to review the salary structure of all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), in other to come up with a new salary structure that will reflect the true financial position of the Agencies.\n\nThe chamber also demanded a continuous review of the Fiscal Responsibility Act to ensure that all revenues are remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) as at when due, in order to curtail frivolous deductions and diversion of funds by the MDAs.\n\nIt further maintained that all laws relating to mining businesses be reviewed as a matter of urgency, to ensure upward review of rates applied to royalties, ground rent and licenses renewal of all mining companies operating in Nigeria to ensure transparency in the collection of revenue by relevant agencies, as well as recommend stringent sanctions in proposed new laws to address illegal mining.\n\nThe Senate amid its recommendations also called on the Nigeria Customs Service to accelerate the process of installing scanners at all ports across the country to curb the issues of smuggling and underpayment of custom duties on imported goods which has resulted in huge loss of revenue to the government.\n\nIt also charged the Federal Government to urgently implement the Petroleum Industry Act recently assented to by the President in order to curtail the problems of smuggling and round-tripping of petroleum products imported into the country.\n\nIn addition, the chamber recommended that the proposed budget of Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs) be reviewed upward to show the reflection of their capabilities to generate more revenue as a result of the findings of the Joint Committee.\n\nConsequently, it further recommended that the offices of the Accountant General (AGF), Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) and Fiscal Responsibility Commission be strengthened in the area of staffing and proper funding of its activities to ensure optimal performance of their duties in order to adequately monitor the remittances of all government revenue.\n\nThe chamber posited that the Act establishing some MDAs such as \u2013 Nigeria Investment Promotion Council (NIPC), National Lottery Trust Fund Act, Bank of Industry Act, Bank of Agriculture Act, Energy Commission Act and Nigeria Nuclear Regulatory Commission \u2013 if reviewed and amended as a matter of urgency, would assist to generate more revenue to the coffers of government.\n\nIt also recommended that the Federal Government budget be reviewed and purged of some agencies with demonstrated capacity to stand on their own without any recourse to Federal Government of Nigeria budget.\n\nThe chamber gave example of such agencies to include the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, Zaria.",

Komolafe is to serve for a period of five years. The position is also renewable once for another five years according to the Act.\n\nAlso, as a fallout of the PIA implementation, the President has approved the appointment of Mr. Sarki Auwalu as the Chief Executive Officer for the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nIf confirmed, Auwalu who is the current Director/Chief Executive Officer of the DPR, would serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Authority for five years. The position is also renewable once for another 5 years.\n\nThe PIA requires the confirmation of the Senate for the position of the Heads of the Authority and the Commission.\n\nPlatforms Africa provides insight into the activities of th\u00e8 NURC as \u201cnew DPR.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC) that would be headed by Komolafe will be involved in granting of new licences and the approval of assignments of licence interests.\n\nThe PIA also provides for the establishment of the Commission to oversee the regulation of upstream petroleum operations in the country.\n\nPlatforms Africa reports that the new head, Komolafe, will be supported by six Executive Commissioners to handle the day-to- day administration of the Commission.\n\nThe Commission will also take over the current functions of the Department for Petroleum Resources (DPR), with respect to the regulation of technical, operational, commercial and environmental activities associated with upstream petroleum operations.\n\nLike in the upstream, the regulation for midstream and downstream, Platforms Africa reports, will also take a fresh perspective.\n\nFor the Authority, the PIA provides that it would regulate the midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the country.\n\nAs Chief Executive, Auwalu will be supported by seven Executive Directors to handle the day-to-day administration of the Authority.\n\nThe Authority will, according to Platforms Africa, take over the current functions of the DPR, with respect to the regulation of technical and commercial activities in the downstream and midstream petroleum operations.\n\nFurthermore, the Authority will be saddled with the responsibilities of providing pricing and tariff frameworks for natural gas in midstream and downstream gas operation.\n\nIt will also provide pricing Tarrif for petroleum products based on fair market basis, thus, absorbing the current responsibilities and functions of the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency.",
          "summary": "The President signed the Act into law last month, creating the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC), which will take over most of the upstream regulatory functions of the Department of Petroleum Resources, so replacing DPR as a primary regulator.\nThe PIA also calls for the establishment of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), which will be in charge of overseeing the country\u2019s midstream and downstream petroleum operations.\nThe PIA also provides for the establishment of the Commission to oversee the regulation of upstream petroleum operations in the country.\nThe Commission will also take over the current functions of the Department for Petroleum Resources (DPR), with respect to the regulation of technical, operational, commercial and environmental activities associated with upstream petroleum operations.\nFor the Authority, the PIA provides that it would regulate the midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the country.",

          "title": "How Felistas Foundation supports indigent students -NigPilot",
          "text": "While the super-rich in Nigeria who had stolen enough by manipulating loopholes in the public and private sector to send their wards to the best schools in Europe and America to prepare them for the ever dynamic world are doing that with impunity, the families of the downtrodden are sentenced to the public schools that educationists and policymakers said are in comatose, writes our correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\n\u201cEducation is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today\u201d. \u2013 Malcolm X\n\nThe aforesaid quote by an African-American Muslim minister, human rights activist, and spokesman for the Nation of Islam until 1964, Mr. Malcolm X succinctly captured the philanthropic focus of Felistas Foundation\u2019s supports to indigent pupils of the agrarian community in Nsukka local government area of Enugu State\n\nRegrettably, the era of the social stratification that classified Nigerian society into three strata, and substrata in-between is far from the current reality.\n\nAccording to sociological findings, society is divided into three groupings, vis vis \u201cUpper class\u201d, \u201cMiddle class,\u201d and \u201cLower class\u201d.\n\nThe upper class according to scholars is divided into, upper and upper-lower while the lower class also has upper lower and lower-lower.\n\nRegrettably, these stratifications have been eroded by current reality as the structure had collapsed into what is known today as the super-rich and the poor.\n\nHowever, while the super-rich are now enjoying the status hitherto enjoyed by the only middle class, the lower class still maintain its original stratification of uper lower and lower lower, while the middle class has fizzled away.\n\nIt is nonetheless, instructive to explain the sociological concept uper lower and lower lower. When a family is classified to belong to uper lower, it means that the family have the capacity to navigate the basic human needs of food, shelter and clothing to even sending their kids to school to prepare them for the future.\n\nUnfortunately, those that fall within the lower lower strata are more or less confined to the circle of poverty as the status of poverty is automatic to them by birth.\n\nThose born into this class have little or no hope of moving out of poverty except by devine intervention.\n\nScholars in sociology explained further, \u201cIt takes the grace of God for a Child born into the strata to escape from the circle of poverty. This is because it is impossible, humanly speaking but being that there is nothing that is impossible with God, we made bold to say that a child born into this strata can escape from the circle by divine intervention\u201d.\n\nAdding flesh to the concept of \u201cdivine intervention,\u201d the scholars said that there is \u201csocial mobility\u201d in social stratification.\n\nSocial mobility they explained is the process where by a man or family moves from upper class to middle or lower class or vise versa.\n\nThey added that there are factors that facilities these mobility. The factors include level of income, education and and occupation. The scholars further argued that the type of job a man does is dependent on his level of education and that also determine his income at end of the month.\n\n\u201cIf a man is well educated, it influences the kind of job he does and the kind of job a man does determines his income. Therefore everything boils down to education.\n\nGiving future explanation to the divine intervention concept, the scholars, explained that unless a child born into the lower lower class can only escape poverty if a school, church, multilateral organizations, good spirited individual, or a foundation give scholarship to a child from this type of family, he is doomed to poverty.\n\nIt is however, on the premise of the foregoing that a journalist, Ikem Okuhu, has donated a total of 8,000 exercise books to 1,577 primary school pupils in the seven primary schools in Nkpunano, Nsukka, in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.\n\nChief Okuhu in a statement said that the donation which is the third since the journalist\u2019s family launched a foundation known as Felistas Foundation three years ago in memory of their mother, Mrs. Felistas Ugwu, brings the total of exercise books donated to schools in the area to 18,000, adding that the donation is aimed at providing at least five exercise books to each of the pupils in the benefiting schools.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s donation, which had the Education Secretary of Nsukka Local Government Area, Mrs. Jane Asadu, in attendance also witnessed the donation of 2,000 biros and another 2,000 pencils from a community leader, Chief Ignatius Ugwu in support of the project,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSpeaking during the handing over ceremony, held at the Community Primary School, Nguru Nsukka, Ikem Okuhu, explained that the donation was designed to provide relief for the poor families who struggle to provide basic stationery for their children and wards in the public school system in the area.\n\nOkuhu, who is also a public relations practitioner, said the challenges faced by parents in the education of their children has continued to bother him and his family, lamenting that the continued economic downturn in the country has been having adverse impacts on the ability of parents to provide for the education of children.\n\nGoing down memory lane, he said, \u201cMy family has committed to the educational intervention as a means of sustaining the memory of our mother, who, in her lifetime, made feeding the poor in the community her major preoccupation.\n\n\u201cWhen our mother was alife, she made providing for her neighbours, especially the poor in the community her major task. Our family was such that, as hard as things was, food was considered something to share with each and everyone. As a means of sustaining this legacy, we decided in 2018 to make this donation annually, knowing how much poor parents struggle to get their children through primary education\u201d.\n\nHe also expressed delight that since the intervention began three years ago, school enrollments in the area has been on the increase and called on other public spirited individuals and groups to join in the efforts towards revitalizing the public schools in the state.\n\nOn her part, the Local Government Education Secretary, Mrs. Jane Asadu, commended the family for the initiative and urged other people to join hands with the state government in the drive to improve the fortunes of public schools in the state.\n\nAsadu commended the state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for his steadfast commitment towards the revitalization of education at all levels in the state, saying the governor had since he assumed office in 2015, rebuilt hundreds of classroom blocks in all parts of the state.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has been consistent in revitalizing the school system since he assumed office. His attention has especially been on the primary school system and all over the state, he has continued to provide modern infrastructure in our schools and efforts such as this one will go a long way in supporting his efforts along this line,\u201d she stated.\n\nShe also commended the Chairman of Enugu State Universal Basic Education Board (ENSUBEB), Mr Ikeje Asogwa for all his efforts in lifting the infrastructure fortunes of primary schools in the state.\n\nAlso speaking on the occasion, community leader and Chairman of Nguru Nsukka Development Union, Chief Ignatius Ugwu, appreciated the gesture of the journalist and pledged his support and those of other leading community leaders towards the revitalization of the primary schools in the area.\n\nMr. Ugwu extolled the virtues of the late matriarch of the Okuhu family for the exemplary life she lived and urged the people of the community to strive towards leaving a lasting legacy, especially such that would leave lasting impacts long after they had passed on.\n\nIt is on the premise of this to that I confidently conclude with the words of a medieval Sephardic Jewish philosopher who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars of the Middle Ages, Maimonides, \u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\u201d.",

          "text": "The resurgence of the military junta in the West African sub-region is not only reprehensible, anti-democratic and development but anti-people and disgraceful writes our Diplomatic correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nIn recent times, Mali, Niger, the Republic of Guinea , and a host of others have come under the sledgehammer of the military establishment in these countries following an inordinate attempts by the civil authorities to extend their stay in office.\n\nThough the attempted coup in the Niger Republic was not directly linked to an attempt by the outgone civilian administration to extend its reign, but observers said that the attempt was not unconnected with the effort by the outgone regime to subvert the will of the people at the poll.\n\nIt is however, regrettable to note that the solidarity enjoyed by these selfish leaders who want to perpetuate selves in government Infinitum by other leaders in the sub region under the aegis of ECOWAS is responsible for their boldness in always tinkering with the constitution of their respective states to legitimize their inordinate quest for power.\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has been playing outreach with its double standard on the issue under scrutiny.\n\nFor instance, the same ECOWAS that would maintain defending silence when these parochial and selfish leaders initiates constitutional review process to allow them contest elections after serving out their constitutionally allowed terms of office would move in to sanction the military when they move in to rescue their country from the clutches of one man\u2019s inordinate ambition.\n\nTo call a spade a spade, the Economic States of West African States (ECOWAS), has not lived up to its true calling as available data reveals that it has continued to tilt toward supporting those lawless and recalcitrant President within the sub region that had altered their constitution with the view to continue in office perpetually.\n\nTruth be told, what is it that these sit tight Presidents want to achieve in office that they were unable to achieve within their constitutionally allowed terms of office to warrant an extension.\n\nThe earlier that the relevant organs of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) begin to resist attempt by incumbent presidents to amend the constitution with a view to extend their tenure through the back, the more the coup in the sub sub region would escalates.\n\nBut in all honesty, is the military in the sub region actually truncating democracy as ECOWAS and other multilateral organizations and world leaders would want the public to believe or the military are up in arm to halt the emergence of tyrants with the support of western powers to protect their economic interests in the affected states?\n\nAn objective attempt to the above questions favours the later as the military in the region is not necessarily interested in partisan politics or want to distort democracy but is not just comfortable seeing some despots and unbridled tyrants and dictators raping the democratic process in a bid to continue in office perpetually.\n\nOnly recently, the Authority of Heads of States and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), directed the President of ECOWAS Commission to begin the process of amending the 2001 Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance in order to ensure democracy, peace and stability, as well as halt the incessant coup in the sub-region.\n\nThe instruction was given in light of recent perennial coup in the region.\n\nThis is contained in a resolution reached at the Extraordinary Session of the Authority of Head of State and Government of ECOWAS held in Accra.\n\nThe Authority said that consolidation of democracy and good governance is crucial for the development, peace and stability of the ECOWAS region.\n\nThe meeting which was chaired by the President of the Republic of Ghana and Chair of\n\nthe Authority, Mr. Nana Akufo-Addo, also condemned in strong terms the decision of the transitional authorities to hire private security companies in Mali.\n\nIt further expressed great\n\nconcern about its consequences on the deterioration of the security situation in\n\nMali and the region as a whole.\n\nThe Heads of State and Government took note of the Report of the High-\n\nLevel Mission dispatched to the Republic of Guinea on 10 September 2021,\n\nfollowing the Extraordinary Session of the Authority held via videoconference on\n\n8 September 2021.\n\nThey also took note of the report on the political transition in the Republic of Mali, presented by the Mediator H.E Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\nThe Authority applauded the quality of the reports and the relevance of the\n\nrecommendations contained therein.\n\nThe Authority, after deliberations, endorsed the main recommendations\n\ncontained in the Mission\u2019s report.\n\nThe Authority reiterates its unreserved condemnation of the coup of 5\n\nSeptember 2021 and reaffirms its demand for the immediate and unconditional\n\nrelease of President Alpha Conde.\n\nIt also reminds members of the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development (CNRD) that they are individually\n\nand collectively responsible for the physical safety of President Alpha Conde.\n\nHowever, instead of waste this huge resources that ECOWAS is wasting under the guise of mediation and diplomatic mission to Mali or Guinea, prevention by way of discouraging siting President from tinkering with constitution to elongate their stay in office is less expensive.\n\nIssuing of threats and sanctions on military junta by the regional and sub regional bodies are mere rain that washes the stone.\n\nThe right thing to do is to always support the people to resist any attempt by any Presidents to change the constitution to allow him another term in office.\n\nTime shall come and that time is now when the ECOWAS authorities must wake up to its responsibility and nip this crisis in the bud once and for all.",

          "text": "As the world celebrates International Peace Day 2021 , stakeholders in the peacebuilding environment have called for workable strategies that would help resolve violent conflict in the country.\n\nInternational Day of Peace is observed across the world on September 21 every year.\n\nThe UN General Assembly declared this as a day devoted to making the ideals of peace robust.\n\nSpeaking at an outdoor event organized by the Institute of Peace and Conflict Resolution in collaboration with its partners to commemorate World Peace Day 2021, the Executive Director, CLEEN Foundation , Ms. Ruth Olofin tasked the government to design workable and realistic strategies that will help resolve the myriad conflicts confronting the country and return it on the path of peace.\n\nShe noted that local and homegrown tact and strategy are essential to resolving the crisis in Nigeria.\n\nWhile welcoming partners and stakeholders to the ceremony, the Director-General IPCR, Dr. Bakut Tswah Bakut said that the theme of this year\u2019s celebration is, \u201cRecovering better for an equitable and sustainable world.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cSo our duty as a peace institute is to continue to research on the various dynamics, and the causes and the triggers of conflict while developing consistent and dynamic policies as well as enable the government to deal with strategies that will bring about conflict mitigations. So what we have done is to directly intervene in all the political wards in the country. We are engaged in sensitization, advocacy, conflict resolution, mediation, as well as the capacity building across the seven hundred and seventy-four (774) local government areas in the country.\n\n\u201cPart of our function in IPCR is to mediate and manage various conflicts in Nigeria and Africa at large. Between the time that we were established and now, it appears that we have more conflict now than then, but that is because conflict is dynamic, when you deal with one aspect of the conflict, it metamorphoses into another form\u201d.\n\nHe added that, \u201cAt the moment we have ten zonal offices and five of those zonal offices are actually engaged in advocacy, sensitization as well as celebration of this international day of peace. One of the things we have done this year is to ensure that communities are encouraged to silence the gun and that is why we say take responsibility. It is not just the government that would take responsibility, you as an individual have to take responsibility in making sure that the guns are silenced\u201d.\n\nThe DG also explained that the international day of peace is the United Nations UN day declared all over the world, that this particular day is a day of the ceasefire, where ever there is conflict, where ever there is war.\n\nHe further said that on this particular day, all the guns of war and conflict must be silenced.\n\nOn the significance of the day, he said that it is a day people are encouraged to silence the gun.\n\nOn his part, the Chiefs of Civil-Military Affairs (Army) Major General MG Kangye said that the presence of troops of the Nigerian Army in troubled spots in the country gives confidence to locals to go about their legitimate business without fear.\n\nRepresented by the Acting Director of Information Management, Department of Civil-Military Affairs, Colonel Kayode Ogunsanya said that the Nigerian Army under the incumbent administration has employed a non-kinetic approach to restoring peace in crisis areas in the country.\n\nHe concluded that the High Command of the Nigerian Army is prioritizing the welfare of troops.",

          "text": "France will send its ambassador back to Washington next week after French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden agreed in a phone call Wednesday to meet next month over a submarine spat that sent relations between the longtime allies into a tailspin.\n\nThe two heads of state \u201chave decided to open a process of in-depth consultations, aimed at creating the conditions for ensuring confidence,\u201d the Elysee and the White House said in a joint statement. Macron and Biden will meet at the end of October in Europe, the statement said.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, France recalled its ambassador after the U.S., Australia and Britain announced a new Indo-Pacific defense deal last week. As part of the pact, Australia will cancel a multibillion-dollar contract to buy diesel-electric French submarines and acquire U.S. nuclear-powered vessels instead.\n\nThe French ambassador will \u201chave intensive work with senior U.S. officials\u201d after his return to the United States, the statement said.\n\nBiden and Macron agreed \u201cthat the situation would have benefitted from open consultations among allies on matters of strategic interest to France and our European partners,\u201d it said. Biden \u201cconveyed his ongoing commitment in that regard.\u201d\n\nBiden reaffirmed in the statement \u201cthe strategic importance of French and European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d\n\nThe European Union unveiled last week a new strategy for boosting economic, political and defense ties in the vast area stretching from India and China through Japan to Southeast Asia and eastward past New Zealand to the Pacific.\n\nThe United States also \u201crecognizes the importance of a stronger and more capable European defense, that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to NATO,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNo decision has been made about the French ambassador to Australia, who was also recalled last week, the Elysee said, adding that no phone call with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was scheduled.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Macron\u2019s office said the French president was expecting \u201cclarifications and clear commitments\u201d from Biden, who had requested the call.\n\nFrench officials described as a \u201ccrisis of trust\u201d last week\u2019s announcement of the Indo-Pacific deal, with Macron being formally informed only a few hours beforehand. The move had prompted fury in Paris, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian calling it a \u201cstab in the back.\u201d\n\nParis is now calling for \u201cacts, not words only,\u201d Macron\u2019s office said.\n\nFrance\u2019s European Union partners agreed Tuesday to put the dispute at the top of the bloc\u2019s political agenda, including at an EU summit next month.\n\nFollowing the Macron-Biden call, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met in New York with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as the administration worked to repair the damage done to broader EU-U.S. relations by the deal.\n\nBlinken spoke of the need for trans-Atlantic cooperation on any number issues \u201cquite literally around the world, to include of course Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific and Europe and beyond.\u201d\n\nBorrell, taking note of the phone call, said he hoped to be able to \u201cbuild a stronger confidence among us following the conversation that had been taking place this morning between President Biden and President Macron. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be working together.\u201d\n\nThe French presidency categorically denied a report by Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph newspaper published on Wednesday saying Macron could offer the country\u2019s permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council to the European Union if the bloc backs his plans on EU defense.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson dismissed French anger over the submarine deal, saying French officials should \u201cget a grip.\u201d Using both French and English words, he added they should give him a \u201cbreak.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters on a visit to Washington, Johnson said the deal was \u201cfundamentally a great step forward for global security. It\u2019s three very like-minded allies standing shoulder-to-shoulder, creating a new partnership for the sharing of technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exclusive. It\u2019s not trying to shoulder anybody out. It\u2019s not adversarial towards China, for instance.\u201d\n\nThe deal has widely been seen as part of American efforts to counter a more assertive China in the Indo-Pacific region.",

          "text": "Britain\u2019s Anthony Joshua could face his toughest test yet when he fights Oleksandr Usyk in London on Saturday, says ex-world champion George Groves.\n\nJoshua, 31, puts his WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO world heavyweight titles on the line against Usyk, a former undisputed cruiserweight world champion.\n\nThe 34-year-old Ukrainian has won all 18 professional fights, beating Tony Bellew and Derek Chisora on that run.\n\n\u201cTechnically, Usyk is brilliant,\u201d said Groves on the 5 Live Boxing podcast.\n\n\u201cHe showed that in unifying the cruiserweight division in great fights and I believe he could be Joshua\u2019s toughest test to date. This is the first fight when I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Joshua got beaten.\n\n\u201cJoshua has fought [Wladimir] Klitschko and been in with Joseph Parker and also been beaten [by Andy Ruiz] and the only question mark for Usyk is: Is he big enough to compete with AJ?\n\n\u201cIf Usyk keeps a high pace and makes Joshua miss with a lot of shots, that will work to Usyk\u2019s advantage as he has probably got a better engine.\n\n\u201cJoshua is a phenomenal athlete with tremendous punching power and strength but has a tendency to tire out if the pace is uncomfortable for him.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s fight from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live with full commentary from 22:00 BST.\n\nA crowd of more than 60,000 is expected and it will be the largest attendance Joshua has fought in front of since his win over Alexander Povetkin with 80,000 at Wembley Stadium in September 2018.\n\nSince then, Joshua has lost to Ruiz in New York before winning the rematch in Saudi Arabia and gained a ninth-round victory over Bulgaria\u2019s Kubrat Pulev at Wembley Arena last December, with only 1,000 fans attending because of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nBoth Joshua and Usyk won gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics, at super-heavyweight and heavyweight respectively, with the Briton going on to win 24 of his 25 professional fights, including 22 inside the distance.\n\nDillian Whyte, who lost to Joshua in 2015 and is pushing for a rematch with him or a shot at WBC champion Tyson Fury, believes the key to beating Usyk on Saturday is to adopt an attacking strategy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great fight and Joshua will stop him in the first six or seven rounds,\u201d Whyte told the 5 Live Boxing podcast.\n\n\u201cUsyk will start fast and Joshua should be cagey as Usyk is a bit lighter. Joshua can sometimes lack confidence but hopefully he goes back to the old him, starts pressing, being the bigger, stronger guy and gets the job done early.\n\n\u201cIf Joshua sets the pace, he can get an early knockout and if he is strong, confident and walks him down, then I don\u2019t see Usyk\u2019s punches troubling Joshua.\u201d\n\nGroves, who held the WBA super-middleweight belt in 2017 and 2018, added: \u201cIf I was Joshua, I would take control of the ring and try to dominate and bully off the front foot.\n\n\u201cUsyk will want to be off the back foot for the first couple of rounds, then try to pepper Joshua.\n\n\u201cIf I was in the Joshua camp, I would say: You want to keep this guy in his box. You don\u2019t want Usyk having any confidence, so hit him hard and early.\n\n\u201cIn the first three rounds, you want to land something big on him.\u201d\n\nPromoter Eddie Hearn also suggested Joshua could get an early victory.\n\nHearn said: \u201cI\u2019m always nervous for an Anthony Joshua fight, especially when you\u2019re fighting someone that really believes he is going to win.\n\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019re in the game for. If we win, the celebrations will be wild; if we lose, we will be gutted.\n\n\u201cAJ is comfortable with what he is doing, which is important in a fight like this, and he appreciates how tough this is.\n\n\u201cI think AJ wins by stoppage and that could happen early. AJ has to put dents in him early on.\u201d",
