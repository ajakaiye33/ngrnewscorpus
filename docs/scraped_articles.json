          "text": "By Evelyn Usman & Wole Mosadomi\n\nAn attempt to abduct a four-year-old child from a school in Omole Estate, Phase 1, Lagos, was foiled, yesterday, this is coming on the heels of the abduction of a Catholic Priest, Reverend Leo Raphael Ozigi, and three other priests, on Sunday, in Minna, Niger State, after mass.\n\nA 43-year-old suspected member of a kidnap syndicate that specialised in abducting children from Lagos and taking them to Ibadan, Oyo State, for ritual purposes, Kayode Olafisoye, and his fleeing partner, Kayode Akinola, stormed Mind Builders Private School, in the Omole Estate, at about 8am, yesterday, waiting for a convenient time to strike.\n\n\u201cVanguard gathered that a parent brought her four-year-old kindergarten to school in a car, at about 8.30am.\n\nImmediately the door of the car was opened to allow the child out, the kidnappers reportedly went for him.An alarm, which alerted the neighbourhood, was raised, consequent upon which Olafisoye was arrested, while his partner managed to escape.\n\nA liquid substance, which he said was administered on their victims to put them to sleep, was recovered from him.\n\nShortly before he was handed over to the Police at Ojudu Division, the suspect revealed that he had been in the business of kidnapping pupils in different parts of Lagos for a long time.\n\nSpeaking in Yoruba language, Olafisoye said: \u201c We came from Ibadan. I can\u2019t tell how many children we have kidnapped in Lagos.\n\nSome of the areas in Lagos where we have kidnapped children are Berger, Ikotun, Iyana-Oba, Iyana-Ipaja. I can not remember other areas. \u201cThis is the first time we are coming to Omole Estate.\u201cWhenever we kidnap these children, we would give them a tablet that would daze them.\n\nWe also give them this liquid substance (pointing to the black substance inside the bottle found on him). It is gutter water. It puts them to sleep. We don\u2019t have any particular child in mind.\n\n\u201cImmediately we find a soft target, we would put them inside our car and zoom off. Our targets are usually children between four and seven years, who are not able to shout for help.\n\nThese children are used for rituals in Ibadan\u201d.The Spokesman for the Lagos State Police Command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed the arrest, said the Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi has directed that the suspect be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, SCID, Yaba for further investigation, adding that efforts were on to arrest the fleeing member.\n\nIn a related development, a Catholic Priest, Reverend Leo Raphael Ozigi, and three other Priests of the same Church were also kidnapped between Sarkin Pawa and Minna on Sunday as they were returning to Minna, Niger State capital after the Sunday Mass.\n\nThe suspected bandits reportedly raided some Communities in Munya local government area of the State killing scores of the villagers and also abducting an unspecified number of people.It was gathered that the bandits had stormed some of the Villages in Munya local government area Sunday afternoon and started moving from house to house raiding members of the Communities of their belongings including money and foodstuffs.\n\nThe bandits, who reportedly rode on Motorcycles with sophisticated weapons, raided villages like Tsihon Kabula, Jesso, Gunu, Gini, Chibani and Injita among others, where an unspecified number of people were killed.\n\nSimilarly, the bandits were said to have set up a camp at Chibani after blocking a bridge linking Munya local government and Shiroro to forestall any raid on them by the Joint Task Force.\n\n\u201cIt was also reliably gathered that no fewer than fifteen communities were raided within forty-eight hours unhindered in the state.In Zagzaga Community, an octogenarian was reportedly set ablaze out of anger by the bandits when they discovered that the villagers had deserted the community.\n\nThe old man, it was gathered, was unable to escape due to his old age and chose to remain in his room but was set ablaze by the bandits.\n\nCommissioner for Local Government and Internal Security, Mr Emmanuel Umar, who confirmed the development, said \u201cThere were some invasions by bandits on some communities in Munya local government area but we are still monitoring the situation.\n\n\u201cI cannot say the exact number of people killed or abducted but we will issue a statement later,\u201d he remarked.Secretary of Munya Local Government Council, Mr James Jagaba, also confirmed the incident to Journalists on phone.According to him,\u201d the terrorists have been operating unhindered for several hours and presently, they are still there.\n\n\u201cNobody can tell you the number of people already killed or kidnapped, all I know is that there are casualties,\u201d Secretary to the Local government declared.\n\nThe State Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Niger State Chapter,(CAN) Reverend Mathias Echioda when contacted simply said, \u201cI can only confirm to you of the Catholic Reverend kidnapped. I cannot specifically say how many other Priests were kidnapped along with him.",

          "text": "\u2026As association picks Reps nomination forms for Ajia\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nFormal national publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Olisa Metuh has advised the party\u2019s zoning committee not to shut the door against any aspirant in the name of zoning.\n\nAccording to Metuh, PDP will be going into the 2023 general election as an opposition party and as such must tread carefully before taking a position on the sensitive issue.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the 37-man committee chaired by Benue state governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, Metuh said opening the race to qualified party members regardless of geo-political zone, would deepen conversation across board, preparatory to the Presidential primaries.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cHistory beckons on each and every one of you to take a decision that will not only stabilize our party but also showcase the readiness of our party for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe choice before you today is between adhering to the principles of equity, fairness and natural justice or plainly focusing on the task of winning an election as an opposition party. Indeed, they are inseparable and none can be discarded for the other.\n\n\u201cThere have been arguments about the fairness of zoning to the south after eight years of the Buhari Presidency. There are also counter-arguments of the North having ruled for only two years and nine months out of 16 years of PDP in power and therefore deserves its own fair share of presidential candidacy after only two attempts(2007 and 2019) as opposed to the four by the south(1999, 2003, 2011 and 2015).\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the merits of either side of the divide, most Nigerians hold only one truth as self evident at this time of our political development: that in good conscience and for equity and fairness, it is really the turn of the South-East to produce the next President of Nigeria.\n\nREAD ALSO: Olisa Metuh writes PDP committee on zoning\n\n\u201cThe South-East zone on its own has thrown up very quality candidates and in reality, no Nigerian can question the proven tract record of prudence and accountability of Mr Peter Obi in managing an economy or the leadership qualities in service delivery of Senator Pius Anyim. It is therefore clear that the South-East of PDP deserves and is actually ready to deliver our country out of the present doldrums.\n\n\u201cHowever, oftentimes, what is desirable may not be achievable and therefore there is need for the PDP to thread carefully and be sensitive on how to tackle the North where the All Progressives Congress, APC, controls 14 states as opposed to only four states by us. In 2015, we adopted sole candidacy and dampened the morale of members to openly campaign for the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe real argument therefore is that our party is built on the ideals of our founding fathers and that the principles of equity, fairness and natural justice appear non-negotiable at every stage of our development.\n\n\u201cEven the argument that the preamble provides for zoning of offices cannot ignore the same preamble that stated, \u2018prompted by a firm conviction that the enthronement of a moral social order will result in the spiritual regeneration of the nation.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt may therefore appear inequitable, unfair and repugnant to natural justice for a decent and noble party like the PDP, having allowed individuals to campaign for such a long period with the attendant human and material cost, to undemocratically truncate their aspiration with zoning at this late hour.\n\n\u201cAre we still enthroning a moral social order that will result in the spiritual regeneration of the nation or are we engaging in an act capable of breeding discontent, disharmony and disaffection by those unfairly disadvantaged by taking a good policy at a very late hour?\n\n\u201cFor the records, the 2019 zoning to the North was done well ahead of the primaries and no member from the South complained of having suffered untold hardship on that account.\u201d\n\nGoing down memory lane, Metuh urged the PDP to remember \u201cthe sad events of 2013 and 2014 where some of our founding members were encouraged to leave by outright denial of equal opportunities and other similar actions done with impunity of power. I remember the cases of Governor Ortom, Chief Banabas Gemade, Governor Tambuwal, ex-governors Wamako, Nyako and many orders.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cNothing should be done to appear to take us back to such a period of arrogance of power especially as we are in opposition.\n\n\u201cWe are faced with a ruling party that appear to be re-organising. They have taken good political hands from us and promoted them to the highest positions not minding any emotional blackmail.\n\n\u201cJust this morning, the Presidency is already mocking us with complaints of our absorbing our former members. I believe the APC is actually frightened of the potency of our former leaders who have fully returned to our party. We should not play into the hands of conspiratorial tactics of our competition, the APC.\n\n\u201cAs a person who participated fully in organizing our resistance at the height of the popularity of APC; one who suffered greatly at great human and material costs, including denial of my liberty and freedom, as the longest serving elected member of the National Executive Committee of the PDP in history and one who has served as ex-officio member of the NEC, zonal youth leader, national auditor, national vice chairman and national publicity secretary, I plead that none of you should fall into the temptation of attempting to zone offices at this late hour.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Agaka Isale community Development Association, yesterday, obtained the expression of interest and nomination forms for Ibrahim Ajia to represent them as a member of the House of Representatives for Asa/llorin West Federal Constituency.\n\nPresident of the association, Yusuf Aloba said: \u201cWe have endorsed him and we have contributed to pick up the nomination forms for him because of his sacrifices for the community and the people. He has all the qualities needed to provide quality representation for us at the green chamber. He is well educated, exposed and connected enough to attract huge dividends of democracy to our constituency.\u201d",

If the route that we all deem to be safer is suddenly overrun by terrorists, then security agencies should have no sleep because those non-state actors have become even more daring and will carry out even more audacious attacks.\u201d\n\n@TheEnike \u201cEl Rufai had a lot to say about Boko Haram and insecurity when Jonathan was president. Now that you\u2019re governor and your party is in charge, you\u2019re almost helpless and can\u2019t call out PMB\u2019s failure on security.\u201d\n\n@Shemang_David \u201cIt\u2019s either Kaduna State Government is responsible for the sad incident/attacks on residents or it\u2019s grossly irresponsible and incompetent. Either way, El Rufai has blood on his hands.\u201d\n\n@Unekue \u201cAirport not safe, Rail not safe, Roads not safe, El Rufai has succeeded in isolating Kaduna as genocide in southern Kaduna continues.\u201d\n\n@Pascal \u201cWhat is humanity without Empathy? Dr Chinelo, it\u2019s sad you died this way. Nigeria is toxic, El Rufai, under your watch!\n\n\u201cI have been shot please pray for me.\u201d was her last tweet 10hours ago and many of you used her to chase clout.\u201d\n\n@Izzyfather \u201cPresident Buhari, Gov el-Rufai and Gen Dambazau owe Nigerians an explanation on how our country came under the control of bandits! Yet, these men are tightly protected while the innocent Nigerians are paying for the sins they never committed.\u201d\n\n@ItsTheLazyChef \u201cBusinesses have crumbled, thousands of lives have been lost yet El Rufai still doesn\u2019t know what to do. Kudos for building the nice roads in Kaduna but why is there so much insecurity in your state El-rufai.\u201d\n\n@SamzyPR \u201cSome days ago, Kaduna Airport was overrun by terrorists on motorcycles under Buhari and El-Rufai. What a colossal failure. Yesterday, The Abuja-Train Attack took the lives and Properties of People away!\u201d\n\n@ChosenSomto \u201cEl Rufai, your party APC has marked us all for assassination, Chinelo was killed yesterday, who dies next?\u201d\n\n@OfficialKingMoc \u201cEl Rufai knew everything about security until it\u2019s time to solve it.\u201d\n\n@KingofAproko \u201cChinelo is not the only victim of this terrorist attack in Kaduna does the life of others mean nothing. Nigeria is really a shit hole .and if we continue to ignore the like of El-Rufai we can\u2019t move forward. Nigeria must have a voice.\u201d\n\n@I_amchukaa \u201cEl Rufai is playing games with people\u2019s lives. The highest terrorism in Nigeria is in your state yet you collect so much amount of security allowance. Next year, you would increase it and still do NOTHING. El Rufai is a failed leader.\u201d\n\n@Alaye_100 \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before bandits make a play for the city of Kaduna and if they do, I trust El Rufai to get them to attack Government House and be \u2018repelled\u2019 with no harm coming to him and his. The one weakness he has in all of this is that he worries about his political career.\u201d",

          "text": "As the Super Eagles clash with Black Stars of Ghana in the second leg of the play off for Qatar 2022 ticket, here are seven things to expect:\n\n1: The presence of 60,000 spectators at the Moshood Abiola Stadium with vociferous support holds the key to Nigeria\u2019s triumph over their West African arch rivals. The joint efforts of NFF and Ministry of Youth and Sports Development to fill the stadium by offering free tickets and buses to fans may be the joker for the Super Eagles to seal their spot at Qatar\n\n2: With the likely absence of Samuel Chukwueze and Innocent Bonke due to injuries from last Friday\u2019s goalless draw in Kumasi, this may give chance to Frank Onyeka to man the midfield. Onyeka impressed even as a second half substitute in Kumasi and it would be nice to see him replicate those eye-catching moves in Abuja today.\n\n3: Though President Muhammad Buhari has been touted to grace the match to inspire the Eagles, he may be represented by Vice President Yemi Osibajo whose office oversees sports. Of course, there would be retinue of other government officials expected at this important game.\n\n4: As Eagles search for goals today, the possible partnership of Victor Osimhen and Odion Ighalo may surface to lead the attacking lineup of Eagles. Will the Super Eagles coaching crew be tempted to unleash both strikers against Ghana following their goal scoring feats at their respective clubs.\n\n5: Will Eagles open the newly renovated Moshood Abiola Stadium with an important win against Ghanaians today as two ex-internationals Austin Eguavoen and Atto Addo of Ghana go up against each other in the battle of former superstars?\n\n6: Nigeria needs an outright win to edge Ghana as any score draw will spell doom for the coach Austin Eguavoen- led Super Eagles.\n\n7: They say figure seven is magical hence Nigeria stands a good chance to qualify for her seventh FIFA World Cup finals. The Super Eagles have qualified for every edition of the World Cup bar Germany 2006 since their debut at USA 1994 Finals. The Super Eagles were also at France \u201998, Korea/ Japan 2002; South Africa 2010; Brazil 2014 and Russia 2018.",

Let me tell you this if we find out in five years\u2019 time that this church starts to have a crisis. And things start to go down and you find out that the Lord spoke to me and I did not obey him.\n\n\u201cAnd it becomes like the case of Jonah or Achan, I hope you will not say thank God you did not answer God. You will be angry that God spoke to me and I did not obey. All I am doing is obeying God. This is action is not any action of avarice. It is not any action of greediness. It is nothing but obeying God. And this is what I have preached for 30 years.\n\nRead Also: How RCCG pastor emerged Soun of Ogbomoso\n\n\u201cI told God if it is not your will, Lord stop it, let it not go through. But then I got into the process. I am only following God.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in this world that anybody has to offer me than what I have committed half of my life to do. If you know me very well, I am not doing this because I have nothing else to do. I am doing it because I believe it with my whole heart.\u201d\n\nOn fears that he may have to compromise his Christian faith through involvement in traditional rituals as demanded by custom, Olaoye said: \u201dI can tell you, I have only one covenant. The blood of Jesus is enough for me. No other covenant will I engage in. I am not going to go into the details of a lot of things you have seen on social media.\u201d\n\nHe denied he had resigned as senior pastor of the church as widely reported in the media, stating he couldn\u2019t have become the process of becoming the Soun was not yet completed.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is still a process. We will tell you when the process is over.\u201d\n\nConfirming The Nation\u2019s exclusive report of how he emerged, Olaoye said: \u201cThere were 23 of us before I entered into the race. Two of us were eventually picked. The chairman of the kingmaker voted for me to break the tie. The next thing is that it goes to the governor.\n\n\u201cIf you know the process, the person who makes anybody a king is the governor. The kingmaker can choose you. Your family can choose you, which they did not initially. But that is a story for another day. It is the governor who chooses.\u201d",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nIn its reaction to the weekend national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in Abuja, at the weekend, where a new National Working Committee of the party was elected, a day after, the PDP, in a statement by the its spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, the party said it was \u201cappalling to see APC leaders come out one after the other at their national jamboree to spew out lies and false performance claims on the economy, infrastructure and security even in the face of biting economic hardship, high cost of living, excruciating fuel emergency, lingering crisis in the education sector and escalated insecurity that was happening real time and simultaneously when the ridiculous claims of achievements were being made.\u201d\n\nBut, the Federal Government accused the PDP of advocating the destruction of Nigeria by threatening to unleash another round of EndSARS on the country and deliberately misinforming Nigerians on the APC government.\n\n\u201c\u2026As you know, the folks on the other side have been doing everything in recent times to overheat the polity, distort the achievements of our Administration and spread misinformation. Yes, it is very cold out there for the hungry and desperate opposition, but every indication is that they don\u2019t even want to wait for the 2023 elections before testing their popularity or acceptability at the polls.\n\n\u201cHow else does one explain their court case seeking the declaration of our convention as illegal? How do you explain their threat of another EndSARS that pushed Nigerian to the brink? How do you explain their glaring misinformation regarding the nation\u2019s state of affairs?\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in having a fiery and viable opposition in a democracy. We were there before and we remain the ones to beat in terms of a determined, viable and relentless opposition. But, in our time, not once did we advocate the destruction of Nigeria just because we couldn\u2019t have our way. Not once did we seek to gain power via a desperate court action.

Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cIn their most recent act of desperation, they sought to erase seven years of unprecedented achievements by the Buhari Administration. In the most egregious show of shamelessness and a blatant refusal to be remorseful, they even had the audacity to express righteous indignation that the damage they inflicted on the country in their 16 years of misrule has not been totally undone in just seven years. In other words, those who brought the country to its knees are now accusing those working hard to repair things of non-performance. They said they are ready to rescue Nigeria. Pray, where do kidnappers rescue their victims? These same guys who kidnapped the fortunes of their country are suddenly posing as rescuers. Caveat Emptor; buyers beware! Nigerians beware!\u201d government said.\n\nThe minister dismissed the opposition party\u2019s claim that the PDP government handed over $550 billion economy, with single digit inflation and a much reduced debt profile.\n\n\u201cAsk them what infrastructure did they leave behind? Ask them how many motorable roads did they leave behind? They frittered away our gains from oil sales. How many times, on paper, did they launch the second Niger Bridge? How many times did they launch reconstruction of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway on paper?\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that opposition should not critique. What we are saying is that they should not promote anarchy because we didn\u2019t do that in our time. They wrecked the the economy and we are rebuilding it. They wrecked the country\u2019s infrastructure and we are rebuilding them?\u2026When PDP left, 21 states could not pay the salary of their staff. They should stop re-writing history while we are alive..\u201d\n\nAsked if he was satisfied that the APC government has ameliorated the sufferings of Nigerians, in light of the present economic situation in the country, Mohammed replied: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of this administration\u2019s efforts to ameliorate the suffering of Nigerians. Before we came, there was nothing like the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP).\n\n\u201cThey gloat that Nigerians are suffering under our watch. But we say that while they laid the ground work for today\u2019s suffering with their mismanagement of national resources at a time of plenty, we have introduced unprecedented measures to alleviate the suffering of Nigerians, especially the very vulnerable. Our NSIP is the biggest of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa. The N-Power benefits one million people; the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP), has benefitted four million people; the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) is providing quality meals daily to 10 million primary school pupils, in addition to empowering over 100,000 cooks and the same number of small holder farmers in the local areas where the schools are located; the Household Uplifting Programme (HUP), which has the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) as its flagship intervention, provides N5,000 monthly grants to almost 2 million eligible households across the country, in addition addition to the 1 million Urban Poor who are benefitting from the Conditional Cash Transfers, under the directive of Mr. President to further expand the programme due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.\u201d\n\nOn the double digit inflation raving the economy, the minister noted that, \u201c inflation is a global issue. On petrol scarcity: if only they did the needful (in overhauling infrastructure), we would have been benefitting from increase in crude oil prices today.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Scores of families seek information on loved ones, as El-Rufai visits scene accompanied by troops\n\n\u2022Many feared kidnapped, scores shot\n\n\u2022 NRC MD confirm attack, recounts how he spoke to train driver\n\nKingsley Nwezeh, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\n\n\nForty-eight hours after attacking the Kaduna airport, killing an aviation worker and injuring many others, terrorists, yesterday, escalated their attacks by bombing an Abuja-Kaduna train, with some 970 passengers onboard.\n\nIt was, however, not the first time that the extremists had targeted the train in furtherance of their attacks.\n\nAlready, scores of families had begun to seek information on their loved ones, who were believed to be onboard the train, trying to mark them safe.\n\nAlthough reports on casualties were still sketchy, unconfirmed details claimed many of the passengers were kidnapped, while scores were shot by the terrorists while forcing their way into the train.\n\nManaging Director of Nigerian Railways Corporation (NRC), Fidet Okhiria, who confirmed the development, recounted how he spoke to the train driver, saying, \u201cWe cannot give you much information now,\u201d as no one was able to give an accurate account of what happened as at press time.\n\nAt the same time, the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, had immediately visited the scene of the attack last night, accompanied by some troops to have a firsthand information on the situation.\n\nThis is as the state government, which had earlier confirmed the incident, stating that, the government had since secured the train through mobilisation and reinforcement of the security.\n\nThere have been various accounts about how the terrorists might have succeeded in derailing the train, which reportedly left station in Abuja around 6pm yesterday.\n\nSome accounts alleged that improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were planted in one of the coaches, which exploded, derailing and destroying some of the coaches and leaving the fate of the 970 passengers onboard or the casualty figures uncertain.\n\nAnother account claimed the attack was carried out using a detonated device suspected to be a bomb planted on the rail track, which exploded on impact as train rode on the spot.\n\nBut THISDAY could not independently confirm if the bomb was planted on the train or rail track.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that as part of moves to secure the trains, Minister of Transportation Chibuike Amaechi, had long made efforts to bring in some special security detection devices, that would aid the operators of the trains to detect IEDs and other like components for passengers\u2019 safety, but the move had been stalled for some time now as a result of bureaucratic bottlenecks in the system.\n\nSources said many of the passengers were abducted while others were trapped on the floor of the train at the time of filling this report.\n\nIn the addition to the myriad of information coming in pieces, THISDAY learnt the attack occurred at a point between Katari and Rijana.\n\nAn eye-witness account said the impact of the explosion was what derailed the train.\n\n\u201cThey planted IED. When it went off, it derailed the train. There was pandemonium everywhere and some people may be kidnapped,\u201d the source said.\n\nOne of the passengers, who reportedly confirmed the incident in a telephone call, said the attackers had surrounded the train and shot sporadically.\n\nAnother panic-stricken passenger explained, \u201cAll the passengers are currently lying on the floor of the train. The bandits are shooting sporadically. We are in serious danger.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with a national daily (not THISDAY), a passenger said he counted six people with bullet wounds but could not say if they were dead.\n\n\u201cThere are six people we have counted with bullet wounds, there maybe more but so far this is what I can confirm. Security agents are trying to get them medical attention. We also learnt that the bandits forced their way into some coaches and have abducted some people,\u201d he said.\n\nZainab Musa, another passenger, according to the national daily, which could not independently verify some of the claims, described the attack as shocking. She explained, \u201cCurrently we are all lying down flat and security forces have started converging to drive the terrorists away. We are grateful to be safe and not harmed.\u201d\n\nPassenger Anas Iron Danmusa said the explosives planted by the terrorists \u201cdestroyed\u201d the engine of the train.\n\nPlease this is an emergency. We are inside train at the moment. Kidnappers planted explosives and the train engines have been ruined. We are helpless. Abuja to Kaduna train. Gunshots still being fired right around us. We are just under the seats praying to God while waiting for help.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201csince 8pm, we have been here. The gunmen were shooting sporadically around Katari-Rijana area. I am a living witness.\u201d\n\nThere were at least 970 passengers onboard the train, according to official sources familiar with the train service.\n\nOkhiria, who was already in Abuja, said, \u201cMost of the passengers have gone into hiding and they cannot be giving information, but there are reports of gunshots, continued gunshot as the train stopped,\u201d confirming too, that the attack occurred at a point between Katari and Rijana.\n\nThe managing director added that some passengers could not leave the train, which meant nobody knew what might happen to them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government said last night that relevant agencies were urgently contacted, and robust deployments of personnel were swiftly made to the area to secure the passengers on board.\n\nThe government said, \u201cThe Kaduna State Government received multiple reports of an attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train service at around Kateri-Rijana general areas. Efforts are on-going to convey the passengers from the location and others that sustained injuries have been rushed to hospitals for medical attention.\n\nThe Kaduna State government said, \u201cThe government of Kaduna State will be liaising with the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to ascertain the list from the passengers\u2019 manifest for efficient tracking. This is to acquire an accurate inventory of all passengers and their actual status.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufa\u2019I, who has been in constant touch with the security forces, commended them for their prompt response, and thanked them for successfully securing the train and passengers on board.\u201d\n\nThe statement issued by the Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State, Mr Samuel Aruwan, said security forces had continued to comb the general area in additional rescue efforts.\n\n\u201cEmerging developments will be communicated to the public,\u201d the state government stated, adding, \u201cSecurity agencies have reported to the Kaduna State government that the military has secured the Kaduna bound train from Abuja trapped by terrorists.\u201d\n\nAccording to government sources, the continuous attacks informed the reason Amaechi bought into the idea of further securing the trains, when he approved the purchase of some security detection devices, unfortunately, the bottlenecks in the system stalled the move.\n\nAlthough the minister, according to sources, has continued to reiterate the need for the devices to come in as soon as possible in the interest of the public, some vested interest hiding behind due process had continued to delay the project.\n\n12 of Kaduna Airport Attackers Killed, Says Army\n\nIn a related development, the 1 Division of the Nigerian Army, Kaduna, yesterday, said, \u201cAbout 12\u201d of the terrorists that attacked the Kaduna International Airport on Saturday were killed through air strike.\n\nBriefing journalists after conducting them round the scene of the incident, the Garrison Commander of the Division, Brig-Gen. Uriah Opuene, said, preliminary investigations revealed that the bandits were just passing through the back of the Airport.\n\nOpuene said the terrorists were heading towards Riyawa village, when they sighted (and killed) the security man engaged by the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) to watch over their metrological equipment around the axis.\n\nOpuene stated, \u201cAs you can see, this place is about six kilometres away from the airport terminal. The bandits were only passing behind the airport perimeter fence, when they saw the security man engaged by NAMA and they fired at him. They just took advantage of that to pass a message that they have attacked the airport.\n\n\u201cThere are several layers of security at the airport, this is the first layer and even this first layer was not breached, because from the moment of hearing that shot, it took our men just about three minutes to get here from the next layer of security.\n\n\u201cOn arrival, the bandits were already running away, so we engaged them through the use of ground forces. Then, we called for air strike and an helicopter was deployed and from the air report, about 12 of the bandits were killed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Garrison Commander, who was in company with the Kaduna Air Force Base Commander, Air Commodore Ademuyiwa Adedoyin and the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, dismissed reports that the bandits took over the airport.\n\nAruwan said, \u201cSo, as you can see from the distance, the insinuation that the terrorists took over the airport is not correct. If the terrorists had entered, they would have met us there,\u201d the Garrison Commander said\n\nHe maintained that there were several layers of security at the Airport, stressing that bandits could not have dared to attack it.\n\nSpeaking also, NAF Base Commander, Air Commodore Adedoyin, said security around the airport area generally had been beefed up since the security breach at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) last year, adding that bandits didn\u2019t have the audacity to attack Kaduna Airport.\n\nAruwan said the state government was engaging communities around the airport to scale up intelligence gathering, and that there was no threat to the immediate vicinity of the airport, because the military was ahead of the terrorists.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says inflation a global trend\n\n\u2022Opposition party replies minister, says media briefing arrogant stunt to mislead Nigerians\n\nChuks Okocha and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government has lambasted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for being the architect of the country\u2019s economic hardship. The government alleged that the mismanagement of national resources by the opposition party at a time the economy was buoyant laid the foundation for the current woes.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the accusation yesterday at a no-holds-barred press briefing in Abuja.\n\nBut in a swift reaction yesterday, PDP dismissed the press conference addressed by the minister as another anthology of lies and bogus performance claims \u201cby the failed and rudderless All Progressives Congress (APC) administration.\u201d\n\nMohammed accused the opposition of gloating that Nigerians were suffering under the present administration and indulging in misrepresentation in their desperation to return to power to complete their demolition work on the country.\n\n\u201cBut we say that while they laid the groundwork for today\u2019s suffering with their mismanagement of national resources at a time of plenty, we have introduced unprecedented measures to alleviate the suffering of Nigerians, especially the very vulnerable,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe added, \u201cOur National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) is the biggest of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa. The N-Power benefits one million people; the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) has benefitted four million people; the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) is providing quality meals daily to 10 million primary school pupils, in addition to empowering over 100,000 cooks and the same number of small holder farmers in the local areas where the schools are located; the Household Uplifting Programme (HUP), which has the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) as its flagship intervention, provides N5,000 monthly grants to almost two million eligible households across the country, in addition benefitting from the Conditional Cash Transfers, under the directive of Mr. President to further expand the programme due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d\n\nMohammed criticised PDP, which was in power from 1999 to 2015, for depriving the country of the full benefits of oil windfall at a time of rising oil prices. He said the opposition party neglected the oil industry and for many years, failed to stimulate growth in the oil industry by refusing to put in place the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), until President Muhammadu Buhari signed it into law last year. He said the law was envisaged as a tool to foster investment in the industry and delineate responsibilities to the various institutions.\n\nThe minister flayed the opposition party for going overboard and doing everything in recent times to overheat the polity and distort the achievements of the administration through misinformation about the country\u2019s state of affairs.\n\nHe described PDP as a \u201chungry and desperate opposition\u201d that did want to wait for the 2023 elections to test their popularity or acceptability at the polls.\n\nMohammed stated further, \u201cGentlemen, there is nothing wrong in having a fiery and viable opposition in a democracy. We were there before and we remain the ones to beat in terms of a determined, viable and relentless opposition.\n\n\u201cBut, in our time, not once did we advocate the destruction of Nigeria just because we couldn\u2019t have our way. Not once did we seek to gain power via a desperate court action. If you destroy the country you are seeking to govern, what country will you govern? Must you cut your nose to spite your face?\u201d\n\nMohammed accused PDP of seeking to erase the seven years of unprecedented achievements by the Buhari administration in spite of bringing the country to its kneels in their 16 years of non-performance.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThey said they are ready to rescue Nigeria. Pray, where do kidnappers rescue their victims? These same guys who kidnapped the fortunes of their country are suddenly posing as rescuers. Caveat Emptor. Buyers Beware! Nigerians Beware!\n\n\u201cGentlemen, we are not unmindful of the challenges facing this administration, either in the area of economy, security, power, etc. But we have risen stoutly to the challenges, judiciously utilising the very scarce resources that we have, and we are making an impact. Nigerians are making great sacrifices because they know that today\u2019s difficulties are like the pangs heralding the birth of a new baby.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s pains won\u2019t endure, but the new Nigeria that will emerge will surely do. The people on the other side say infrastructure is not important. In their derisive posturing, they ask: \u2018na infrastructure we go chop?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut they have forgotten the role of infrastructure in economic development via higher productivity and service delivery, job creation and poverty alleviation, just to mention a few. Little wonder they frittered away the resources of the commonwealth instead of using such to develop our infrastructure during their time in the saddle.\u201d\n\nHe lauded the Buhari administration in the areas of security, repair and completion of long abandoned roads and bridges, rehabilitation of railway projects across the country, and delivery of four new state-of-the-art airport terminals in Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt. He added that the government was about to kick-start the construction of the second runway for the Abuja airport.\n\nHe said the only runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja, was left dilapidated until the present administration repaired it.\n\nMohammed noted that through the Police Trust Fund, 200 buffalo branded vehicles, bulletproof vests, protective helmets, drugs, and medical equipment as well as arms and ammunition, riot control equipment, and combat equipment were procured for the Police Special Weapon and Tactical Squad (SWAT).\n\nThe minister said Buhari had approved a 20 per cent review and upgrade of salaries for police personnel, in addition to enhanced duty tour allowance and tax waiver in the sum of N18.6 billion for junior officers to increase their take home pay.\n\nHe accused the opposition of mischief, being clever by half, and misusing statistics by comparing the prices of some foodstuffs, petrol, and diesel, among others, before 2015, with what currently prevailed.\n\n\u201cThis misuse of statistics is clear mischief,\u201d he insisted.\n\nAccording to him, a check on the prices of foodstuffs and petrol in other countries, especially the UK and the US, would show a steep rise, indicating the increase is a global trend and not limited to any country. He said it would be disingenuous to present the price increases as a Nigerian problem.\n\nOpposition Party Replies Minister, Says, Media Briefing Arrogant Stunt to Mislead Nigerians\n\nHowever, PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the press conference addressed by Mohammed was, \u201cAnother desperate and disoriented stunt by the APC administration to divert public attention from the exposed corruption records of the APC national leadership as well as the manifest collapse of security, command and control structure under President Buhari.\u201d\n\nPDP said, \u201cThe APC administration in its arrogance in failure attempted again to downplay and treat with levity, the excruciating economic hardship, hunger and other life discounting experiences being faced by Nigerians daily because of severe food crisis, lingering fuel emergency, high cost of essential commodities and services, closure of schools, insecurity and mass killing, collapse of healthcare system and decayed public infrastructure under its watch.\n\n\u201cIt is the height of impunity and arrogance that the Minister of Information and Culture could address the media to claim that the APC government has achieved food sufficiency, particularly in rice production, when in reality, there is famine in the land with the price of food items, especially rice soaring by over 400 per cent under the APC with its \u2018pyramid of lies\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to PDP, a bag of rice which sold for N7,500 under PDP now sells for over N30,000; a measure of beans, which sold for N350 under PDP now sells for over N1,000; a measure of garri, which sold for N120 under PDP now sells for N700, a bottle of palm oil, which sold for N250 under PDP now sells for over N1000.\n\nPDP pointed out that a kilo of meat, which sold for N700 under its administration, now sold for N3,000; a litre of petrol, which sold for N87 under PDP, was now as high as N400 to N500, while a litre of diesel, which sold for N110 under PDP, now cost over N800.\n\nThe main opposition party slammed Mohammed for provocatively claiming that Nigerians were better off under the APC.\n\nAccording to Ologunagba, Nigerians now know better, \u201cand the question to ask is, Is your life better now in 2022 under the APC than it was in 2015 under the PDP?\u201d\n\nHe said it was ludicrous and insensitive that \u201cthe APC government went to the media to list non-existent roads, bridges, agricultural and health projects as achievements.\n\n\u201cMore pathetic is the APC\u2019s attempt to claim credit for development projects initiated and implemented by successive PDP administrations, including our railways, aviation, agricultural, healthcare, education, telecommunications, banking and manufacturing sectors, among others.\u201d\n\nPDP said it was \u201claughable that the APC government is also claiming credit for critical projects in various parts of the country, which are being funded by resources mobilised by the PDP administrations under the framework of counterpart funding from international partners and bodies.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe only legitimate achievements of the APC government include its corruption record (second most corrupt in West Africa and 154 out of 180 in Global Corruption Index), over 33 per cent unemployment rate, a weakened currency at over N500 to a dollar, N33 trillion foreign debt and still counting, and the siphoning of over N16 trillion by APC leaders.\u201d\n\nPDP cautioned APC to note that \u201cits continued arrogance in failure is daily confronting and reminding Nigerians of the statement made by one of its founding members, the late Prince Tony Momoh in April 2016 and the consequences are better imagined.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says CBN disbursed N948bn to boost farming, 12.5million jobs created\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday, reiterated that he was currently focused on achieving a robust monetary policy and fighting inflation, which he stressed remained a global problem. Emefiele stated this via his verified Twitter handle, @GodwinIEmefiele, on the same day he revealed that the federal government had disbursed a total of N948 billion to 4,478,381 smallholder farmers to boost food production in Nigeria.\n\nIn the Tweet, Emefiele stated that he was committed to building a strong financial system in an increasingly uncertain global economy. He said he was also focused on boosting development finance and supporting farmers and manufacturers in the apex bank\u2019s self-sufficiency and import substitution drive.\n\nHe added that he remained committed to raising N15 trillion for the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo) to boost infrastructure financing in the country.\n\nThe CBN governor furthermore stated that he was committed to delivering a world-class International Financial Centre (IFC) in Lagos as well as providing the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari with the needed support to finish strong.\n\nEarlier in February, Emefiele, while reacting to speculations around his purported interest in the 2023 presidential race, had said it was the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to execute his succession plan in line with global best practice, for good governance and continuing peace and progress of the country.\n\nThe CBN governor stressed that he was focused on his job, even as he pledged to continue to support the federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, while presenting a convocation lecture titled, \u201cThe Role of Central Bank in Managing Economic Downturns,\u201d to mark the 40th anniversary of the university yesterday, Emefiele revealed that the federal government had disbursed a total of N948 billion to 4,478,381 smallholder farmers to boost food production in the country.\n\nHe added that apart from encouraging farming, the programme had generated an aggregate of 12.5 million direct and indirect jobs for the Nigerian youth.\n\nThe CBN governor said under the credit facility to help households and businesses that suffered significant losses during the pandemic, the central bank had disbursed N368.79 billion to 778,000 beneficiaries.\n\nGiving the breakdown of how the facility was disbursed, Emefiele revealed that 648,052 households and owners of small and medium scale Enterprises (SMEs) benefited from the federal government-driven policy.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAs you all know, one of the major challenges facing Nigerian economy is over-reliance on revenues and foreign exchange earnings from the sale of crude oil, even though the petrol represents just 10 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n\u201cMore so, the non-oil sector, particularly agricultural and manufacturing sectors, which contributes about 30 and 13 per cent to our GDP, have been confronted with low investments, inadequate credit to real sector and weak infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, with an annual population growth rate of 2.8 per cent, it was important that all efforts are made available for Nigerians, particularly in sectors that had the potential to absorb youths.\n\n\u201cWe were aware that if necessary support was given to households and business, productivity will rise and investment will flow into our economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele hinged the current economic downturn and hardship on the economic recession of 2015-2017 and the COVID-19 pandemic that led to revenue drop and reduction in foreign investment portfolio.\n\nIn his submission, Vice Chancellor of EKSU, Professor Edward Olanipekun, described the 40 years of the university as impactful in the life of the state, saying the university has been a reliable training ground for future leaders.\n\nOlanipekun said though the university was experiencing some challenges, no effort would be spared to keep the flag flying in its resolve to be a good citadel of learning for Nigerians.\n\nChairman of the occasion and Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Most Reverend Felix Ajakaye, urged the governments to be more pragmatic in the implementation of its policies for them to be impactful on the citizens.\n\n\u201cOur thought and actions must be practical-oriented. We have to go beyond lectures by being practical in dealing with policies that can benefit poor Nigerians,\u201d the Bishop advised.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria has been grappling with a myriad of security issues for over a decade. From the Boko Haram insurgency to banditry; farmer/herder crisis to kidnapping for ransom \u2014 it appears the country and its military are overwhelmed by these challenges.\n\nEducation, health, economy and most importantly, human lives have been greatly affected by these challenges, especially at a time when inflation, rising fuel and gas prices are biting hard on Nigerians.\n\nArguably all states in the country have had their fair share of security challenges but some states, especially those in the northern region, have had it worse. Kaduna is one of such states that have been grounded and left without any safe means of interstate travel given the recent developments.\n\nABUJA-KADUNA ROAD ATTACKS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt first started with the roads \u2014 Abuja-Kaduna route \u2014 notorious for being a flash-point of kidnappings. In August 2019, three final-year students of the faculty of law, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, were kidnapped on Abuja-Kaduna expressway.\n\nFour months earlier, in April, Mahmood Abubakar, chairman of the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), and his daughter were kidnapped on the road.\n\nIn another instance, eight students of ABU were abducted during an attack on motorists along the road in November 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe students, from the department of French, were travelling to Lagos for a programme at the Nigerian French Language Village (NFLV), Badagry, when the suspected bandits struck.\n\nSagir Hamida, Zamfara governorship aspirant in the 2019 election, was killed by gunmen in November 2021 during an attack on Abuja-Kaduna highway where several travellers were abducted.\n\nIn November 2021, the house of representatives asked Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff, and Alkali Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP), to \u201ctake speedy action\u201d to curb attacks on Abuja-Kaduna highway.\n\nTHEN THE RAIL ATTACKS BEGAN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated the Abuja-Kaduna train service in July 2016 but its patronage was low until 2018 when activities of kidnappers surged on the expressway.\n\nIt appeared that travellers had finally found succour as both the rich, the middle class and poor Nigerians abandoned the roads for the bandits and boarded the trains for their safety.\n\nTheCable had reported how kidnappers made the elite abandon their cars for Abuja-Kaduna trains.\n\nIn 2019, Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, said the daily passenger traffic on the Abuja-Kaduna rail line had tripled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was only a matter of time before the attackers evolved their tactics and began attacking the trains and rail tracks.\n\nIn October 2021, suspected bandits damaged a section of the track and shattered the window of the driver\u2019s compartment on the train which took off from the Idu station at 6 pm and was en route to Kaduna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA similar incident was said to have played out the next day and Shehu Sani, former senator representing Kaduna central, said it \u201ctook a miracle\u201d for them to escape.\n\n\u201cYesterday, terrorists attacked the Kaduna Abuja railway with an explosive & opened fire on the train, targeting the Engine Driver & the Tank,\u201d Sani had tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the development, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) shut down services on the Abuja-Kaduna route.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, suspected gunmen attacked a train around Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna. The assailants were said to have blown up the rail track after which they launched an attack on the passengers.\n\nThe locomotive was said to have over 900 passengers on board.\n\nSeveral travellers were injured during the attack and there are unconfirmed reports of casualties.\n\nThe UK\u2019s travel advice lists Abuja-Kaduna highway as \u201cparticularly prevalent\u201d for criminal activities. The US also lists Kaduna as a high-risk area owing to kidnapping.\n\nThe NRC has again, suspended train operations on the route.\n\nEVEN AIR TRAVEL IS NOT SAFE\n\nTransportation by air is dubbed the safest form of transportation but that may not be the case for Kaduna travellers. Having been chased from the roads and railway by bandits, those who can afford to travel by air are not assured of safety.\n\nOn Saturday, gunmen attacked the Kaduna international airport and killed a security guard.\n\nThe attack came hours after gunmen reportedly killed several residents across nine communities in Giwa LGA on Friday. According to Amina Salami, the airport manager, the gunmen fired shots into the runway from the fence area. Subsequently, the Nigerian Army said 12 of the gunmen that attacked the airport were killed in an airstrike. Meanwhile, Azman Air has announced the suspension of flights to Kaduna over the recent attack on the airport. An Azman Air flight was said to have been delayed for 44 minutes as a result of the incident, but passengers on the aircraft flew safely from Kaduna to Lagos. THE IRONY OF SAFETY About an hour before news of the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train broke, Lai Mohammed, minister of information, said the government is proud that Nigerians can travel safely by rail. According to him, the federal government has done well in ensuring safety via rail transport. \u201cWe are proud that in our time, Nigerians are once again able to travel by rail, this time in total comfort and safety,\u201d Mohammed said. His statement came despite the several attacks and other challenges that have bedevilled rail transport in the country.\n\nIS THE MILITARY STILL WINNING THE WAR AGAINST INSECURITY?\n\nThe Nigerian military has claimed in several instances that it is on top of the situation and it is winning the war against insecurity in the country \u2014 even though day-to-day realities show otherwise.\n\nOn March 5, Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff, assured Nigerians that peace will return to troubled parts of the nation this year.\n\n\u201cNever again will we have the level of insecurity that we have had in the past and this is an assurance,\u201d Irabor said.\n\nThe information minister also said in August 2021 the government is winning the war against insurgents.\n\n\u201cThis is what people should appreciate about fighting terrorism. The good news is that insurgents today are surrendering in droves and we are going after them. The truth of the matter is that the Nigerian government is winning the war against insurgents,\u201d had Mohammed said.",

          "text": "Buy now pay later (BNPL)\u2014a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees\u2014is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, BNPL activity is beginning to take shape and one of the pioneers in this space, CredPal, on Tuesday announced that it\u2019s raised $15 million in a bridge round comprising equity and debt. This will be used to expand its consumer credit offerings in its home country, Nigeria, and scale across Africa.\n\nLaunched in 2018 by CEO Fehintolu Olaogun and COO Olorunfemi Jegede, Y Combinator- and Google-backed CredPal allows individuals and businesses to pay for purchases in instalments across online and offline merchants, for both large and small-ticket items\u2014from as low as \u20a62,000 up to \u20a65 million. CredPal claims to have over 85,000 active customers and more than 4,000 active merchants.\n\nIn addition to providing infrastructure that allows banks and other financial institutions to deliver consumer credit in real-time, CredPal offers its customers access to credit cards, which was launched in November 2020.\n\nWhen it comes to credit cards, the frequent user wins!\n\n\n\nThe more you use your credit card, the more your reward \u2013 from 1% to 15% across our partnered merchants!\n\n\n\nImagine being rewarded for spending! pic.twitter.com/PCekh7M5oZ \u2014 CredPal (@CredPal) November 26, 2020\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is encapsulate the lifestyle of the average working-class Nigerian and ensure that every person can find something specifically for them on CredPal,\u201d Olaogun said in a recent interview. \u201cFor instance, a professional who earns \u20a6250,000 can get a credit card with a limit that they can pay back at the end of their billing cycle or use it to buy now and pay later.\u201d\n\nWith the new funding, the startup plans to extend partnerships with merchants through its recently deployed CredPal Pay, an omnichannel merchant suite that allows businesses seamlessly accept buy now, pay later. The point-of-sale infrastructure enables BNPL through various means, including a credit payment link, checkout plugin, QR codes, and a transaction management system.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to better credit facilities for African consumers and helping sellers grow their sales is getting a huge boost with these latest milestones,\u201d Olaogun says in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe latest funding brings the total investment secured by CredPal to $16.7 million, per Crunchbase data, having previously raised $1.5 million in 2020, part of which was used to roll out its credit cards.\n\nParticipating in this bridge round are existing investors, including Greenhouse Capital (which is also an investor in Kenya\u2019s BNPL startup Lipa Later), as well as new backers including Uncovered Fund, LongCommerce, First Circle Capital, and Adii Pienaar, co-founder and former CEO of WooCommerce.\n\nCredit Direct Limited, a subsidiary of First City Monument Bank (FCMB), provided the debt facility along with a few other financial institutions.\n\nCredPal co-founders Fehintolu Olaogun (left) and Olorunfemi Jegede.\n\nThe funding announcement coincides with a new partnership with Airtel Nigeria to enable consumers across Nigeria to access BNPL to own smartphones and broadband modems, CredPal says, without sharing specific details about the deal.\n\nThe fresh investment will also support the startup\u2019s planned expansion across Africa, starting with Kenya, Egypt, Ghana, and Cameroon, the company said.\n\nWith the bulk of African consumers severely starved of efficient and sustainable credit solutions, the BNPL movement is waxing strong across the continent and so is the competition among players.\n\nLipa Later is one of the early companies in the space in Kenya and there is M-Kopa\u2014which has since expanded into phones and retail products\u2014in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria. CDCare, PayQart, and Carbon also play in Nigeria. And in South Africa, there are PayJustNow and Payflex. The latter was recently acquired by Australian BNPL Zip.\n\nWhile competition appears to be heating up, there is a significantly large market of consumers and merchants to be tapped. But success will largely be determined by how effectively players can drive the adoption and use of credit financing and cards by African consumers.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "summary": "The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech.\nThis was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else.\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro.\nHe doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\nIf you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.",

          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

In the past year, it has placed a limit on International transactions when using a naira card, and it keeps reducing that limit.\n\nFirst, it was $200 a month, then it was reduced to $100, $50, and, I hope my eyes are deceiving me, $20 a month.\n\nOn paper, policies like these are intended for good effects, but things are not so straightforward in Nigeria. Paying for subscriptions is about to become tedious and the only winners would be the black market.\n\nWell, what do I know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nNigerian proptech problems\n\nFantasy football in MENA\n\nMeta\u2019s role in Kenya\u2019s elections\n\nA sour day for Nigerian proptech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Alexander Trukhin on Unsplash\n\nOn one hand, there\u2019s a housing deficit in Nigeria\u2019s most populous city, Lagos; and on the other, there\u2019s the affordability challenge, further tilting the supply-demand scale out of the reach of the house-hunter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to miss Oluwanifemi\u2019s voice as she laments about the perils of house hunting in Lagos on a recent episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast \u2013 Hope as a Service \u2013 a struggle she, myself, and our newest teammate, Michael, have befriended.\n\nNow, imagine a startup assuring you that you can get an apartment with ease and conveniently pay your rent monthly at an affordable rate? Sounds too good to pass up on right? Well, I, personally, never looked at it twice.\n\nA certain Nigerian startup, Rent Small Small, made such a promise to Nigerians sometime in 2019. However, following a recent investigation by Technext, the proptech startup has repeatedly reneged on these promises leaving its customers with sour stories.\n\nRead the full story: Infections, substandard materials, exclusive emails reveal Rent Small Small\u2019s disregard for customer satisfaction\n\nThe investigative piece exposed sub-par practices and leadership negligence from the startup.\n\nIf anything, this once again puts a big question on how much impact proptech startups can have on Africa\u2019s housing problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHow deep does this rot run? Why solving Nigeria\u2019s housing problem is beyond proptech startups for now\n\nMeta\u2019s role in Kenya\u2019s elections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s election time again, and Facebook parent company, Meta, has found itself in the thick of things again.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? Kenya\u2019s elections are coming up in August 2022, and we\u2019re gearing up for presidential, legislative, and county-level elections.\n\nLast week, Meta promised to let people know who is running a political ad they see on the platform; while equipping political advertisers with tools to reach their supporters. It also promises to verify advertisers before allowing them to place ads.\n\nThe ads, according to the tech giant, will be placed on a searchable database to aid fact-checking and transparency.\n\nProbably unrelated: In February 2022, Mozilla Foundation alleged that Spanish Advocacy group, CitizenGO, had been paying Kenyan influencers between $10 \u2013 $15 to spread misleading information about two important bills currently undergoing discussions in the Kenyan parliament.\n\nThe big picture: I probably don\u2019t need to state that social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are becoming forces of nature. With such power, comes great responsibility, and these platforms seem to be putting the gears in place to fight against misinformation.\n\nBut there are significant questions that need to be answered. Should big, primarily profit-driven, corporations be the custodians and watchdogs of marquee moments in a society like elections?\n\nThe shadow of Cambridge Analytica, one of the biggest global scandals in recent memory, looms large whenever election conversations come up.\n\nThis has led to the Web3 buzz, which aims for a more decentralised and collaborative Internet. Even Elon is reportedly \u201cgiving serious thought\u201d to a platform that adheres to free speech.\n\nBut we\u2019re left with the question \u201d Who decides what and why?\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to more joyful stories.\n\nFunding for fantasy football\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the news: Egyptian fantasy football startup, Eksab, has raised $3m to expand its fantasy football platform across MENA and Africa.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Saying football fandom is a big deal in Africa is probably an understatement. I can\u2019t count the number of times our Lead Sub-editor, Precious, has used a football analogy to explain several personal situations and it sticks like glue.\n\nFantasy football is also becoming a bigger deal as it gives football fans the opportunity to immerse themselves in the beautiful game like never before, and make money while doing so.\n\nGo deeper in the news: Eksab gets $3M to scale its fantasy football platform across MENA and Africa\n\nThe big picture: While betting platforms are popular in Africa, fantasy football companies have not yet poured out in droves. While startups like Draftkings and Fanduel grace countries like Canada, few people are recreating such experiences for the millions of football fans in Africa.\n\nHowever, while the English Premier League and other European leagues have dominated fandom in Africa, support for local football remains relatively minimal.\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nElon Musk thinking about creating a new social media platform\n\nThe US Admitted a Group of Russians at the Border Under Secret Deal With Mexico\n\nThe race to be India\u2019s electric vehicle capital\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nEurope appears to be gearing up for some interesting times with its new Digital Markets Act. The law aims to allow smaller messaging platforms to access the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the messaging world.\n\nIf it ends up getting implemented by October, this could mean that messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and iMessage could become interoperable.\n\nBasically, you might be able to send messages on WhatsApp to someone on Telegram or unlike the current exclusive use case of the iMessage platform, from iMessage to Facebook Messenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t get too excited yet, though. According to The Verge, \u201cthe language in the press release is unclear on whether the big apps would have to work together.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, today I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nRide-sharing newcomer\u2019s launch in Lagos, and\n\nThe correlation between Right of Way charges and Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\nHytch launches in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, during my compulsory national youth service, to save transportation costs, I hitchhiked part of the way to my office. Not the safest option, but certainly one of the cheapest. Basically, I stood by the side of the road and hailed strange cars going in the same direction I was going.\n\nUnfortunately, due to some stern African parent \u2014 I feel this phrase is tautological \u2014 warnings, I couldn\u2019t continue.\n\nFor Laolu Onifade, the journey to hitchhiking was a little different. Borne out of unpleasant experiences with ride-hailing companies, he got three other friends to join in his desire to build a ride-sharing platform that connects drivers and riders going in the same direction.\n\nOn Friday, March 25, 2022, Hytch \u2014 Onifade\u2019s ride-sharing platform \u2014 was publicly launched and currently operates in Lagos State.\n\nBut how does Onifade hope to ensure user safety and prevent stern African parent warnings? I spoke with him a few days ago, and among other things, we discussed Hytch\u2019s safety measures and plans.\n\nYou can find it here: Ride-sharing newcomer, Hytch is providing a new way to travel, hitchhiking style\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight of Way charges disrupt Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome interesting news: On Friday, March 25, 2022, the Nigerian Federal Government directed state governors to remove Right of Way (RoW) barriers to fast-track the expansion and strengthen the national grid.\n\nWhy? According to the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, issues with RoW has stalled 32 transmission projects across Nigeria worth $137 million.\n\nAn age-long problem: Before now, the federal government has made some inroads into challenges surrounding RoW charges. In 2017, the National Executive Council (NEC), approved a policy, which resulted in an RoW Charge Agreement reached with all the governors of the 36 states of Nigeria.\n\nThis agreement was meant to harmonise charges across board but has yet to materialise enough changes in the system with some states increasing their tariffs.\n\nRoW charges affect the overall amount telcos spend in laying optic fibre and eventually affect the cost of calls and Internet data. Now, it appears it could also be affecting electricity transmission as well.\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen federal government directives on the issue, and it remains to be seen if any changes will occur.\n\nMeanwhile, for your reading pleasure: When calls and data could get cheaper for Nigerian states that slashed RoW charges\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nWoke up to Elton John\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart ringing in my head and went on an oldies path for the rest of the day.\n\nSome lessons on patience, albeit from a footballing perspective.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I understand the concept yet, but this video about understanding dimensions was an interesting watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a 9-5er with great colleagues who own cars, you are probably already familiar with the concept of hitching a ride. Let\u2019s say your office is in Ikeja, you live in Surulere, and your colleague who also lives in Surulere has a car. So, you tend to get a ride with them, sometimes paying for fuel, saving you quite a bit of money that you\u2019d have spent on transport.\n\nBut what if you could hitch a ride with a stranger going in the same direction? Doesn\u2019t sound too safe, right? Especially if you\u2019ve been following the recent news on social media about insecurity on some ride-hailing and even government-owned transport systems.\n\nWell, Laolu Onifade thinks he might have found a sweet spot with his newly launched ride-sharing startup, Hytch.\n\nBut what does Hytch do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaolu Onifade, Hytch Founder\n\nAccording to Onifade, Hytch connects car owners and passengers going in the same direction. Using our earlier example, say you\u2019re trying to get to Berger from Surulere, all you have to do is launch the app, find drivers within a 2-3km radius going in that direction and, voila, you\u2019ve \u201chytched\u201d a ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar to the defunct GoMyWay, the ride is shared with three other riders going in the same direction, making the fare cheaper\n\nModelled after popular ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber, Hytch doesn\u2019t own any of the cars on the platform and only onboards drivers, with certain safety restrictions \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 built in to prevent mishaps.\n\nHytch takes a 15% commission off every ride and operates a cashless payment method. All users \u2014 drivers and passengers \u2014 have a wallet, so passengers are automatically debited the amount for the trip when it ends.\n\nThe idea for Hytch was birthed between 2019 and 2020, following Onifade\u2019s frustrations with ride-hailing platforms.\n\n\u201cI have encountered this problem myself moving around and with Uber being so expensive; I\u2019ve had this problem with Uber since 2019/2020. I noticed that Uber and Bolt were getting so expensive and I used to wonder, how about I just hitch a ride?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be in someone\u2019s car? Sometimes when I\u2019m in an Uber that\u2019s costing me say \u20a65,000, I don\u2019t mind sharing the ride with three other people in the back seat going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nRoping in his friends, Femi Omoniyi (CTO), Olawale Adeyeye (Chief Imagineer), and Kemdirim Akujobi (Product and Design Lead), they began building Hytch in 2021.\n\nAfter several months of beta testing, which saw them onboard 200 people, Hytch comes out of stealth mode today, with the app available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring user safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week Friday, March 18, 2022, this tweet by twitterer, @_kimaura set Nigeria\u2019s Twitter streets ablaze.\n\nso guys, i got robbed on wednesday night at ikoyi by my bolt driver, he took my phone, my cards, my ID, all my money and savings, lemme tell you how it happened. I ordered a bolt ride going to lekki, after i got into the ride which was a heavily tinted car and we started \u2026 \u2014 KIMBORO\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf51 (@_kimaura) March 18, 2022\n\n@_kimaura described being robbed by the Bolt driver who took her phone, debit cards, and IDs, among other things. Barely a month after the tragic death of Oluwabamise Ayanwole on a BRT in Lagos, it was enough to cause an uproar, with many people narrating various incidents.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @ade_IDD, narrated how she was almost kidnapped by a Bolt driver whose appearance was different from the picture on the platform. He told her that he was using his brother\u2019s account because his had been blocked.\n\nSo @Boltapp_ng i have strength today. I ordered a ride from school to my house yesterday Friday 18th of march and i got a driver. He came and i confirmed car type and number plate and i put my stuff in the car and he started the ride. \u2014 AdaUgo.\ud83e\udd84\u2728Busiswadede. \ud83e\udd75 (@ade_IDD) March 19, 2022\n\nThankfully, she got to safety, before anything untoward happened.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, another user, @shugadupri reported encountering the same driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while Bolt\u2019s support team acknowledged some complaints on Twitter, it is yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nTechpoint Africa asked Onifade how Hytch hopes to ensure user safety.\n\nOnifade explained that user safety is provided for both drivers and riders.\n\n\u201cFor drivers, we verify driver\u2019s licence. For riders, you have to take a picture at the moment. So that means, the same picture you take at the time that you are signing up is what the driver is going to use to recognise you. So you have to make sure you\u2019re taking an actual picture or else the driver is not going to pick you up.\n\n\u201cYou also have to put in your legal first and last name while signing up.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that it is an actual picture, Hytch has partnered with Nigerian digital compliance and security company, IdentityPass, plugging in an API that determines whether it is a human face.\n\nFor added security, the driver and rider are sent a pin which both users must confirm on the app before a trip commences. This could also prevent issues of drivers starting trips before arriving.\n\nLike other ride-hailing/ride-sharing companies, Hytch provides a panic button that enables users to alert family and friends when they are in danger.\n\nWhere a rider receives a streak of three bad ratings, they are automatically blocked from using the app, although they can be reinstated. The driver would have to reach out to get the account unblocked after an investigation is carried out.\n\nOnifade said there are currently plans to include National Identification Number (NIN) verification as a security measure; however, he agrees this could be limiting for users with no NIN.\n\nThere\u2019s still much for the startup to do with plans to eventually include interstate travel and as Onifade laughingly told Techpoint Africa, the ability to book a seat on a private jet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "Telcos sink under burden of multiple taxes",
          "text": "On 7 March 2022, officials of Onigbongbo Local Council Development Area (LCDA, in Lagos, served a notice to a Base Tower Station (BTS) operator for allegedly failing to pay fumigation, parking, and Radio, TV levies.\n\nCiting Section 12(1) of Local Government levies approved collection law of 2010, the LCDA claimed the operator was indebted to the sum of N450,000.\n\nBusinessDay gathered from other operators that the fumigation levy is not only common for BTS sites it is also being asked for by other states across the country. By implication, an operator with two or more sites in the same or multiple LCDAs or LGAs faces millions of naira in costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, 29 March 2022, telecom operators under the aegis of the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), said there was a possibility that telecom facilities in Kogi, Abuja, and other nine states could be shut down over disputes arising from unusual taxes and levies demanded by the state governments.\n\nA statement signed by Gbenga Adebayo, Chairman of the association, and Gbolahan Awonuga, Chairman, Head, Operations, warned that the issue was likely to lead to a total communications blackout in the entire Kogi State, parts of Abuja and possible impact on service availability in some parts of Nasarawa, Benue, Enugu, Anambra, Edo, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, and Niger states. These are states sharing borders with Kogi State.\n\nIn Nasarawa State, telecom operators are required to pay N20 million every year as a development levy and the state will still charge each employer resident in the state the same levy.\n\nExperts told BusinessDay that the development fee levy has been going on for a long time and gets worse every election cycle when politicians are looking for money for elections. In Kogi, Niger, and Rivers states there is an employee development levy charged on telecom operators. The fee ranges from N200 per employee to N35 million on total employee assessment.\n\nRead also: Inaccurate and unavailable data remain a concern for Nigeria\n\n\u201cMost operators challenge the illegal ones. Of course, the court process takes forever and unless you get a court order they seal up the site or the office,\u201d said Rotimi Akapo, Partner and Head, Telecommunications, Media and Technology Practice Group, Advocaat Law Practice.\n\nHowever, there have been some court wins for operators who took the legal route. For example, in one case brought by a telecom operator against the Akwa Ibom State government and Uyo Local Government in 2020, the Court of Appeal declared the Taxes and Levies (Approved List for Collections) Act, 2004 as void and unconstitutional due to the fact that its Sections 1 and 2 purported to override the CFRN 1999 (as amended). The implication, Akapo explains, is that each level of government is restricted to collecting taxes and charges only on the matters in respect of which they can legislate pursuant to the Legislative Lists specified in the constitution.\n\nAn executive in one of the telecommunication companies who would not be named because he is not the official spokesperson of the company said at the last count, operators were saddled with about 32 different taxes and this is choking the life out of investment in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cHow do you keep investing in a community that does nothing but slap you with frivolous taxes and levies? If you fail to pay they destroy the same infrastructure you installed to ensure they get quality service,\u201d the executive said.\n\nClassification of telecom taxes\n\nTaxes and levies in the telecommunication sector are broadly categorised into customs and general taxes. Custom taxes are the taxes imposed on goods when they are transported across international borders. In other words, they are levied on the import and export of goods. The government uses this duty to raise its revenues, safeguard domestic industries, and regulate the movement of goods.\n\nWole Abu, CEO of Liquid Telecom Nigeria explains that the rate of customs duty varies depending on where the goods were made and what they were made of. The federal government levies customs on most imports into Nigeria. The import duty may vary from 5 percent to 60 percent and on average is about 12 percent. Imports are also subject to a 7 percent port charge and a 7.5 percent value-added tax (VAT). Telecoms custom tax is levied on all equipment imported into the country such as cells, towers, antenna, etc. Custom taxes are administered by the Nigeria Customs Service. Excise duties are charged for domestic and imported handsets.\n\nGeneral Tax in the telecoms sector includes transactional taxes other than yearly taxes in the course of the ordinary business. Transactional taxes include VAT at 7.5 percent on all services rendered, Withholding Taxes at various rates between 5 percent to 10 percent depending on the nature of transactions, Capital Gain Tax at 10 percent if any upon sale of the company\u2019s assets. Yearly taxes include Company Income Taxes at 30 percent on the company\u2019s profit for the year (adjusted) and education taxes of 2.5 percent on similar profits resulting in a total annual exposure of 32.5% taxes on yearly profits. General taxes are administered by the Federal Internal Revenue Services.\n\n47 telecom taxes\n\nRotimi Akapo and Quasim Odunmbaku identify 47 taxes and levies paid by telcos to the three levels of governments in Nigeria in their new book \u2018Nigerian Telecommunications Law and Regulations\u2019.\n\nUsually, the law establishing the tax will state the collecting authority. For example. The Companies Income tax act states that it is to be collected by the FIRS. so the tax goes to the federal government and the Pay as you Earn (PAYE) is collected by the state tax authorities and so goes to states.\n\nThe other collecting authorities include states inland revenue services, Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), Nigerian Pension Commission (PENCOM), National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP), Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Federal Ministry of Works, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Nigerian Customs Service, Federal Ministry of Environment, National Civil Aviation Authority, NESREA, other ministries and departments in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is solely responsible for collecting four out of the 47 taxes and levies. The taxes the FIRS collects include the Companies Income Tax (30%), Withholding Tax (5%-10%), Value Added Tax (7.5%), and Capital Gains Tax (10%). The FIRS and states revenue services collect Stamp Duties (2.25% dependent on the transaction).\n\nThe states and LGAs are involved in the collection of 32 taxes and levies, including Personal Income Tax, Right of Way charges, business premises, planning permit, site inspection fees, location plan/site analysis report fees, plan approval fees, building permit, environmental fees, tenement rates, signage and advert fees, fire service fee, parking permits, effluent discharge, social services levy, employee development levy, operational permit, building fitness, capitation fee, infrastructure maintenance, hawking permit, way levy, shop rate, radio & TV licence, environmental/ecological fees, sewage fees, state environmental impact assessment, audit fees, gaseous emission, industrial generators & toxic emission, and installation of new telecommunication mast.\n\nIn many cases, the collection of payments \u2013 often through intimidation and harassment \u2013 by state and local governments agencies are done without appropriate legal backing. The schemes are carried out through the sale of stickers, mounting of roadblocks, and the use of revenue agents, consultants including motor park touts. Experts say that while the schemes have been going on for a long time, it gets worse every election cycle when politicians are looking for money for elections.\n\nGovernment collects while consumers suffer\n\nDuring the COVID-10 pandemic when other sectors shut down, the telecommunication industry proved to be the goose that lays the golden eggs. The pandemic made telecom services so critical to business survival that nearly every company now has or is in the process of developing a digital strategy.\n\nThe industry contributed over 81.5 percent of the total 15.5 percent of the ICT sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP. VAT collection in telecommunications has been a major contributor to government revenue in the sectors of which they are disallowed from claiming VAT input on their output. All services rendered by telecommunications are subject to VAT of 7.5 percent, which is administered by FIRS.\n\nTelecom\u2019s sector importance and potential for revenue is the reason why it is highly regulated by the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cRecently, major tax reforms are made in the country through the Finance Act 2020 and 2021 in tune with economic realities for respective industries and to generate more revenues for the government and bring taxpayers in the Tax net of the government,\u201d Abu told BusinessDay.\n\nBut multiple taxes hurts the government\u2019s digital plan. Most are transferred to the consumers one or the other contributing to growing digital divide and constituting a drag on financial inclusion.\n\nAjibola Olude, Executive Secretary and Chief Operating Officer of the Association for Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ATCON) identifies the impact on poor access to digital technology in the rural areas and poor spread of telecom infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Tax System needs to be looked at and structured in a way that it would earmark the taxes that the telecom industry is supposed to pay,\u201d Olude said.",

          "text": "Within the last three months, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company has deducted about N697bn from its remittance to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to pay petrol subsidy, putting states in a tough financial position.\n\nTo meet up the shortfall created in their finances, states have resorted to owing government workers, rationing their pay or cutting their salaries, pushing many Nigerians deeper into poverty.\n\n\u201cThe estimated value shortfall of N127,035,585,356.25 is to be recovered from the January 2022 proceed due for sharing at the February 2022 FAAC meeting,\u201d the NNPC said in its presentation to FAAC in January.\n\nThe NNPC prefers to call petrol subsidy \u2018value shortfall\u2019 or \u2018under-recovery\u2019 in its documents.\n\nIn February, the national oil company said the estimated value shortfall of N242.53 billion was to be recovered from February proceed due for sharing at the March FAAC meeting.\n\nNNPC said in its presentation to FAAC this month said it would deduct N328 billion from March proceed.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe value shortfall of N219,783,148,011.13 was charged for the month which comprises of N195,975,376,910.12 for January 2022 plus part of the November 2021 spot cargo arrears of N23,807,771,101.00.\n\n\u201cThe estimated value shortfall of N328,004,248,900.01 (consisting of N253,004,248,900.01 for February 2022 recovery plus balance of November 2021 spot cargo arrears of N75,000,000,000.00) is to be recovered from the March 2022 proceed due for sharing at the April 2022 FAAC meeting.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of the FAAC presentations by BusinessDay indicates that deductions made by the NNPC to keep petrol prices within the N162-N165 price band are having detrimental impact on the finances of states.\n\nIn March 2021, it was estimated that between N70 billion and N210 billion would be spent every month to keep petrol price at N162/litre (below import parity cost), and remittances to FAAC would shrink to less than N50 billion per month or even zero if trends persist.\n\nRead also: Reining in the collapse of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry\n\nBy November 2021, the cost of the petrol subsidy rose to around N250 billion per month.\n\nThe country has not benefitted from the significant rise in oil prices because oil production has declined and petrol subsidy is increasing.\n\nState governments are embarking on tough fiscal measures to make their monthly allocations last longer. In Kano, civil servants and political appointees suffered cuts in their February salaries.\n\nIn Kogi, salaries are rationed to civil servants and political appointees. Government workers are receiving what the government called a staggered amount. Their counterparts in Ondo State were last paid salaries in December.\n\n\u201cThe federation will continue to bear the shortfall due to differentials between the current PMS retail price and actual open market price, unless PMS pricing is fully deregulated,\u201d said a report by the National Economic Council Ad-hoc Committee, chaired by Nasir El-Rufai, Kaduna state governor.\n\nThe report said FAAC have therefore continued to shrink further as NNPC recovers shortfall quite arbitrarily from the federation\u2019s crude oil sales revenue.\n\nIt noted that as at May 2021, Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production and revenues had been impacted by the daily cut of about 500,000 barrels per day due to compliance with OPEC+ since May 2020 and a soaring value shortfall due to under-pricing of petrol against cost of supply.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may have implemented cuts but Nigeria has been unable to meet its allocated quota. Production has hovered around 1.4 million bpd due to above-the-ground challenges which has since worsened due to crude theft in the Niger Delta.",

          "text": "The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), on Monday, said it conducted a detailed functionality and user acceptance test on the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), a payment platform proposed by Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), and found some fundamental flaws despite the platform recording a 99.3 percent pass.\n\nNITDA said it conducted a total of 687 test cases, in which 529 passed, 156 failed, and two cautionary warnings were recorded.\n\n\u201cAs some of the failed cases are critical to the overall functionality of the solution, the agency could not recommend for the solution to be deployed in a production environment. ASUU was, therefore, requested to work on the solution and submit it for further assessment,\u201d NITDA said in a statement.\n\nASUU has been on strike since February 14, 2022 because the Federal Government is insisting that it would only pay salaries using the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). The striking lecturers are, however, vehement that they would not be subjected to the federal payment platform, and that they would rather prefer to be paid using the UTAS.\n\nASUU\u2019s insistence on a separate payment platform is due to distrust of the sincerity of the authorities to sufficiently deal with the many problems bedevilling the education system from inception.\n\nFollowing several interventions from many stakeholders including the National Assembly, the government said it would only accept the UTAS should it pass the functionality and user acceptance test. As a result of the decision, the government turned to NITDA for help on October 14, 2020.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers it to create a framework for the planning, research, development, standardization, application, coordination, monitoring, evaluation, and regulation of information technology practices in Nigeria.\n\nIn view of the mandate, the agency has over the years issued a series of regulatory instruments including the Software Testing and Quality Assurance Framework and Guideline, in 2016. The guideline \u2013 currently under review \u2013 provides for the design, development, and testing of software projects in Nigeria.\n\nSection 10 of the Guidelines for Nigerian Content Development in ICT, 2019, details guidelines and expectations for indigenous software development and software-enabled products and services.\n\nSince NITDA issued the guideline, it has been registering indigenous software solutions, and part of the process requires that solutions are subjected to tests in line with the requirements of the Software Testing and Quality Assurance Framework and Guideline and the Guidelines for Nigerian Content Development in ICT.\n\nRead also: Nigerians fear ASUU strike could lead to academic apathy\n\nIt was in this light that NITDA was invited to participate in an interactive session between ASUU, the Federal Government, and the National Assembly at the Conference Hall of the Accountant General of the Federation\u2019s office. The meeting was an opportunity for ASUU to demonstrate the capabilities of the UTAS platform, according to sources.\n\nAs part of the government\u2019s conditions for acceptance of the UTAS as a payment platform for public universities, NITDA decided to carry out three out of the eight tests specified in the guidelines. The tests include User Acceptance Test; Stress Test; and Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Test.\n\nNITDA said its team carried out a series of Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Tests on the UTAS platform.\n\nIt said one of the assessments revealed five high-risk vulnerabilities that are likely to negatively impact the platform if exploited, adding that two low-risk vulnerabilities were identified.\n\nThe agency said these were discussed with the ASUU team, and a further assessment was carried out on the updated version of the UTAS, which it said showed that the high-risk vulnerabilities had been addressed.\n\n\u201cHowever, one medium risk, three low risks, and 44 informational risks were identified,\u201d it said.\n\nNITDA said it also adequately communicated to the relevant stakeholders including ASUU, adding that the entire interaction took about two weeks.\n\nIt said, \u201cIt is important to note that despite making all efforts to fast-track the exercise, it took the team two weeks of continuous interaction on a daily basis. There is no doubt that the exercise has positively impacted the functionality and robustness of the UTAS platform.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we believe that the interaction availed ASUU the opportunity to understand and appreciate NITDA\u2019s commitment and level of professionalism exhibited in carrying out its responsibilities.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, at the just concluded 2022 Doha Forum in Qatar, showcased business and investment opportunities in Edo State, rallying investors to take advantage of the business-friendly environment as well as incentives provided by his administration in the state to invest in new frontiers.\n\nObaseki, who joined other world leaders and policymakers at the 20th edition of the forum, showcased investment opportunities in different sectors of the state\u2019s economy including agriculture, healthcare, technology and education, among others.\n\nNoting that the COVID-19 pandemic further opened opportunities for investment in the state, Obaseki said, \u201cThe pandemic drained the capital of small and medium scale businesses, but this opened an opportunity for investment because most of them began using technology. This, in turn, has boosted tech startups, and young people in that space are now making a living working for companies outside the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration has recorded huge success in opening up the space for investment through pragmatic reforms in the state\u2019s industrial corridors, and in infrastructure, education, healthcare and security.\n\nObaseki said the state is sustaining investment in large-scale agricultural production and leveraging technology and the innovative potential of its youthful population to ensure food security and drive the state\u2019s post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery plan.\n\nHe further noted, \u201cThe Ukrainian war, for me, has created a real alarm for our food systems. With the increase in food prices, particularly, wheat, staples and grains, and the rise in energy prices, we as a government, have realized that we now have to put a lot of resources and time into agriculture, and large-scale agricultural projects.\n\n\u201cFortunately, in Edo State, we have started investment in palm oil and have rolled out programmes where we could bring in serious investment into large scale oil palm production as the trigger for large scale investment in agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the opportunities that we see in the next three years is to first secure our food supplies by food production and then utilize technology and focus on smaller businesses,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nThe governor further stated: \u201cFor us in Edo State, we didn\u2019t suffer much from the infections or mortality rate of the COVID-19 because of the very young population we have in Nigeria and Edo State. The infection wasn\u2019t so high and the mortality wasn\u2019t as bad as we get from malaria or other diseases.\n\n\u201cWhat really affected us was the disruption of livelihoods and with the lockdowns, a lot of small businesses were seriously affected and but the availability of technology as a response sprung up new opportunities for small businesses in particular.\n\n\u201cIn terms of our healthcare response, we realized the opportunities for investment in the healthcare space and the participation of the private sector in healthcare delivery. Before now, the bulk of healthcare investment was left to the government, even though the private sector is a key provider of healthcare services.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "In a bid to put the record straight for the interest of stakeholders and the general public and bring to a logical conclusion series of issues emanating from media statements about the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA)\u2019s role on the assessment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), NITDA says a detailed Functionality/User Acceptance Test on the platform was carried out by the agency\u2019s team; which revealed that a total of 687 test cases were generated in which 529 passed, 156 failed and two cautionary warnings.\n\nGiven the fact that some of the failed cases are critical to the overall functionality of the solution, the agency could not recommend for the solution to be deployed in a production environment which necessitated ASUU to work on the Solution and submit it for further assessment.\n\nTo further give credence to the outcome, a comprehensive report outlining all the tests carried out and issues identified was submitted to the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy on the 3rd December, 2021. This was in turn submitted to the chief conciliator, the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment as well as other stakeholders in ASUU.\n\nA statement by the agency\u2019s Head, Corporate Affairs and External Relations, Mrs Hadiza Umar, said as part of the process, NITDA held its first meeting with ASUU on 22nd October, 2020 and discussions centered on the modalities of the assessment.

This was in turn submitted to the chief conciliator, the Honourable Minister of Labour and Employment as well as other stakeholders in ASUU.\n\nA statement by the agency\u2019s Head, Corporate Affairs and External Relations, Mrs Hadiza Umar, said as part of the process, NITDA held its first meeting with ASUU on 22nd October, 2020 and discussions centered on the modalities of the assessment.

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Goodluck Jonathan and other African leaders yesterday, condemned military incursion into governance in some African countries and called on the regional and continental bodies to rise up to the challenge in order to consolidate on democratic gains achieved by the continent in the past few years.\n\nThe leaders made the remarks at the opening session of a high-level dialogue, organised by the Coalition for Dialogue on Africa (CoDA) which was held in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nIn his welcome address at the event, Obasanjo, who is the chairman of CoDA, condemned military takeover of democratically elected governments in some African countries, stressing that democracy in West Africa and indeed Africa required an urgent attention.\n\nSpeaking at the event where other African leaders had met to deliberate on how to strengthen democracy in West Africa, Obasanjo emphasized that only a peaceful democracy that has respect for the will of the people and the future of African nations remains the panacea for the continent\u2019s growth and not the kind of governance influenced by the judiciary or grabbing the power through the use of guns.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two-day event, themed: \u201cWest Africa: Rising to the Challenges of Consolidating Democratic Governance\u201d, was held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library in Abeokuta. The event had in attendance, former Vice President of Gambia, Fatoumata Tambajanb, former President of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma and Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, among others.\n\nWhy West Africa Has Had So Many Coups\u2026\n\nEmphasising that West Africa and indeed African continent are currently going through a perilous storm following political instability in some parts of the continent, the former president lamented that, coup d\u2019etat, election fraud and political violence and instability have crippled the growth of Africa.\n\nHe however, maintained that the only way the African continent can develop is through peaceful democratic transition of governments.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, we have witnessed a return of coup d\u2019etat, election fraud and political violence resulting in instability and threatening the developmental gains we have made in the last couple of decades.\n\n\u201cI feel very sad and it gives me great concern when I see the democratic system, we have painfully built collapsing. And I believe there must be a solution because the problem is human and all human problems can be solved by human beings.\n\n\u2018\u2019That is why the Coalition for Dialogue on Africa under my chairmanship and the OOPL have brought all of us together today to discuss pertinent issues affecting governance in West Africa, including the challenges and then to seek the way forward.\n\n\u201cAchieving this may not be easy but it is a must if we want our nation to make progress, it must entail responsible management of diversity which makes everyone feel a sense of belonging and be a significant part of the whole\n\n\u201cPeaceful coexistence has been a hallmark of Africans even before the emergence of the colonial era and we cannot accept anything less in this modern age.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe need a stable environment to grow our economies and ensure that countries develop in a sustainable way. Such an all-inclusive democratic environment will fast track developing our economy and will strengthen our security and promote general progress.\u201d\n\nIn his keynote address, Vice President Osinbajo called on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU) and other African organisations to rise up to the challenge and do more in ensuring political and economic stability of West Africa and Africa at large.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of peril for democracy in our region because we are navigating a perfect storm of adverse circumstances, a world economy that is reeling from recessional shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, price and supply disruption from the war in Ukraine, the emergency of armed non state actors, poor challenges associated with catering for the youngest populations in the world.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow our continent to become as it was in the cold war era. A fetter or proxy wars and great power conflict, we know from experience that this would result in a deepening or the recession of democratic values in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe militarisation of civil society whether by local military regimes or rival foreign military industrial complexes can only set us back by several decades.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to democratisation must be predicated on the aspiration of our people and not from the whims of foreign powers.\n\n\u201cThe recent spate of military coups across our continent and attempts at military coups not only potends the risk of a damaging democratic recession, but it also takes us back to the circles of extra constitutional disruptions that plagued us decades ago\u201d.\n\n\u201cSince 2017, there have been 12 military coups in Africa and half of them occurred since 2020. Two months ago, the democratically elected government of Burkina Faso was overthrown while only in February there was an attempted coup in Guinea Bissau which was thankfully repealed.\n\n\u201cThis much is clear, we know that we cannot secure the Africa that we want by turning back the hands of the democratic clock.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe have walked this thorny road before, many decades worth of bitter experience and an impeachable lesson of our history, a clear lesson of our history is that despotisms cannot guarantee the security and prosperity of our people.\n\n\u201cNo matter how dire our circumstances may be, we now have concrete proof that resorting to extra constitutional regimes is not the way forward,\u201d Osinbajo said.",

          "title": "Review of Rema's Rave & Roses Album",
          "text": "By Agwuma Kingsley\n\nRema\u2019s debut album Rave & Roses is worth the wait since the ending of 2021 when the anticipation began.\n\nThe superstar has secured a firm threshold as one of the core creators amongst the new generations, releasing three EP in the formative years of his career, and undoubtedly could be regarded as one of the most influential forces in his generation.\n\nAmongst the likes of Fireboy DML, Joeboy, Zlatan Ibile, Victor AD, and Lyta, Rema is part of the leading men round about this circle of creators, his former contenders at the 13th Headies Next rated category.\n\nIn 2019, when he was announced the winner of the category, he pronounced himself the future on the brimming stage of the 13th Headies at Eko Convention Centre In Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nRema\u2019s musical moves have been prevalent to this point. While he has leaped from one hit record to another, his career run has eventually got stock in the idea of fandom, fun, and peaking pleasure with women. This idea is a cut that Rave & Roses is carved from, it unfolds his vulnerabilities alongside his likes, it is the experiences he chose to deliver to us.\n\nRema weaves the story of his beginning upon lucid strings and kicks on the opening song, a cut made from his real name \u2013 \u201cDivine\u201d, which becomes an x-ray of his beginning right from birth.\n\n\u201cHold Me\u201d, is a love song and the influence of 6lack\u2019s input can\u2019t be underrated, it was perfect. There was chemistry meanwhile, Rema stories the love his woman shares with him promising he\u2019d bring her to his mother. Indeed it was practical.\n\n\u201cTime N Affection\u201d compliments its theme as Rema creates a love ballad that requests his woman should come and receive his time and affection including all his savings and pension, in quote, because he is in love. Chris Brown\u2019s input is worth carrying a great measure of pop Influence.\n\n\u201cAddicted\u201d, is a standout record on this album. \u201cAre You There?\u201d, is another standout track, a feel-good dancehall record with the rhythms unscrolling Rema\u2019s thoughts about his music and how listeners could perceive it.\n\nAnd to those criticizing his art as being on a focal point where women, lust, and sex is frequently talked about, Rema cleared the air singing that he can\u2019t focus on using his music to talk about the negative in his country and it is why he has to be positive, he isn\u2019t an activist either, he has the free will to use his music however he wants to and it\u2019s the truth.\n\nRema asked if you are there in the grooves that continued. Meanwhile, the music was golden. \u201cRunaway\u201d is another special song in which Rema sings his affection and love in a way that should define his experience as one that understands true love and affection, not only about sex and fandom.\n\n\u201cJo\u201d is a groove such as \u201cAre You There?\u201d, although not as serious but it\u2019s an attempt to make you roll on the dance floor. The mid-tempo \u201cMara\u201d is another love song that becomes an instrument he used to describe his woman and more. Aj Tracey is new to Afrobeat culture. However, Rema affirms unapologetic that he is taking the culture to the world. While the British singer-songwriter Aj Tracey is newly being introduced to Afro music, his delivery was worthy enough to elevate the culture to fresh demography in the UK.\n\n\u201cOroma Baby\u201d is the story about the woman he met along the line who seems to have ruined him with her love and then, he promises to grab her and not let go. He becomes a hunter to her. While the Spanish Yseult\u2019s effort on \u201cWine\u201d was good as well. The chemistry was a beautiful experience. \u201cCalm Down\u201d could be regarded as one of the best songs of the album alongside \u201cAddicted\u201d and \u201cAre You There?\u201d, they are this writer\u2019s favorites.\n\n\u201cSoundgasm\u201d as usual is an experience in Rema\u2019s creativity, the record portrays sexuality and fandom, even as the title of the song is a picture of a sound that has reached a climax state due to a sexual peak perhaps from Rema\u2019s vocal range which takes the sound to that level. Other songs were good.\n\nWhile the album is something colorful which means that it was so diverse naturally, in between Rema is focused on taking the culture to the faces of many listeners as well as expanding his creative range as a pop star.\n\nImagine an act that took feminine focal on an album and expressed it differently, it is genius and magical.",

The bandits were only passing behind the airport perimeter fence when they saw the security man engaged by NAMA and they fired at him. They just took advantage of that to pass a message.\u201d\n\nHe explained that even the first layer was not breached.\n\n\u201cSo, as you can see from the distance, the insinuation outside that the terrorists took over the Airport is not correct.

          "text": "The federal government Monday accused the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of misinformation capable of plunging the country into another round of the #EndSARS protests.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed made the accusation at a media parley in Abuja.\n\nHe queried: \u201cHow do you explain their threat of another EndSARS that pushed Nigeria to the brink? How do you explain their glaring misinformation regarding the nation\u2019s state of affairs?\u201d\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThe other side has been doing everything in recent times to overheat the polity, distort the achievements of our administration and spread misinformation. It is very cold out there for the hungry and desperate opposition.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in having a fiery and viable opposition in a democracy. We were there before and we remain the ones to beat in terms of a determined, viable and relentless opposition.\n\n\u201cHow else does one explain their court case seeking the declaration of our convention as illegal?\n\n\u201cBut, in our time, not once did we advocate the destruction of Nigeria just because we couldn\u2019t have our way. Not once did we seek to gain power via a desperate court action. If you destroy the country you are seeking to govern, what country will you govern? Must you cut your nose to spite your face?\n\n\u201cIn the most egregious show of shamelessness and a blatant refusal to be remorseful, they even had the audacity to express righteous indignation that the damage they inflicted on the country in their 16 years of misrule has not been totally undone in just seven years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, those who brought the country to its knees are now accusing those working hard to repair things of non-performance. They said they are ready to rescue Nigeria. Pray, where do kidnappers rescue their victims? These same guys who kidnapped the fortunes of their country are suddenly posing as rescuers. CAVEAT EMPTOR. Buyers beware! NIGERIANS BEWARE!\u201d\n\nThe PDP Friday asked a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, to stop the planned national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over alleged non-compliance with procedure and rules guiding the exercise.\n\nBut the governing ultimately held its convention Saturday, which through consensus, produced a former Nasarawa state governor and serving lawmaker, Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nThe PDP, in a suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/389 2022, also sought a court order deregistering the APC as a political party having failed to meet the requirements of Sections 222(a), 223(b) and 225 of the Nigerian constitution.\n\nIn the suit dated March 25 and filed by its counsel, Samuel Irabor, the party listed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the APC, Registered Trustees of the APC and the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee(CECPC) as defendants.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s anthology of lies\u2019\n\nIn its reaction, the PDP described the performance claims by Mohammed as another as another anthology of lies, false and bogus disinformation.\n\nIn a statement Monday by its national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, the party said the hurried press conference was another desperate and disoriented stunt by the APC administration to divert public attention from the exposed corruption records of the APC national leadership.\n\nIt also described it as \u201can attempt to downplay and treat with levity, the excruciating economic hardship, hunger and other life discounting experiences being faced by Nigerians daily because of severe food crisis, lingering fuel emergency, high cost of essential commodities and services, closure of schools, insecurity and mass killing, collapse of healthcare system and decayed public infrastructure under APC\u2019s watch.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cIt is the height of impunity and arrogance that the Minister of Information and Culture, could address the media to claim that the APC government has achieved food sufficiency, particularly in rice production, when in reality, there is famine in the land with the price of food items, especially rice soaring by over 400 percent under the APC with its \u201cpyramid of lies\u201d\n\nContinuing, the statement read: \u201cA bag of rice which sold for N7,500 under the PDP now sells for over N30,000, a measure of bean which sold for N350 under the PDP now sells for over N1000, a measure of garri which sold for N120 under the PDP now sells for N700, a bottle of palm oil which sold for N250 under the PDP now sells for over N1000.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, a kilo of meat which sold for N700 under the PDP now sells for N3000, a liter of petrol which sold for N87 under the PDP now sells for as high as N400 to N500 while a liter of diesel which sold for N110 under the PDP now sells for over N800, yet Lai Mohammed provocatively claims that Nigerians are better off under the APC.\n\n\u201cNigerians know better and the question to ask is, Is your life better now in 2022 under the APC than it was in 2015 under the PDP?\n\n\u201cIt is ludicrous and insensitive that the APC government went to the media to list non-existence roads, bridges, agricultural and health projects as achievements.\n\n\u201cMore pathetic is the APC\u2019s attempt to claim credit for development projects initiated and implemented by successive PDP administrations including in our railways, aviation, agricultural, healthcare, education, telecommunications, banking and manufacturing sactor among others.",

Separate pictures showed the businessman speaking to Turkish president Recep Tayipp Erdogan.\n\nMr Abramovich suffered symptoms of a poisoning earlier this month along with two Ukrainian peace negotiators during talks at the Ukraine-Belarus border, according to the Wall Street Journal . His symptoms included sore eyes and peeling skin, it is claimed.\n\nThe Foreign Office branded the reports \u201cvery concerning\u201d, while education minister Will Quince told Sky News that the Government would look to \u201cestablish the facts\u201d around the claims.\n\nUkraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday said Mr Abramovich had offered to help broker a peace deal with the Kremlin, with the oligarch reportedly making several trips to Kyiv at the start of the month.\n\nMr Zelensky has asked US officials to refrain from sanctioning Mr Abramovich, claiming he could play a role in helping to negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nEarlier this month, the British government froze Mr Abramovich\u2019s assets over his links to President Vladimir Putin \u2013 plunging his football club Chelsea FC into financial crisis.

          "text": "Air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine before dawn on Tuesday as Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Turkey for the first face-to-face talks in nearly three weeks, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan welcomed delegations from both sides saying that \u201cstopping this tragedy\u201d was up to them.\n\nUkrainian television reported the talks had begun with \u201ca cold welcome\u201d and no handshake between the delegations.\n\nUkraine and the United States hold little hope of an immediate breakthrough. But the resumption of face-to-face talks is an important first step towards a ceasefire in a Russian invasion that is stalled on most fronts but inflicting horrible suffering on civilians trapped in besieged cities.\n\nMore than a month into the war, the biggest attack on a European nation since World War Two, more than 3.8 million people have fled abroad, thousands have been killed and injured, and Russia\u2019s economy has been pummelled by sanctions.\n\nIn the besieged southern port city of Mariupol nearly 5,000 people have been killed, including about 210 children, according to figures from the mayor. Such figures cannot be verified.\n\nSurvivors have told harrowing tales of people dying from lack of medical treatment, bodies being buried wherever space could be found, and women giving birth in basements.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said of the talks in Turkey: \u201cWe are not trading people, land or sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe minimum programme will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum programme is reaching an agreement on a ceasefire,\u201d he said on national television.\n\nA senior U.S. State Department official said Russian President Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to make compromises to end the war.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said talks so far had not yielded any substantial progress but it was important they continued in person.\n\nFootage from inside the Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul where the talks took place showed Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in attendance, though it was not immediately clear in what role. Abramovich appears to have tried to act as a go-between, including during a trip to Ukraine early in the conflict when he and several Ukrainian negotiators are said to have fallen ill.\n\nCountrywide air raid sirens acros Ukraine were the latest sign of Russia\u2019s increasing reliance on long-range strikes, hitting targets far from front lines to try to cripple Ukrainian supply lines. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday it had struck a large fuel depot in the Rivne region of western Ukraine overnight, a long distance from any fighting.\n\n\u201cThe enemy continues to vilely carry out missile and bomb strikes in an attempt to completely destroy the infrastructure and residential areas of Ukrainian cities,\u201d the Ukraine military\u2019s general staff said. \u201c(They) focus on fuel storage facilities in order to complicate logistics and create the conditions for a humanitarian crisis.\u201d\n\nENERGY SUPPLIES\n\nIn an address on Monday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy repeated calls for the West to go further in punishing Moscow for its invasion.\n\n\u201cWe, people who are alive, have to wait. Doesn\u2019t everything the Russia military has done to date warrant an oil embargo?\u201d\n\nWhile Western countries have imposed hard-hitting sanctions upon Moscow, Europe is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia and has been so far reluctant to act to block them.\n\nU.S. and German government officials are due to meet in Berlin this week with energy industry executives to discuss ways to boost alternative supplies for Germany. The Kremlin has demanded the West pay for Russian gas in roubles, not euros, but is trying to decide a mechanism for this.\n\nTRAPPED\n\nIn besieged Ukrainian cities where conditions are desperate, the threat of Russian attacks has blocked exit routes for civilians. In Mariupol, the mayor said about 160,000 people were still trapped.\n\n\u201cThere is no food for the children, especially the infants. They delivered babies in basements because women had nowhere to go to give birth, all the maternity hospitals were destroyed,\u201d a grocery worker from Mariupol who gave her name only as Nataliia told Reuters after reaching nearby Zaporizhzhia.\n\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cdenazify\u201d its neighbour. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nSince the last in-person talks were held on March 10, when Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said a ceasefire was not even on the agenda, momentum on the battlefield has shifted in Ukraine\u2019s favour, giving Ukrainian officials some hope that Russia could be prepared to negotiate an end to fighting.\n\n\u201cWe have destroyed the myth of the invincible Russian army. We are resisting against the aggression of one of the strongest armies in the world and have succeeded in making them change their goals,\u201d Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.\n\nRussia\u2019s military signalled last week it would concentrate on expanding separatist-held territory in southeastern Ukraine. Kyiv says Russian troops continue to try to surround the capital, although Ukrainians have been pushing them back there, in the south and in the northeast.\n\nThe sides have held talks via video link in recent weeks and both have publicly discussed a formula under which Ukraine might accept some kind of neutral status.\n\nBut neither side has budged over Russia\u2019s territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and eastern territories known as the Donbas, which Moscow demands Kyiv cede to pro-Russian separatists.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economy No Longer Dependent on Oil, Says NNPC GMD Kyari",
          "text": "The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari, on Monday said the Nigerian economy had weaned itself off total dependence on oil revenues, unlike what was obtained in the past.\n\nSpeaking on Day 1 of the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi, Kyari, stated that presently, the contribution of the sector to the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was just nine per cent.\n\nKyari who elucidated on the need to give Africa special consideration in the movement away from fossil fuels, maintained that Nigeria was not ready for Electronic Vehicles (EVs) as it is currently dealing with basic issues of power supply.\n\nThe NNPC GMD argued that while Nigeria believes in the net zero drive and has already committed to it, it would continue to build on its gas infrastructure as a buffer before the achievement of the net zero target in 2060.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, let me put it in a general context, our country\u2019s GDP contribution from the oil and gas is just nine per cent. So, we are not really an oil-dependent economy. Secondly, the US Bureau of Statistics has estimated that by year 2047, Nigeria\u2019s population will be around 379 million people and will be the third most populous country in the world.\n\n\u201cThe combination of this is that you have a very rapidly growing population with a huge gap in terms of energy accessibility and you have a huge economic disparity between the poor and the rich and this is growing.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can take the context of energy transition out of this, but our country is clearly committed to net zero by 2060 to reduce our carbon footprint in a manner that will contribute to net zero by 2060,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari stressed that while Nigeria was trying to move its dependence on thermal sources of power to other sources of energy, more than 70 per cent of energy need was currently coming from the source.\n\n\u201cAnd most of them are not even coming from gas, so most of them are coming from fuel oil and other dirtier fuels,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat we are going to do is some kind of replacement so that we will move from the dirtier fuels to cleaner fuels which is gas, and therefore our focus is to see gas as a transition fuel.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, what Nigeria had tried to do in recent years was to build enormous gas infrastructure to ensure it is able to supply gas to the domestic market and export to the international market.\n\nHe explained that the energy poverty that Nigeria was confronted with, was also true of other African countries.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are trying to see how we can build a network of pipelines and infrastructure that will deliver gas throughout the West African region and potentially into Europe through Morocco and Algeria.\n\n\u201cWe are a 306tcf gas nation and this is enough to cover a lot of our needs in Africa, but our people still use charcoal as cooking fuel and that\u2019s the lowest fuel that you can put forward,\u201d he stressed.\n\nLamenting that public transportation was weak in Nigeria, Kyari stated that the only way to reduce the number of internal combustion engines was to increase the gas infrastructure and close the gap.\n\nHe noted that differentiation remains very critical as the world moves towards 2060, because different countries have peculiar circumstances.\n\nKyari added: \u201cTotal lack of investment in this sector will mean some kind of exclusion for a very large population in Africa and very many other nations. Therefore, this bandwagon approach to stop funding for fossil fuels won\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cThis is because, today, we have much more basic problems in Sub-Saharan Africa than worrying about EVs. We are not in the EVs age and definitely the electricity supply is still the weakest.\n\n\u201cLess than 30 per cent has access to clean electricity and you need to fill this gap. And there\u2019s no way the scale of investment in renewables will do this. So, the world must sit back and take a second look at this.\n\n\u201cCan we differentiate this? Can the cleaner energy come later for some countries? Can we fund fossil fuels so that resources can be available to some countries to fund the transition journey itself?\n\n\u201cAlso, can we segregate and say we want to fund gas in certain countries and certainly locations so they can provide cleaner, quicker and more practical fuels? Clearly, there has to be differentiation.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, argued that the role of oil and gas is guaranteed in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe world will continue to acquire all sources of energy. What is required at the moment is to revisit how we explore and consume hydrocarbons and to bring them in line with current realities, especially in terms of sustainability.\n\n\u201cThe energy trilemma: energy access, affordability and sustainability should be taken in the holistic manner. Oil and gas, according to our oil outlook, will continue to account for more than 45 per cent to 50 per cent of the global energy mix.\n\n\u201cThis number has not changed in the last 30 to 40 years because population has been growing rapidly over 3 per cent. we project that potential to grow till 2045 and the vast majority of that growth will come from developing countries where energy poverty is already epidemic,\u201d he stated.",
          "summary": "The NNPC GMD argued that while Nigeria believes in the net zero drive and has already committed to it, it would continue to build on its gas infrastructure as a buffer before the achievement of the net zero target in 2060.\n\u201cFirst of all, let me put it in a general context, our country\u2019s GDP contribution from the oil and gas is just nine per cent.\nHe explained that the energy poverty that Nigeria was confronted with, was also true of other African countries.\n\u201cThe energy trilemma: energy access, affordability and sustainability should be taken in the holistic manner.\nOil and gas, according to our oil outlook, will continue to account for more than 45 per cent to 50 per cent of the global energy mix.",

          "title": "Information Minister Lai Mohammed Blames Opposition PDP for Laying Foundation for Nigeria\u2019s Misery",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has lambasted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for being the architect of the country\u2019s economic hardship. The government alleged that the mismanagement of national resources by the opposition party at a time the economy was buoyant laid the foundation for the current woes.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the accusation on Monday at a no-holds-barred press briefing in Abuja.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the PDP dismissed the press conference addressed by the minister as another anthology of lies and bogus performance claims \u201cby the failed and rudderless All Progressives Congress (APC) administration.\u201d\n\nMohammed accused the opposition of gloating that Nigerians were suffering under the present administration and indulging in misrepresentation in their desperation to return to power to complete their demolition work on the country.\n\n\u201cBut we say that while they laid the groundwork for today\u2019s suffering with their mismanagement of national resources at a time of plenty, we have introduced unprecedented measures to alleviate the suffering of Nigerians, especially the very vulnerable,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe added, \u201cOur National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) is the biggest of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa. The N-Power benefits one million people; the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) has benefitted four million people; the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) is providing quality meals daily to 10 million primary school pupils, in addition to empowering over 100,000 cooks and the same number of small holder farmers in the local areas where the schools are located; the Household Uplifting Programme (HUP), which has the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) as its flagship intervention, provides N5,000 monthly grants to almost two million eligible households across the country, in addition benefitting from the Conditional Cash Transfers, under the directive of Mr. President to further expand the programme due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d\n\nMohammed criticised PDP, which was in power from 1999 to 2015, for depriving the country of the full benefits of oil windfall at a time of rising oil prices. He said the opposition party neglected the oil industry and for many years, failed to stimulate growth in the oil industry by refusing to put in place the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), until President Muhammadu Buhari signed it into law last year. He said the law was envisaged as a tool to foster investment in the industry and delineate responsibilities to the various institutions.\n\nThe minister flayed the opposition party for going overboard and doing everything in recent times to overheat the polity and distort the achievements of the administration through misinformation about the country\u2019s state of affairs.\n\nHe described PDP as a \u201chungry and desperate opposition\u201d that did want to wait for the 2023 elections to test their popularity or acceptability at the polls.\n\nMohammed stated further, \u201cGentlemen, there is nothing wrong in having a fiery and viable opposition in a democracy. We were there before and we remain the ones to beat in terms of a determined, viable and relentless opposition.\n\n\u201cBut, in our time, not once did we advocate the destruction of Nigeria just because we couldn\u2019t have our way. Not once did we seek to gain power via a desperate court action. If you destroy the country you are seeking to govern, what country will you govern? Must you cut your nose to spite your face?\u201d\n\nMohammed accused PDP of seeking to erase the seven years of unprecedented achievements by the Buhari administration in spite of bringing the country to its kneels in their 16 years of non-performance.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThey said they are ready to rescue Nigeria. Pray, where do kidnappers rescue their victims? These same guys who kidnapped the fortunes of their country are suddenly posing as rescuers. Caveat Emptor. Buyers Beware! Nigerians Beware!\n\n\u201cGentlemen, we are not unmindful of the challenges facing this administration, either in the area of economy, security, power, etc. But we have risen stoutly to the challenges, judiciously utilising the very scarce resources that we have, and we are making an impact. Nigerians are making great sacrifices because they know that today\u2019s difficulties are like the pangs heralding the birth of a new baby.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s pains won\u2019t endure, but the new Nigeria that will emerge will surely do. The people on the other side say infrastructure is not important. In their derisive posturing, they ask: \u2018na infrastructure we go chop?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut they have forgotten the role of infrastructure in economic development via higher productivity and service delivery, job creation and poverty alleviation, just to mention a few. Little wonder they frittered away the resources of the commonwealth instead of using such to develop our infrastructure during their time in the saddle.\u201d\n\nHe lauded the Buhari administration in the areas of security, repair and completion of long abandoned roads and bridges, rehabilitation of railway projects across the country, and delivery of four new state-of-the-art airport terminals in Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt. He added that the government was about to kick-start the construction of the second runway for the Abuja airport.\n\nHe said the only runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja, was left dilapidated until the present administration repaired it.\n\nMohammed noted that through the Police Trust Fund, 200 buffalo branded vehicles, bulletproof vests, protective helmets, drugs, and medical equipment as well as arms and ammunition, riot control equipment, and combat equipment were procured for the Police Special Weapon and Tactical Squad (SWAT).\n\nThe minister said Buhari had approved a 20 per cent review and upgrade of salaries for police personnel, in addition to enhanced duty tour allowance and tax waiver in the sum of N18.6 billion for junior officers to increase their take home pay.\n\nHe accused the opposition of mischief, being clever by half, and misusing statistics by comparing the prices of some foodstuffs, petrol, and diesel, among others, before 2015, with what currently prevailed.\n\n\u201cThis misuse of statistics is clear mischief,\u201d he insisted.\n\nAccording to him, a check on the prices of foodstuffs and petrol in other countries, especially the UK and the US, would show a steep rise, indicating the increase is a global trend and not limited to any country. He said it would be disingenuous to present the price increases as a Nigerian problem.\n\nOpposition Party Replies Minister, Says, Media Briefing Arrogant Stunt to Mislead Nigerians\n\nHowever, PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the press conference addressed by Mohammed was, \u201cAnother desperate and disoriented stunt by the APC administration to divert public attention from the exposed corruption records of the APC national leadership as well as the manifest collapse of security, command and control structure under President Buhari.\u201d\n\nPDP said, \u201cThe APC administration in its arrogance in failure attempted again to downplay and treat with levity, the excruciating economic hardship, hunger and other life discounting experiences being faced by Nigerians daily because of severe food crisis, lingering fuel emergency, high cost of essential commodities and services, closure of schools, insecurity and mass killing, collapse of healthcare system and decayed public infrastructure under its watch.\n\n\u201cIt is the height of impunity and arrogance that the Minister of Information and Culture could address the media to claim that the APC government has achieved food sufficiency, particularly in rice production, when in reality, there is famine in the land with the price of food items, especially rice soaring by over 400 per cent under the APC with its \u2018pyramid of lies\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to PDP, a bag of rice which sold for N7,500 under PDP now sells for over N30,000; a measure of beans, which sold for N350 under PDP now sells for over N1,000; a measure of garri, which sold for N120 under PDP now sells for N700, a bottle of palm oil, which sold for N250 under PDP now sells for over N1000.\n\nPDP pointed out that a kilo of meat, which sold for N700 under its administration, now sold for N3,000; a litre of petrol, which sold for N87 under PDP, was now as high as N400 to N500, while a litre of diesel, which sold for N110 under PDP, now cost over N800.\n\nThe main opposition party slammed Mohammed for provocatively claiming that Nigerians were better off under the APC.\n\nAccording to Ologunagba, Nigerians now know better, \u201cand the question to ask is, Is your life better now in 2022 under the APC than it was in 2015 under the PDP?\u201d\n\nHe said it was ludicrous and insensitive that \u201cthe APC government went to the media to list non-existent roads, bridges, agricultural and health projects as achievements.\n\n\u201cMore pathetic is the APC\u2019s attempt to claim credit for development projects initiated and implemented by successive PDP administrations, including our railways, aviation, agricultural, healthcare, education, telecommunications, banking and manufacturing sectors, among others.\u201d\n\nPDP said it was \u201claughable that the APC government is also claiming credit for critical projects in various parts of the country, which are being funded by resources mobilised by the PDP administrations under the framework of counterpart funding from international partners and bodies.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe only legitimate achievements of the APC government include its corruption record (second most corrupt in West Africa and 154 out of 180 in Global Corruption Index), over 33 per cent unemployment rate, a weakened currency at over N500 to a dollar, N33 trillion foreign debt and still counting, and the siphoning of over N16 trillion by APC leaders.\u201d\n\nPDP cautioned APC to note that \u201cits continued arrogance in failure is daily confronting and reminding Nigerians of the statement made by one of its founding members, the late Prince Tony Momoh in April 2016 and the consequences are better imagined.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",
