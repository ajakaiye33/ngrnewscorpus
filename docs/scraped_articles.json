          "title": "Looming strike: Hold FG responsible, ASUU tells parents",
          "text": "At least two zones of the Academic Staff Union of Universities have asked Nigerians to hold the Federal Government responsible if the body of university lecturers embarks on another strike.\n\nThe Abuja and Bauchi zones of the union said this on Tuesday while accusing the government of not implementing the agreement it signed with the lecturers in December 2020.\n\nIn March 2020, ASUU embarked on a strike as a result of its disagreement with the Federal Government on the funding of universities, the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, implementation of the University Transparency Accountability Solution, funding and revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, promotion arrears and renegotiation of the 2009 agreement.\n\nASUU held several meetings with the Federal Government on the UTAS and the other issues, which were approved by the government, with a promise of prompt implementation.\n\nThe government\u2019s assurance of implementation, which was accompanied by the signing of a Memorandum of Action, led to the calling off of the strike on December 24, 2020, after the Federal Government also agreed to exclude ASUU members from the IPPIS.\n\nHowever, ASUU for some weeks now has been urging the government to fulfil the agreements contained in the Memorandum of Action, which it signed with the union.\n\nAs a result, the Abuja zone of the union, at its congress on Tuesday, accused the Federal Government of reneging on its promises and warned that such an action could lead to a fresh industrial action in the nation\u2019s universities.\n\nThe zone comprises the Federal University of Lafia, Nasarawa State; Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State; Nasarawa State University, Keffi; Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Niger State; and the University of Abuja.\n\nThe union said it could no longer guarantee industrial harmony in public universities due to the attitude of the government to the agreements.\n\nThe zonal coordinator, Dr Salahu Lawal, disclosed this at a press conference in Abuja.\n\nLawal urged Nigerians and parents with children in public universities to hold the government responsible for the consequences that might arise from the non-implementation of the MoA.\n\nHe said, \u201cRecall that our union signed a Memorandum of Action with the government, leading to the suspension of the 2020 strike action in February 2021, but almost nine months on, ASUU is again calling on the government to honour its promises to the Nigerian people on the immediate deployment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution.\n\n\u201cThe government, as it has always done, again reneged on its promises to the union and the nation, a development that can lead to another industrial action in the universities.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, demand the implementation of all outstanding provisions in the February 7, 2021 FGN/ASUU Memorandum of Action; the immediate deployment of ASUU\u2019s innovation of a more robust system of human resources management and compensation called the UTAS; and the immediate payment of outstanding earned academic allowances to our members.\n\n\u201cWe also demand the full implementation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement as renegotiated in 2021 based on the ILO\u2019s collective bargaining principle; immediate action on the report of the presidential visitation panels to federal universities without delay; and immediate action on the recommendations of the committee on state universities.\n\n\u201cWe urge all Nigerians to hold the Federal Government responsible if the union decides to embark on another industrial action following the non-implementation of the MoA.\u201d\n\nLawal added that signing into law the draft renegotiated 2009 agreement and the release of revitalisation funds to public universities would address the deplorable conditions under which students live and learn.\n\nHe stated, \u201cASUU has for long laid bare to both the government and Nigerians the decrepit state of infrastructure on our campuses, which has been the bane of research activities in our universities.\n\n\u201cOur call for urgent intervention in this respect has been acknowledged by the government.\u201d\n\n95 lecturers owed up to 13 months\u2019 salaries \u2013 ASUU, Bauchi zone\n\nOn its part, the Bauchi zone of the union lamented that 95 of its members in three institutions had not been paid their salaries for up to 13 months.\n\nThe Zonal Coordinator, ASUU, Bauchi Zone, Prof Lawan Abubakar, who disclosed this during a press conference at the union\u2019s secretariat in the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, said since they were \u201cforced\u201d into the IPPIS, the affected lecturers had continuously been omitted from the payment of salaries every month.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe inconsistencies observed in the application of the IPPIS in the payment of salaries and remittances of third-party deductions have continued in all the federal universities. Since the introduction of the IPPIS in February 2020, our members have continued to be omitted from the payment of salaries on a monthly basis.\n\n\u201cThis is the situation across all the federal universities in the country. Every month when salary is paid, different sets of staff members will have their names omitted from the payment for that particular month.\n\n\u201cAs we speak now, about 61 lecturers from the University of Jos are being owed salaries for two to 13 months; it is the same situation at the ATBU, Bauchi, which has 16 lecturers; and the Federal University of Kashere with 18 lecturers.\n\n\u201cThis is deliberate and amounts to victimisation of ASUU members by the IPPIS office as a ploy to force them to enrol, thereby frustrating the implementation of the UTAS as agreed before the strike was suspended in 2020.\u201d\n\nHe wondered if some individuals were \u201cfeeding fat\u201d on the high cost of maintenance and consultancy fees on the IPPIS as against the freely developed and more efficient UTAS that had taken care of the universities\u2019 peculiarities and in line with extant laws, adding, \u201cCould this be the reason for the foot-dragging by the Federal Government to deploy the UTAS in the universities?\u201d\n\nAbubakar said another disturbing trend was that professors and readers (associate professors), who were supposed to retire at the age of 70, were being forcefully retired by the IPPIS through the abrupt stoppage of their salaries in violation of the Universities Miscellaneous Act of 2012.\n\nHe noted that the salaries paid to the union members were not commensurate with their ranks based on the prevailing salary table, wondering where the \u201cunauthorised\u201d deductions were going to.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat we have been suffering is a theft of our salaries. At the end of every month, no one can say for certain what his/her exact salary will be as a result of unauthorised deductions; one must just do with what the IPPIS throws at you.\n\n\u201cWhen the UTAS is deployed, we will ask for the running of our salaries from January 2020 to see clearly what we were supposed to get and what we got; then, we will demand that the government pays us the backlog of our salaries it has been deducting. There will be trouble; it is imminent.\u201d\n\nThe zonal coordinator accused the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, and the Accountant-General of the Federation of not being willing to solve the problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either he (Ngige) is not willing to solve these problems or he\u2019s simply incompetent to address them. The AGF has been evading us, because we know he is a problem. We know how they are eating fat on the IPPIS and we know how they have held our various university administrations to ransom on the issue of employment,\u201d he added.\n\nAbubakar accused the Federal Government of \u201conly being interested in provoking another strike because since the suspension of the strike in December 2020, the Federal Government has simply gone to sleep over the implementation of most items agreed upon as contained in the Memorandum of Action.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he thought the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was concerned about solving the issues that ASUU had with the government, he said, \u201cI cannot say if any politician is concerned about Nigeria. They are only concerned about their families.\n\n\u201cWe cannot engage in a dialogue with the government forever. The dialogue with this government is not fruitful. I am sure the government can resolve all the issues in one day, because we have been discussing with it over the years.\u201d\n\nHe said members of ASUU in the Bauchi zone had been stretched beyond their elastic limit and could not continue to wait for the government and its agents displaying all manners of antics, which amounted to delay tactics.\n\nAbubakar added, \u201cOur patience has been taken for granted. We the leaders of this union in the various branches, zones and at the national level cannot continue to manage our members. Our members are not happy with us because they have waited this long with the timelines expiring more than eight months ago and we have not called them back.\n\n\u201cAnytime from now, the union will conclude the process. We have already started the process of going back and when we exhaust our procedures, then, we will announce the date for the strike.\n\n\u201cWe are pained to bring these issues to the public, because more than nine months after suspending the 2020 strike, the government has again reneged on the MoA. The public, in this circumstance, should not hold our union responsible for any disruption of academic activities in Nigerian public universities.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has urged the acting Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Idris Jere, to effectively secure the nation\u2019s borders and ensure nobody slipped in from outside to cause any harm.\n\nThe Media Adviser to the minister, Mr Sola Fasure, who disclosed this in a statement, on Tuesday, in Abuja, quoted the minister as giving the advice when Federal Commissioners and Board Secretary of the NSCDC, Correctional Service, Federal Fire Service and NIS Board (CDCFIB), visited his office to present the Acting C-G to him.\n\nThe media adviser said Aregbesola noted that the primary responsibility of the acting C-G was to lead the service to provide adequate security at the nation\u2019s borders and curtail any attempts by anyone slipping into the country with the intent to cause harm to the country and its citizens.\n\n\u201cIt is important also that you ease the passage of persons that will add value to our country. You will maintain the delicate balance of stopping the bad guys and attracting the good guys\u201d, Aregbesola said.\n\nOn the administration of passport issuance, the minister stated that Nigerians, who were desirous of getting passports must get it expeditiously and without losing their dignity in the process of doing so.\n\n\u201cYou are pretty much aware of the reforms being carried out, foremost of which is in passport administration.\n\n\u201cBeing a passport officer, you will appreciate this challenge more than most.

Whoever was behind such barbarity must be made to pay for their actions.\n\n\u201cWe plead to Biafrans to bear with us for this dastardly act against humanity they are using to disrepute and demomize IPOB in the world. We are calling on the school management and those their properties were destroyed to contact any IPOB office near to them for possible payments of their properties.\n\nEmma Powerful while exonerating its members from the incident at Nkume and Atta has also warned anybody or group who tries to commit crime using its name.\n\nSame vain, Powerful has emphasised that there is no more sit-at-home after Tuesday\u2019s declaration. He also seized the opportunity to reiterate the relax of the order on Mondays till when Nnamdi Kanu would be appearing in court .\n\nHe said \u201cWe the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to reiterate once again, that we have no other sit-at-home order after 14th September.\n\n\u201cAny other purported sit-at-home including the suspended weekly sit-at-home on Mondays does not exist in the dairy of IPOB. In fact, after September 14, there is no other sit-at-home this week. Any contrary news or speculations to this effect should be ignored.\n\n\u201cAnybody trying to enforce any sit-at-home order using the name of IPOB is a saboteur, and does so at his peril. If we catch anybody disturbing the peace of Biafrans or residents in Biafra land under the guise of enforcing non-existent sit-at-home order, such a person regret his actions because he will receive the reward of traitors.\n\nExplaining why the order was relaxed on Mondays ,Powerful said \u201cIPOB is a responsible organisation with reasoning and empathy. We cannot be part of the problem we are trying to solve. We cannot join the enemies to compound the woes of our people we are fighting to liberate.\n\n\u201cThat was why we suspended the ghost Mondays that we earlier declared because of the economic implications to our people. We listened to appeals by the people and reviewed our stance on the matter then. That was why we reduced the sit-at-home protests to the days our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be making appearances in court.\n\n\u201cThat is enough for now and we stand by it. Anybody trying to impose another sit-at-home order on our people or enforce illegal or imaginary sit-at-home is not IPOB, and must be dealt with. Such a person(s) are working with the enemies to disrepute IPOB, and we won\u2019t tolerate such stupidity.\u201d Powerful stated.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "To consolidate on the growth and resilience of Nigerian banks in the last decade, the Central Bank has announced that it will establish the Nigerian International Financial Centre (NIFC) in the next 12 months.\n\nDisclosing this Tuesday in an address to the banking community at the 14th Annual Banking & Finance Conference, organized by the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said the NIFC will act as an international gateway for Capital and investments, driven by technology and payment system infrastructure.\n\nNoting that the new financial hub will curate local and international banks to make them global champions, the CBN governor said the NIFC will be a 24/7 financial centre that will complement London, New York and Singapore financial centers and enable an acceleration of home grown initiatives such as the Infracorp plc, the N15 Trillion infrastructure fund which would be launched in October.\n\nApart from this, Emefiele said the NIFC would also complement initiatives on the Nigerian Commodity exchange and the National Theatre creative hubs for Nigerian youths as well as the E-naira project which will also debut in October.\n\nHe said the NIFC would take advantage of existing laws such as the BOFIA 2020, NEPZA and other CBN regulations to create a fully global investment and financial hub where monies, ideas, and technology will move freely without hindrance.\n\nCommenting on the theme of the conference \u201cRecovery, Inclusion and Transformation: The role of Banking and Finance\u201d, Emefiele said it was apt, given the unprecedented events of 2020, especially when considered along the measures put in place by policy makers to reverse a significant downturn in economic activities in 2020.\n\nRecalling the steps taking to prevent the economic crisis from spilling into a financial crisis, Emefiele said CBN worked to protect the interest of depositors by ensuring that banks made adequate capital provisions to cover for unexpected losses.\n\n\u201cWe also enabled banks to restructure loans granted to individuals and businesses significantly affected by the pandemic. Our banks also demonstrated exceptional resilience by putting in place business continuity plans, along with the deployment of digital channels, which ensured that the provision of financial services to customers was not disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cWe are delighted that these measures have paid off. Indeed, key indicators in the banking sector continue to reflect that our banking sector remains strong, resilient, and healthy. Capital Adequacy Ratio and Liquidity Ratio in the banking sector have remained above the prudential limits at 15.5 and 41.3 percent, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe Non-Performing Loan Ratio of the Banking Industry in July 2021 stood at 5.4 percent reflecting continued improvements from 6 percent in September 2020. Our banking sector remains well positioned to support the recovery efforts of the fiscal and monetary authorities. \u201c\n\nThe CBN governor declared that \u201cNigerian banks have become not only strong and resilient, but have also carved a good niche in the world.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Gen. Faruk Yahaya, yesterday, read the riot act to war commanders in terrorism-ravaged parts of the country, saying he would no longer accept excuses for non-performance in the prosecution of the war against insurgency and armed banditry. Yahaya asked commanders in the various theatres of operation to seize initiative and take decisive actions to defeat threats in their respective areas of responsibility.\n\nThe army chief emphasised, \u201cFailure is failure, irrespective of the circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn his address at the opening ceremony of the Chief of Army Staff Combined Second and Third Quarter Conference 2021, held in Abuja, Yahaya stated that the Nigerian Army on his watch would remain resolute and continue to chart the progressive path towards tackling the security challenges confronting the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have directed that serious attention be given to sustaining and improving the tempo in all on-going Nigerian Army operations across the country. I have also directed the conduct of special operations, especially, in the North-central and North-west regions.\n\n\u201cCommanders must, therefore, glean from my command philosophy to ensure that operational and administrative proficiencies of the Nigerian army units and formations are sustained and improved upon.\n\n\u201cCommanders must seize initiatives and commanders must take initiatives, they must take decisive actions to defeat the threats in their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR).\n\n\u201cI will not again take or accept no excuses. Gentlemen, failure is failure, irrespective of the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe army chief acknowledged that there were logistic constraints affecting operations across the country and disclosed that efforts were in progress to provide combat enablers that would enhance and boost military operations. He also said concerted efforts were being made to eliminate the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which had been a major impediment to troops and Operation Hadin Kai.\n\nYahaya acknowledged the imperative of training and retraining of troops for operational efficiency, and reiterated his determination to rebuild fighting skills, capacity, confidence and morale of troops across the theatres of operations through \u201ctraining and more training\u201d.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff Combined Second and Third Quarter Conference 2021 was the first edition of the conference under Yahaya as army staff.\n\nThe quarterly programme of the Nigerian Army brought together Principal Staff Officers, General Officers Commanding, Commandants of Strategic Army formations, and operational commanders to brainstorm and interact with the Chief of Army Staff on the state of affairs of the Nigerian Army and review its plans for the next quarter.\n\nA major highlight of the opening ceremony of the three-day conference themed, \u201cDeveloping Enduring Strategy to Accomplish Assigned Mission in a Joint Environment,\u201d was the commissioning of seven satellite communication vehicles and conferment of special awards to some distinguished officers.\n\nAmong those given awards was the guest lecturer at the event, Maj Gen Lawrence Ngubane (rtd), who delivered a lecture, titled, \u201cLeadership Development as a Panacea for Accomplishing Mission in a Joint Environment.\u201d\n\nLt Gen Lamidi Adeosun (rtd) and the current Commandant of Nigerian Defence Academy, Maj Gen Ibrahim Manu, were also honoured. Yusuf received the award of Knight of the National Order of Chad conferred on him by the Government of the Republic of Chad for his outstanding performance during his time as Commander of the Multi-national Joint Task Force (MNJTF) headquartered in Ndjamena, Chad Republic.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has confirmed a attack on Peigyim village, near Kibori, Atyap Chiefdom of Zangon Kataf Local Government Area, and said 12 people were killed by gunmen.\n\nA statement on Monday by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the gunmen stormed the village late on Sunday evening.

          "text": "South Africa-based Jumo has partnered with MANSA Bank and MTN Mobile Financial Services to provide loans to entrepreneurs and small businesses in Ivory Coast.\n\nFounded in 2015 and backed by Goldman Sachs, Jumo offers savings and credit products to entrepreneurs in emerging markets, as well as financial services infrastructure to partners such as e-money operators and banks.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, which is Jumo\u2019s most recent market, the collaboration will see the company introduce its new short-term and small-scale loan product, VitKash, built in partnership with MANSA and offered through MTN\u2019s mobile money platform.\n\nAccording to a press statement from Jumo, VitKash will be available to micro-entrepreneurs who have lacked access to finance and are looking to develop a positive credit record through responsible loan management.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs in the informal sector contribute an average of 60% to the GDP of West African countries, yet less than 15% of them have access to banks as a source of financing,\u201d Jumo\u2019s Country Manager for Ivory Coast, Bemah Kone, said. \u201cThe roll-out of innovative fintech products like VitKash in the region serves to address this issue.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nJumo is mainly focused on Africa and Asia and is currently active in seven markets including Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Pakistan, and Ivory Coast. According to Crunchbase, the startup has so far raised $156.7 million in funding.\n\nIn over five years of operation, Jumo claims to have enabled the disbursement of more than $3 billion in loans and reached over 18 million customers and small businesses. It has a client base that includes Uber, Barclays Bank, Ecobank, Tigo, Airtel, and now MTN and MANSA Bank.\n\n\u201cJumo is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for large banks to deploy capital to new market segments,\u201d said Buhle Goslar, Jumo\u2019s Africa CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about bringing our proven business model to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and working with our partners to create positive outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with MANSA and MTN is the first of its kind for Jumo in Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into last year. The recent expansion was driven by a number of factors, which according to Kone make the West African nation an \u201cattractive market\u201d for Jumo.\n\n\u201cIvory Coast has all the characteristics of an attractive market with high growth potential. These include low banking penetration, a large mobile money base, limited access to financing, and high demand for digital lending products,\u201d Kone told TechCabal via email\n\nAccording to the Ivorian telecom regulator, the country\u2019s number of mobile money users rose to 20.8 million as of March 31, 2021, from 13.4 million as of the same time in 2018. The mobile money penetration rate stands at 76.9%.\n\n\u201cIn the WAMU (West African Monetary Union) zone, there is a strong will from the BCEAO (the central bank of 8 Francophone West African States) to improve financial inclusion and financial literacy,\u201d Kone said. \u201cWest and Central Africa is the next frontier for Jumo and the regions are ripe for expansion.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nDigitising informal recycling\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the ASEAN region is one of the highest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt scale, our solution cuts across every developing nation and we\u2019re building in a way that it can be implemented everywhere.\u201d\n\nArewa is also looking to promote a recycling culture among Nigerians, which would significantly increase the amount of waste collected, as the current volume recovered falls short of the demand for recyclables. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not able to meet the demand for recyclables, which is why expanding the collection network and producer sensitisation are extremely important over the next few months.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s population is estimated to double by 2050; that\u2019s most likely to result in more solid waste hanging around and more items for recycling. As Scrapays\u2019 collectors move around streets fulfilling pick-up requests, the startup\u2019s low-tech, high-impact solution is addressing health, poverty, and urban resilience issues in Africa\u2019s largest country, one city at a time.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

Nigerians have been too dependent on crude oil. It is time to look beyond oil and get our hands dirty in the non-oil sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigeria is the third-largest producer of cocoa in Africa and Edo State is among the fifth.

We want to see made-in-Edo products everywhere around the world.\u201d\n\nThe governor encouraged small and medium business owners to take advantage of the Bank of Industry opportunities for funding, adding that the state recently signed a N2bn MSMEs fund with the bank.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cFor us as a government, we want to see businesses in Edo thrive. We want to be able to support businesses in the state. As you know, Edo is becoming a retail hub for supermarkets and super malls: Hallmark, Market Square, JARA stores are all in Edo; many more are coming. The N2bn MSMEs funds recently signed by the state government are to ameliorate the challenge of funding being faced by businesses.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Director, Irabor and Sons Nigeria Limited, Dr. Chris Osazuwa, said the company produced the new beverage as part of the process of contributing to a virile local economy, while appreciating the state government for creating the enabling environment for businesses to operate.\n\n...",

As a state, we are doing everything possible to make sure that people don\u2019t get infected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to our people to get vaccinated because that is the more suitable way to prevent the severity of the disease and avoid death. The enforcement teams will commence tomorrow to help us reduce the number of cases and deaths that we are recording daily,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the Head of COVID-19 Enforcement Team, Mr. Yusuf Haruna, said the government has trained 20 special teams spread across the state to commence the enforcement of \u201cno vaccination, no entry into government-owned facilities.\u201d\n\nHaruna said: \u201cAs we all know, the government has the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of citizens. In view of this, we have trained 20 special teams that will be spread across the 18 local government areas of the state.\n\n\u201cThey will commence this enforcement from the 15th of September, 2021. What we expect our people to do is that, while going to work, they should go with their vaccination cards. The government is not forcing anybody to take the vaccines, but it has the responsibility to tell you not to spread the virus.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhat we are going to do tomorrow is to grant those who have the authentic vaccination cards access to their government working places and those without the cards can go back and work from home.\n\n\u201cThese 20 special teams will be saddled with the responsibility of scanning and confirming the authenticity of these vacation cards and also diligently asking those who don\u2019t have to go and work from home. This is the directive of the state government and it will be enforced to the letter.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "The Chairman of Trademore Estate, Phase 3 Residents Association, Adewale Adenaike, on Tuesday said none of the residents of the estate died as a result of the recent flooding.\n\nThe estate, located off Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua Expressway (formerly Airport Road), witnessed yet another flood between late Sunday night and Monday morning, leading to the death of at least three persons and the destruction of properties worth billions of naira.\n\nAltogether, about 166 houses were affected by the flood, which many of the old residents described as the worst in 12 years.\n\nMr Adenaike told PREMIUM TIMES that all the bodies recovered so far were swept into the estate by the flood.\n\n\u201cAs far as I know today, when the NEMA people came, they confirmed that they had picked up seven bodies all together.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose any residents, all the people who died are not from here. They are visitors. The guy who was in the Rover came to buy things in the estate. So, he is not a member of this estate and the other bodies came with the flash flood, they are not really resident,\u201d he said.\n\nThe residents on Tuesday morning identified one of the dead victims as a top official of the State Security Service (SSS).\n\nThis newspaper could however not verify the information as of the time of filing this report because the agency spokesperson, Peter Ifunanya, did not respond to calls or text messages to his mobile telephone.\n\nJustin Uwazuruonye, Head of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Abuja Operations Office, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES, said only four persons died in the flood incident.\n\nHe said the agency only evacuated one while the other three were located by the families of the victims as the search for more bodies continued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that, officially FEMA and police are aware of four, we (NEMA) are also aware of four,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cWe were the ones that evacuated one from the vehicle. The other three bodies were from the families. We only told them to report officially to the police if somebody is missing or dead somewhere, in case they see any dead body along the drainage system down to those villages.\n\n\u201cAs I speak with you this evening, we don\u2019t have any official information indicating that the number of casualties has risen to seven.\n\n\u201cWe were there today, we are just coming from there. It is today we were able to recover the vehicle of the last body we evacuated yesterday,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Uwazuruonye dismissed speculations that three additional bodies were evacuated from the scenes of the havoc.\n\nAs the search continued, PREMIUM TIMES during a visit to the estate on Tuesday noticed that business activities had picked up despite the ruins in their surroundings occasioned by the flood.\n\nSome of the residents, mostly those that live around Imo Street, one of the most affected parts of the estate, were busy cleaning their properties.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe police station in the estate, which was deserted on Monday as a result of the water level, was open to the public.\n\nAn officer who pleaded anonymity because he was not authorised to speak told PREMIUM TIMES that the station lost quite a number of vital documents.\n\nOfficials from the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), led by its Vice-Chairman, Lawrence Onuchukwu, also visited the scenes of flooding and pledged support for the residents.",

Anybody who wants to waste money should give money to incumbent governors, but when those governors go, nobody will follow the agreement reached. Therefore, our governors are warned. Reluctance or even arrogant refusal to comply with that decision is considered as a coup against the masses of Southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile we commend Enugu and Abia States for their efforts to empanel legislation on anti-open grazing, we urge the other states in the South, especially the South East and other lgbo-speaking states of the South South to put in place, necessary machinery to comply with the southern governors\u2019 resolution or be liable for aborting the popular will and desire of our people.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government spent N11.679 trillion on debt servicing while N8.31trillion was expended on capital/development expenditure between 2015 and 2020, according a report titled \u201cAnalysis of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper,\u201d presented in Abuja yesterday by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ).\n\nA breakdown of the amount showed that in 2015 and 2016, N953.620 billion and N1.475 trillion, respectively, were spent on debt service, while N1.841 trillion and N2.203 trillion went into same line item in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThe sums of N2.254 trillion and N2.951 trillion went into debt service in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe N11.679,845,205, 997 five-year debt service profile (2015-2020) also translated to a yearly average of N1.386 trillion.\n\nAt the presentation, the Lead Director of CSJ, Eze Onyekpere, whose organisation has been in the forefront of the campaign for fiscal discipline and transparency in public affairs, stated that Nigeria\u2019s debt had also been increasing in double digits year-after-year since 2015, with the highest increase recorded between 2015 and 2016.\n\nOnyekpere, citing the Debt Management Office (DMO) statistics, noted that public debt stock stood at N12,603 trillion in 2015, N17.360 trllion in 2016, and N21.725 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, 2019 and 2020, public debt stood at N24.387 trillion, N27.401 trillion, and N32.915 trillion, respectively.\n\nThe highest increase was occurred between 2015 and 2016.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, Nigeria\u2019s public debt increased by 161 per cent, indicating a yearly average increase of 37.74 per cent.\n\nThe CSJ chief executive stated that the debt service figures provided the factual background to the presentation of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF\u2019s) position on consolidated debt.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Consolidated Debt Statement affirms the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) 2020-2023 as the governing policy strategy. The MTEF states that the MTDS focuses on the development of an optimal borrowing structure to fund the government\u2019s financial gap and needs, taking into consideration borrowing options, cost of borrowing and the associated risks with borrowing.\n\n\u201cUnder the MTDS, the proposed portfolio composition is 70 per cent for domestic debt and 30 per cent for external debt while total debt as a ratio of the GDP has been increased from 25 per cent to 40 per cent; average tenure of debt portfolio is a minimum of ten years.\n\n\u201cIt proposed up to five per cent of the GDP in sovereign guarantees for private companies executing public projects and Promissory Notes is to be issued to settle government arrears, Ways and Means Advance at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the debt stock of 5 state owned enterprises (SOEs.\u201d\n\nOnyekpere recalled that the Consolidated Debt Statement setting out and describing the fiscal significance of the debt liability of the federal government was expected to process measures to reduce any such liability.\n\nHowever, he regretted that the MTEF\u2019s proposals were about measures to increase the liability, noting that debt as ratio of GDP increased from 25 per cent to 40 per cent and up to five per cent of GDP in sovereign guarantees for private companies executing projects, among others.\n\nHe said Nigeria would continue borrowing in the medium term to finance expenditure, adding that the borrowing projections in the 2022-2024 MTEF contradicts the provisions of the Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), which sets a portfolio composition of 70 per cent for domestic debt and 30 per cent external debt.\n\nThe trajectory, he noted, was leading to a 50:50 ratio, adding that debt service to revenue would be increasing in the medium term while capital expenditure as a percentage of total federal government spending would be decreasing in the medium term.\n\nSimilarly, he pointed out that from available facts, recurrent expenditure as a percentage of total FGN spending, would be increasing in the medium term.\n\nOnyekpere pointed out that in the FGN Revenue Framework, the share of oil revenue to FGN overall revenue was projected at 43 per cent in 2022, 51 per cent in 2023 and 46 per cent in 2024 while the share of non-oil taxes (VAT, CIT and Customs collection) to FGN overall revenue is projected at 29 per cent in 2022, 28 per cent for 2023 and 34 per cent for 2024.\n\nHe stated that the FGN Expenditure Framework showed that statutory transfers as a percentage of total FGN budget amounted to 4.31 per cent, 5.15 per cent, 5.23 per cent and 4.96 per cent for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\nOnyekpere stated, \u201cDebt service, including Sinking Funds to total FGN budget is 29 per cent, 33 per cent, 39 per cent and 44 per cent respectively for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cRecurrent non-debt expenditure amounts to 48.94 per cent, 52.11 per cent, 47.81 per cent and 44.29 per cent respectively for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cThe high level personnel costs as a component of recurrent non debt expenditure (66.4% in 2021; 68% in 2022; 67.9% in 2023 and 67.9 per cent in 2024) is further evidence of the imperative for reducing the cost of governance.\n\n\u201cSpecial interventions funds amounts to 3.04 per cent, 2.94 per cent, 2.61 per cent and 2.39 per cent respectively for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cCapital expenditure (excluding Government owned Enterprises and statutory transfers) amounts to 32.87 per cent, 23.82 per cent, 20.22 per cent and 18.50 per cent for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively.\u201d\n\nCSJ recommended that MTEFs should be prepared on the strength of high-level overarching national policy instruments, pointing out that a clear successor to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERHP) should be articulated and made available to Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the organisation, there are references in the MTEF to a Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), which is neither in the public domain nor a product of the popular participation by Nigerians.",

          "text": "President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, on Monday gave some startling insight into the salary structure prevailing in the Nigerian judiciary.\n\nShe said the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), who is the head of the judiciary in Nigeria, as at today takes home N279, 497 as monthly salary, an equivalent of $680.\n\nOther justices on the Supreme Court bench go home with the sum of N206,425 or $502.\n\nShe said as President of the Court of Appeal, she receives the sum of N206,425 or $502.\n\nOther justices on the bench of the Court of Appeal, go home with N166,285 or $404 every month.\n\nDongban-Mensem said the salaries, minus allowances, of judicial officers have stagnated for over 10 years.\n\nDongban-Mensem was right that the salaries have stagnated for years.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t get right the years of stagnation.\n\nAlso, she didn\u2019t reflect the entire truth about the salaries of the judges.\n\nThe last time salaries of judicial and political office holders was reviewed was in 2008.\n\nThat is a clear 13 years, three years more than the estimate by Dongban-Mensem.\n\nAlso, she only provided the basic salaries of the judicial officers, which, in any way are scandalous in an economy ravaged by inflation and exchange rate 300 percent more than it was at the time of the last review.\n\nAs published by the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission(RMAFC), the CJN takes home N560,662, about $1,000 at the unofficial exchange rate.\n\nWhile his basic pay is N280,331.04, he also earns N70, 082 as personal assistant allowance, N140,165 as hardship allowance and N70,082 as dressing allowance.\n\nFor a country that references itself as the biggest economy in Africa, it is sheer absurdity for the CJN to earn $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year, when his South African counterpart earns R 2.9million or $196,000 a year.\n\nAlso the salary of other justices in the Supreme Court and the President of the Court of Appeal is much higher than the N206,425 which Justice Monica claimed.\n\nThe N206,425 is the monthly basic pay.\n\nThe take home pay for this category of judicial officers is N486,765.95.\n\nLike the CJN, they also earn allowances such as N70,082 for personal assistant, N140,165.52 as hardship allowance and N70,082 as dressing allowance.\n\nThe table published by RMAFC, shown below is inaccurate. P.M.News recalculated by finding the true monthly value of yearly basic of N2,477,110 for these officers.\n\nHowever, other judicial officers like judges of Court of Appeal, FCT chief judge, President National Industrial Court take home more money than the CJN or President Court of Appeal.\n\nThey earn a total of N731,657.65 monthly, on the back of many allowances. Under government policy, they have to pay for their own accommodation, pay for domestic aides and service their vehicles themselves.\n\nThe government picks the provides official accommodation and vehicles for the senior judicial officers and monetises such perks for other officers.(See table:\n\nJustice Monica Dongban-Mensem may have been economical with the truth about the actual take-home pay of judicial officers, she may have done other public officers a lot of good.\n\nThe salary level for Nigerian officials from the President downwards really calls for urgent review.\n\nBut the question will be whether the government can afford a holistic review in view of the meagre resources of government.\n\nAs per the 2008 RMAFC document, the President of Nigeria earns N1,171,568.20 a month. His basic salary is N292,892.08, just about N12,000 more than the CJN\u2019s salary.\n\nThe Vice President earns a basic pay of N252,631.04 and a total pay of N1,010,524.\n\nMinisters, head of service, Secretary to the Government of the Federation and chairman of RMAFC and other constitutional bodies earn N650,136.\n\nFor other public officers, please read here: Remuneration-Package-for-Political-and-Judicial-Office-Holders-\n\nOne of the falls out of Dongban-Mensem\u2019s intervention is the need to have a second look at the out-of-station allowances for public officers.\n\nUnless public officials travel, when they could earn between $2,000 to $600 a day, they collect far less when they travel within Nigeria.\n\nThe CJN is only entitled to N50,000 outside of Abuja and the President Court of Appeal, N30,000. With this kind of allowance, they can only spend the night in two star or three star hotels.\n\nWith the powerful voice of Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, it may not be long when the RMAFC will do a comprehensive review of the remuneration of not only judicial officers, but also all public office holders.",
          "summary": "Dongban-Mensem said the salaries, minus allowances, of judicial officers have stagnated for over 10 years.\nWhile his basic pay is N280,331.04, he also earns N70, 082 as personal assistant allowance, N140,165 as hardship allowance and N70,082 as dressing allowance.\nThe government picks the provides official accommodation and vehicles for the senior judicial officers and monetises such perks for other officers.\nHis basic salary is N292,892.08, just about N12,000 more than the CJN\u2019s salary.\nThe CJN is only entitled to N50,000 outside of Abuja and the President Court of Appeal, N30,000.",

          "text": "A former governor of Nasarawa state and serving federal lawmaker, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has faulted northern governors planning to ban open grazing in their states.\n\nSenator Adamu who kicked against the move in its entirety, also said movement of herders with their cattle is constitutional while describing anti-open grazing law as unconstitutional.\n\nHe also declared that contrary to yearnings in some parts of the country for a possible southern presidency in 2023, the 1999 Constitution does not make provision for rotational presidency.\n\nThe lawmaker made the positions known while fielding questions from the Senate Press Corps Monday in Abuja.\n\nThe southern governors, had, at the end of their meeting in Asaba, agreed to enact anti-open grazing laws in the region to curb incessant clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nAs at the time of this report, Ondo state Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and his Enugu counterpart, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi had signed the anti-open grazing law, making open grazing an offence in their states.\n\nEl-Rufai, Masari, Ortom on open grazing\n\nAlthough the former governor was not specific on any northern governor, but Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai and his Katsina counterpart, had at different times faulted the open grazing by cattle herders.\n\nAlso, Benue state Governor David Ortom has signed into law the ban on open grazing amidst criticisms from certain quarters.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the year during a visit to Yola, Adamawa state, Governor El-Rufai had said:\u201cI am a Fulani man. Today, I\u2019m the governor of Kaduna State because I went to school. My parents were settled in one place breeding their livestock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ranching system has so many advantages. For one, it enables children of herders to go to school and have access to quality education like any other Nigerian,\u201d El-Rufai added, even as he said the northern states would need the federal government\u2019s support to get ranching in place.\n\nSimilarly, while featuring on Channels Television last week, Governor Masari had hinted on the state government\u2019s tacit support for non-open grazing method.\n\n\u201cWe intend to have a law banning (cattle) roaming but before we do that, we would make provisions for where the animals would stay,\u201d the governor said during the programme.\n\n\u201cHerdsmen should stay in one place. Roaming about should not be encouraged. In fact, for us, it is un-Islamic. Why do you have animals that you cannot feed and you have to go to other people\u2019s land and farm and you say that is right? I don\u2019t think it is right,\u201d the governor had said.\n\nMasari added: \u201cWe already have started. The federal government has given us N6.2 billion and as a state government, we are also investing N6.2 billion. The objective is to have Fulanis stay in one place.\u201d\n\nAdamu kicks\n\nBut fielding questions from journalists Monday in Abuja, Adamu said in as much as it\u2019s wrong for any herder to use his cattle to destroy the farms, it is unconstitutionally for anybody to restrict his movement or criminalise cattle rearing business going by provisions of free movement and legitimate business in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe fact that a governor or two is doing that doesn\u2019t take away the right of herders. Nature abhors vacuum. The duty to protect the right of farmers rests squarely with the governors.\n\n\u201cThe question to ask is that have the governors done the right thing. The answer is no. The stance of some Northern Governors doesn\u2019t change my position against the law which, as far as the provisions of the 1999 Constitution are concerned, is nullity.\n\n\u201cIf you can protect a spare parts dealer, why can\u2019t you protect a herder? If government can save private banks with public money, why can\u2019t we do that with herders? I am for modernisation but the government must address the problem genuinely.\u201d\n\nOn 2023 election\n\nSpeaking on the 2023 presidential election, the former governor said those nursing the idea of zoning or rotational presidency should jettison it since it is not provided for by the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo part of Nigerian constitution provides for zoning or rotation of political offices , meaning that for anybody to become President , he or she must be ready to go through the ballot box .\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just wish away a position that is fundamental to the life of a country. You can\u2019t talk of merit and talk of zoning. The issue of rotation, let\u2019s just go by merit. Let every party find a way of selling itself in a manner as to garner the kind of votes to deliver the presidential result. It is as simple as that.\n\n\u201cWhat we are practicing is democracy which is government of the people, by the people and for the people. It therefore amounts to wishful thinking for anybody to be thinking of zoning to get to office.\u201d",

          "text": "Ministry of Women Affairs has organised a Validation Workshop on National Communication Strategy on ending all forms of violence and harmful practice against women and girls in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking during the event held at Stone Edge Hotel, in Abuja on 14 September 2021 the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen OFR stated the overall objective of the strategy was to strengthen government-wide approaches, identify, coordinate, integrate, and leverage on the current efforts and resources to address gender-based violence in a holistic, efficient and effective manner.\n\nTallen said that the validation meeting would also serves as a call to action for all Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies including other critical stakeholders to strengthen their collective resolve to prevent and respond effectively to issues of sexual gender-based violence, violence against women and girls and other forms of violence in our society.\n\nShe noted that this would set forth concrete goals and actions to be implemented with monitoring and evaluation mechanisms put in place over the next three years.\n\n\u201cPermit me to say that preventing and responding to Violence against Women and Girls is a cornerstone of the Government\u2019s commitment to advancing women\u2019s fundamental human rights. Also promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls serves and catalyst to addressing problem of gender inequality patriarchy and gender stereo-typing,\u201d Tallen said.\n\nShe lamented that the scale of sexual gender based violence against women and girls and discrimination was alarming the spike pattern trends, and the consequences of these forms of violence impact negatively on individuals, families, communities and country in general.\n\n\u201cViolence against women and girls gender inequality patriarchy and harmful cultural practices significantly inhibits women\u2019s potentials to fully contribute their quota and participate in rational development.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the effects of gender based violence and women and girls affect the entire communities\u2019 women and girls, men and boys differently. No one and no place is immune to this. That is why all hands must be on deck to support families and communities to respond adequately to gender based violence by raising awareness and sensitization, prioritizing access to health services and violence against information, and changing negative norms and harmful beliefs about gender roles that reinforces the ugly practice. You cannot have a conversation about human rights on human dignity without talking about the right of every woman to be free from violence and free from fear When women succeed, Nigeria is more safe, more secure, and more prosperous Over the years, we have witnessed women and girls inspiring communities and entire country to stand up for freedom and justice, thus, I am proud of Federal Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs and her partner\u2019s efforts to promote gender equality in Nigeria. The Ministry has long championed efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, including in the context of child early, and forced marriage, female genital mutilation/cutting, sexual violence, women peace and security, human trafficking, unpaid care work, widowhood rights and the rights of other vulnerable groups in Nigeria. In addition, through my aggressive and continuous advocacy to States Governors, States First Ladies, traditional/religious leaders, Gate Keepers and other critical stakeholders on the implementation of violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, VAPP, 2015 and Child Rights Act, CRA, 2003, I am proud and to state that about 25 States have so far domesticated the VAPP Act in the States,\u201d she added.\n\nShe further stated that 27 States had domesticated CRA and sustained efforts were ongoing to ensure that other States yet to domesticate the two Acts follow suit adding that the Federal Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs was looking forward to collaborate and work with critical stakeholders and other spirited organizations on the implementation of the strategy which was intended to be a broad framework encompassing all forms of gender-based violence across Nigeria.\n\nThe Women Affairs minister also commended the partnership of the EU-Spotlight Initiative and UNFPA, in sponsoring the production of this very important document and this event while calling on them to ensure they play their key role towards ensuring all these negative vices were eradicated and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nTallen appreciated all our stakeholders partners and my amiable staff who worked assiduously in various capacities towards ensuring the successful hosting of this event.",

          "text": "Bayern Munich gave Barcelona a brutal demonstration of how far the Catalan club has fallen by strolling to a 3-0 win in the Champions League on Tuesday, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice in a rout at Camp Nou.\n\nWithout Lionel Messi for a first European campaign since 2003, Barca were outplayed by Bayern, who might have scored more but in the end, settled for three thanks to Thomas Mueller\u2019s deflected opener and Lewandowski\u2019s double.\n\nWhen Lewandowski made it two before the hour, the possibility of another humiliation in the mould of last year\u2019s 8-2 defeat by the same opponents in Lisbon felt very real.\n\nInstead, Bayern delivered perhaps an even louder message about the gulf in class by easing off in the latter stages, as Barca\u2019s fans expressed their anger, dismay, and finally a sense of resignation.\n\nSergi Roberto was on the end of the loudest whistles from the home supporters and it was impossible not to wonder if the criticism came in part from disappointment at the lack of progress down the right flank, where Messi once created so much.\n\nRonald Koeman\u2019s position has come under scrutiny in recent weeks and his 5-3-2 formation, which defies Barcelona\u2019s attacking traditions, will not have strengthened his hand.\n\nYet the bottom line here was the lack of quality in the Barcelona line-up, coming after their turbulent summer of sales, which was inferior to Bayern\u2019s in every department.\n\nMueller has scored seven goals in six appearances now against the Catalans while Lewandowski has scored in 18 consecutive matches.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann\u2019s strong start as the coach continues \u2013 this was a sixth consecutive victory \u2013 but he will know Bayern will face tougher Champions League opposition than this.\n\nIn true underdog fashion, Barca flew into Bayern early on, eager to impress themselves physically on an opponent they perhaps knew would be technically superior.\n\nThe crowd were in on it too, cheering as Luuk de Jong outmuscled Alphonso Davies and Sergi Roberto held off Dayot Upamecano.\n\nThere was then a hint of a chance when Memphis Depay slid De Jong but he lacked the speed to capitalise and Benjamin Pavard cleared.\n\nThe early enthusiasm could only sustain Barcelona so long and as the game settled, gradually Bayern took control.\n\nLeroy Sane volleyed at Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Gerard Pique had to make a last-ditch challenge to stop Mueller.\n\nBut Bayern\u2019s authority was set, even if their opening goal owed a lot to fortune, Mueller unleashing from 30 yards and the ball diverting off the back of Eric Garcia, wrongfooting Ter Stegen and creeping inside the post.\n\nBarca wilted before half-time, the atmosphere turning sour as passes went astray and attacks broke down.\n\nA renewed push after half-time saw Sergio Busquets drive wide but Bayern came again.\n\nSane hit the right foot of Ter Stegen from eight yards and then Lewandowski made it two, studding the ball into an open goal after the Barca keeper committed to Jamal Musiala\u2019s shot that cannoned off the post.\n\nUnder threat of another thrashing, Koeman took off Sergi Roberto and Busquets, to a chorus of whistles from the home fans. The 18-year-old Yusuf Demir and a 17-year-old Gavi came on.\n\nYet Bayern spared Barca a humiliation, waltzing through for one more late on as Lewandowski danced through a sprawl of bodies and fired with five minutes left. For Barca, three felt like a relief.",

          "text": "The banking and finance sector has over the years played significant roles in the economy, but emerging challenges require that the sector takes on more transformative projects such as housing and renewable energy, among others, in ways that significantly impact job creation and poverty reduction, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this today in Abuja at the opening session of the 14th Annual Banking and Finance Conference themed \u201cEconomic Recovery, Inclusion, and Transformation, the role of Banking and Finance\u201d. President Muhammadu Buhari had earlier declared the conference opened and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame also delivered the keynote address.\n\nIn their separate remarks, Presidents Buhari and Kagame commended leaders in Nigeria\u2019s banking and finance sector for their contributions to the development of Africa\u2019s economy. President Buhari specifically urged the sector to support his administration\u2019s efforts in job creation and poverty alleviation, listing some of government\u2019s achievements in the areas.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, \u201cit is time for the sector to take on some of the transformative big-ticket items that would fundamentally transform our economy. Such matters include consumer finance but housing finance in particular.\u201d\n\nHe noted that a focus on how to finance housing is critical.\n\nReferencing an African Development Bank (AfDB) survey, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cthe housing sector may support poverty reduction and inclusive growth in two general ways. First, housing construction contributes to economic output, creates employment, and generates a demand for materials and related services. Second, improved housing raises the standard of living of occupants.\n\n\u201cThat study (AfDB survey) says for example that the benefits of housing for individuals accrue in large part through better health and sanitation, and of course this improves the overall human capacity of our citizens who are able to own these houses. Housing also generates large multiplier effects in terms of employment and output. Employment is created for both skilled and poorer, unskilled workers.\n\n\u201cThe evidence also suggests that there is a symbiotic relationship between housing finance and financial sector development. Housing finance helps to develop the financial sector itself and helps to contribute to economic growth. So, these were the justifications that we also advanced for our mass housing initiative in the Economic Sustainability Plan.\u201d\n\nChallenging the banking sector on participating in the Federal Government\u2019s Mass Housing programme, the VP noted that \u201cthe finance sector appears shy or simply has not found the right housing finance model that will work.\u201d\n\nOn renewable energy and mitigating the impact of climate change, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cone of the chief considerations especially for developing countries is how to pay for the massive transition to renewable energy. How do we pay for moving from where we are especially fossil fuel-based power sources to renewable energy? This is a significant challenge but it is also an enormous opportunity.\u201d\n\nCiting the example of the Federal Government\u2019s solar power initiative, Prof. Osinbajo decried the low interest shown by Commercial Banks to catalyze installations or manufacturing for Solar Power Naija programme.\n\nHe explained that \u201cthe challenge of under-electrification of the rural and poor and it\u2019s associated impacts on our economic well-being and security cannot be overstated. The climate change challenge is a massive one in more ways than we can imagine.\n\nWhile commending the sector for its efforts in improving service delivery over the years, the VP noted that \u201cgoing forward, the banking and finance sector must take advantage of the new opportunities that are opening up and also adapt to domestic and international developments.\n\nProf. Osinbajo also suggested that financial inclusion being critical to the objectives of recovery, inclusion and transformation, should be prioritized \u201cespecially in this COVID era, for the poor and more vulnerable sections of society so that they can keep their micro-businesses alive and handle risks and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nOther dignitaries who spoke at the event include Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, and President of the Chartered Institute of Bankers (CIBN), Mr. Bayo Olugbemi, among other bank executives across the country with several participants also joining virtually.",

          "text": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited has led investments worth more than $300 million into Chinese autonomous driving start-up called DeepRoute.ai\n\nDeepRoute.ai makes self-driving systems for vehicles that involve hardware and software.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based start-up also runs a fleet of autonomous taxis with some operated by its partners including ride-hailing firm CaoCao and automaker Dongfeng Motors. But the company is also developing technology for logistics.\n\nThe Chinese multinational technology giant which specializes in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology, invested to get a foothold in the area of driverless cars.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s involvement in the funding round underscores the ambitions of China\u2019s technology giants to get a foothold in the area of driverless cars. Alibaba is already an investor in another Chinese autonomous driving car start-up called AutoX and is backing electric vehicle maker Xpeng.\n\nAlibaba also has its own logistics arm called Cainiao which plans to develop self-driving trucks.\n\nAccording to the CEO of DeepRoute.ai, Maxwell Zhou, \u201cmost of the money is being spent to develop the technology and the rest is scale up the fleet size\u201d of its robotaxis. Money will also go toward hiring more talent\u201d.\n\nZhou added that the company currently operates around 70 robotaxis and wants to expand its fleet to between 150 to 160. Half of the robotaxis will be operated by DeepRoute.ai, while the other half will be run by its partners.\n\nIn a press release, the company said its long-term strategy includes developing medium-duty trucks for urban logistics, improving transit for shipments as well as freight delivery.\n\nZhou declined to comment on any specific projects with Alibaba, but said \u201cevery opportunity is possible.\u201d\n\nThere are a few sources of revenue for DeepRoute.ai. It can charge passengers for its robotaxi service or revenue share with a ride-hailing firm. Or it can also sell its autonomous driving system to automakers in return for a one-time fee as well as an annual service fee.\n\nIn the logistics space, DeepRoute.ai could run an autonomous driving fleet for a company or again, sell its driverless technology.\n\nChina\u2019s autonomous driving industry is getting very competitive.",

          "text": "South Korea\u2019s competition regulator has vowed to fine Google the U.S. tech giant, $176.9 million (207.4b Korean won) for allegedly using its dominant market position in the mobile operating system space to stifle competition.\n\nThe announcement which was made on Tuesday by the antitrust regulator or Korea Fair Trade Commission, allegedly stated that Google used its market position to block smartphone makers like Samsung from using operating systems developed by rivals.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Android operating system which currently holds the lion\u2019s share of the smartphone market, ahead of Apple\u2019s iOS platform, was also allegedly practice stifled innovation in the development of new operating systems for smartphones, according to Yonhap News.\n\nYonhap News added that the regulator, which published its decision in Korean, said the tech giant required smartphone makers to agree to an \u201canti-fragmentation agreement (AFA)\u201d when signing key contracts with Google over app store licenses and early access to the operating system.\n\nThat agreement prevented device makers from installing modified versions of the Android operating system, known as \u201cAndroid forks,\u201d on their handsets, Yonhap reported.\n\nThe news site added, The KFTC has asked the tech giant to stop forcing companies to sign AFAs and ordered it to take corrective steps, according to Yonhap.\n\nA Google spokesperson argued that Android\u2019s compatibility program has spurred hardware and software innovation, and brought success to Korean phone makers and developers.\n\n\u201cThe KFTC\u2019s decision released today ignores these benefits, and will undermine the advantages enjoyed by consumers. Google intends to appeal the KFTC\u2019s decision,\u201d the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.\n\nTuesday\u2019s fine is small compared with the tech giant\u2019s quarterly figures. Last quarter, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet reported $61.88 billion in revenue.\n\nStill, Tuesday\u2019s decision is the latest setback for the tech company in South Korea.\n\nIn late August, the country\u2019s parliament approved a bill that will allow app developers to avoid paying hefty commissions to major app store operators, including Google, by directing users to pay via alternate platforms.",
