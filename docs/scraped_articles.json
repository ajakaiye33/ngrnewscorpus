          "text": "The leadership of the House of Representatives on Monday grilled the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, over an order to Nigerian embassies, High Commissions and other foreign missions not to implement a clause in the 2022 Appropriation Act that allows them to spend their revenue on capital projects.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, chaired the closed-door meeting where the minister was grilled.\n\nGbajabiamila had invited the minister over an order by the ministry to Nigerian foreign missions not to implement the clause and revert to the headquarters for funding.\n\nA member of the House, Kasimu Maigari, had moved a motion of urgent public importance to raise the alarm, urging the chamber to ensure that the ministry complies with provisions of the Act.\n\nThe House unanimously adopted the motion, directing the ministry to \u201cexpressly comply with the provision of Section 11 of the 2022 Appropriations Act (Power of Nigerian Embassies and Missions) and report such compliance to the House within one week.\u201d\n\nBefore the meeting went into a closed-door session, Gbajabiamila stated that the Appropriation Act is a law that must be obeyed.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe did not just wake up one day and pull something out of the hat and say we want to put this clause. For every law, there is a reason for it. And the reason for it is very simple: I have been all over the world for one official duty or the other, and, of course, the first port of call is always the embassy.\n\n\u201cHonestly, unless we want to kid ourselves; it makes you very un-proud to be a Nigerian\u2026 The state of affairs of where these people are; what they are doing, their lifestyle. What it leads to\u2026Sometimes even to corruption and you cannot even blame them.\n\n\u201cEven within Africa or outside of Africa, we call people ambassadors and I think the meaning of ambassador is very clear. They are a reflection of Nigeria. But when an ambassador does not have a car or his car is 15 years old and it breaks down every single time on the road \u2013 the car has even broken down with me in it before and they had to hurriedly roll up the Nigerian flag and put it in their pockets to avoid embarrassment.\n\n\u201cYou go to an embassy, the toilet is not working. You ask them why, they say there is no money. You go into an embassy; the air conditioners have packed up. I can go on and on. That is what got us here. I cannot begin to tell you what I have seen and what I have heard.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila noted that it was the conditions of the foreign missions that made the lawmakers \u201cinsert a clause that would allow these people remove the red tape; remove the bureaucratic red tape and allow these people to do what they need to do.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf anyone is found wanting, the law is there. Anyone that breaches the law would face the penalty. But we cannot in the name of saying they would breach the law allow Nigeria and Nigerians to suffer.\n\n\u201cYou hear of people withholding the green passport or visas because they are trying to generate money; taking bribes to give people visas and passports because they are trying to generate money, because money is not forthcoming from their home country. There is no point in us appropriating money and the money is not used.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Onyeama said, \u201cI think at the end of the day, what I can say is that from the executive side and the legislative side, we are all essentially here to promote the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians. That is our guiding principle and philosophy and that is what we would do to the best of our ability.\n\n\u201cThank you for convening this meeting. Hopefully, it would be something that would enable us and all of the country to move forward in the best interest of our citizens.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2013Says Nigeria has passed through military rule\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2014PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari last night in Abuja pledged his commitment to hand over a strong repositioned agriculture-led, diversified home-grown economy, stable democracy and revamped armed and security forces to the next Administration.\n\nSpeaking at a dinner in honour of the 2022 Committee of Business, Political, Media and Civil Society Leaders, the President said he was looking forward to completing his tenure in 2023, leaving a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria with 24 years of uninterrupted democracy.\n\nAssuring Nigerians that his administration will finish strong in the last lap of his tenure, the President said:\n\n\u201dA statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and publicity quoted Buhari as saying, \u201cI am gradually entering my final year in office. It is a period I intend to spend not only on consolidating on the achievements of the past seven years but also to leave a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201dI take this initiative to mean that you all intend to collaborate with this administration in that direction.\n\n\u201dFor those among you who are politicians, you must look beyond gaining power to how you can leverage public positions in the process of societal change. To the businessmen and women among you, there is great glory in public service.\n\n\u201dThe question that should be uppermost always is: How do we leverage our business endowment for the greater good of our country?\n\n\u201dI am delighted that members of the Nigerian elite have woken up to the fact that the task of changing this society is a task for all of us, whether we are in the private or public sector. Knowing that, we have enormous challenges as a nation, but they are not beyond our capacity to overcome if we embrace a new approach.\n\n\u201dWe cannot retreat to our ethnic cocoons, nor can we continue to seek solace in our past. We must champion the idea of a Nigeria where every citizen would be proud to call their own. That is the charge before you.\u201d\n\nExpressing delight on the new consciousness by the Nigerian elites to work together with the political class and civil society to build a better Nigeria, President Buhari noted that building consensus around issues of the economy, national security, governance, and such other critical areas of national life is a sure path to the future we seek to build.\n\n\u201dAs we all know, I have been very critical of the Nigerian elites, essentially because some of us have not always demonstrated that we can rise above personal gain, political partisanship as well as ethnic and religious differences when the situation demands that we all speak and or act as one in the interest of our country.\n\n\u201dThere are also many among our elites for whom profit remains the only motivation for any and every enterprise.\n\n\u201dBut now, I feel heartened that a more collaborative social enterprise model for resolving our common challenges is being forged.\n\n\u201dI must commend this initiative and its conveners. This is the kind of spirit I have always advocated because it is what we need at this time as we seek to build our society for peace, security and prosperity through dialogue while narrowing the gap between rich and poor.\u201d\n\nOn the activities of the Committee, the President acknowledged that he was aware that attendance at their inaugural meeting on Sunday cut across a broad section of the society in the public, private sectors, civil society, and the youth.\n\nThe President lauded the group for rising above all ethnic and religious divides for the common good, describing the feat as \u2018\u2018fantastic\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe President, who said he had wished the group had convened earlier, advised them to try and accommodate a few more interests in their next meeting as they take a \u201ddeeper dive into our national challenges and proffer workable and sustainable solutions for the near, medium, and long term.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt is our desire to finish strong in the next 16 months and ensure all hands are on deck for the last lap. We are doubling our efforts against all forms of insecurity, equipping our armed forces and strengthening the police.\n\n\u201dWe are determined to continue the war against corruption and fight poverty, we remain focused on building an all-inclusive economic opportunity for all citizens. \u201d\n\nThe President told the meeting that despite the enormous problems inherited when he assumed office almost seven years ago, he can look back with satisfaction that this administration has kept faith with the people and has done well even amid dwindling resources for reasons that are well beyond our control.\n\n\u201dBut we probably would have fared even better if we secured the support of most of you that are here today, know that while government comes and goes, the country must remain and thrive.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari used the occasion to wish politicians, at the dinner, interested in elective positions in the 2023 polls the best, advising that \u201dthere is nothing better than experience in leadership.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns raised by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on the resurgence of military takeovers in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso in August 2020, September 2021 and January 2022, respectively, the President said he strongly believes that \u2018\u2018Nigeria has passed through that stage for good.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the political situation in some West African countries, Fayemi said:\n\n\u201dWe believe Nigeria has a manifest destiny to protect democracy not just in Nigeria but also in our region. But in doing that we must ensure that our politicians adhere strictly to constitutional principles and I am happy that our President\u2019s position on leaders seeking third term is well known.\u201d\n\nGiving further insight on the workings of the Committee, Governor Fayemi said Nigerians who have benefitted from the country in good time, serving in different capacities, have a duty to support the country.\n\n\u201cWhat the Committee has tried to do is to develop an elite consensus on security and economy, \u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Committee would take advantage of the President\u2019s consistent leadership, relentless passion and patriotism to ensure a seamless transition, while ensuring that the achievements of this administration are sustained and followed through for the benefit of the country.\n\n\u201cHere we have PDP and APC chieftains and we hope by the time we finish this work, what we will present to the President is void of partisan colorations. It is from people who want Nigerians to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe Convener of the Group and Chairman of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena said with Nigeria facing a \u201dhistoric transition like no other\u201d, and with crisis across Africa and at home, the 2022 Committee emerged to \u201ddefend the national interest.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe 2022 Committee was put together to defend Nigeria in a time of crisis and in a time of transition, we must defend the national interest,\u2019\u2019 he said, noting that membership of the group has been carefully selected from the business community, investors, governors, security sector and elder statesmen.",

About 173 of the Chibok girls are still missing. Earlier this month, an unconfirmed number of children were reportedly abducted in Pemi, another community in the Chibok LGA.\n\n\u201cUNICEF is very relieved for the released girls and their families,\u2019\u2019 said Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Representative in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAfter their harrowing experience, it is good news that the girls are back with their families and friends, where they belong. But sadly, dozens of children in north-east Nigeria remain in captivity; the victims of an armed conflict they have nothing to do with. This is unconscionable. Children have the right to a safe environment, health, education and freedom from abuse and torture \u2013 all of which remain compromised when they are in captivity.\n\n\u201cChildren are not the spoils of conflict. All children in captivity must be immediately and safely released to their families.\u201d\n\nChildren in Nigeria continue to face unprecedented violations of their rights, including abductions, torture, killings, recruitment into armed groups, and forced marriages, among other abuses of their rights. In the north-east, more than 1,000 children have been abducted since 2014, with at least 100 still missing or unaccounted for.\n\nBetween December and July of last year, at least 1,450 children were abducted, most from their schools, across central and north-west regions of the country",

What we are looking at is a situation whereby every Nigerian, who is eligible to vote and who is willing to vote will have an opportunity of exercising his franchise\u201d.\n\nHe admitted that, \u201cWe have substantial issues of banditry in some states of the Federation, we have issues of kidnapping and we have secessionists\u2019 agitation and so on.\n\n\u201cOur hope and our prayer is that the various security agencies would neutralize some of these security threats or degrade them substantially so as to enable the people to have confidence that they would go out and vote in a peaceful atmosphere\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking at a situation where the political leaders at different levels, both at the Federal , state and local government levels would engage all the agitating groups, would engage all the groups that can be engaged to make sure that nothing disrupts the 2023 General elections\u201d\n\nHe was optimistic that the country would witness sufficient peace and calmness to conduct the general elections even as he assured that INEC would engage all the critical stakeholders to ensure that there is sufficient confidence to encourage Nigerians to go out and vote in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe also observed that under the Electoral Act, there is a provision that has mandated the Commission to make provisions for people who have been displaced from their natural habitats and settings to vote during the elections adding that these Nigerians would certainly exercise their mandate.\n\nHe however expressed grave displeasure over the failure of political parties to adhere to their approved timetable for the conduct of their primaries and nomination of their candidates.\n\nHe stressed that it was dangerous for political parties to wait until the last day of the expiration of the period for the conduct of their primaries before conducting their party primaries and nominating their candidates\n\nHe recalled that in Ekiti State, the Commission fixed the 4th to the 29th January for the conduct of primaries and resolution of disputes arising from them, but regretted that most of the political parties in the state waited for the last two or three days before conducting their primaries .\n\nOkoye, similarly, indicted political parties for the same delayed conduct of primaries in Akure North/ Akure South federal Constituency, Ogoja/Yala federal Constituency, Akpabuyu State Constituency of Cross River State,Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency of Plateau State and Ngor Okpala State Constituency of Imo State.\n\n\u201cOnce the moment for the conduct of primaries elapses, we will not monitor such primaries. The implication is that the political party did not conduct primaries\u201d he warned\n\nHe, therefore, urged political parties to comply with and conform to the dictates of the Nigeria Constitution, the Electoral Act and the timetable and schedule of the activities of the Commission.",

The entire Galadiman Kogo has been deserted as hundreds of residents have fled to nearby Zumba community for refuge.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

They came through Galape and Kudodo, where they confiscated a vehicle and asked the driver to bring them to Galadiman Kogo. Some of them came on motorcycles, while others trekked. They were many that was why they were able to overpower the security men.\u201d\n\nChairman of Shiroro LGA, Mallam Suleiman Chukuba, confirmed the attack on Galadiman Kogo, but was not forthcoming with details of casualties. He, however, said the \u201csituation was terrible.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, following the bloody attack on Galadiman Kogo, our correspondent gathered that the Joint Security Task Force stationed at Kuchi in Munya has shut down the camp, with immediate effect.\n\nThe security agents were seen moving out of the community in the early hours of Sunday with their belongings, sending fear and panic to the people who were afraid of more attacks by bandits.\n\nThis development has equally led to mass movement of people from Kuchi town and other communities around Sarkin Pawa for fear of being attack by the gunmen.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report (11:00am, Sunday) people from Kuchi, Guni, Sabon Kabula, Mararaban Zagzaga, and Chibani, were seen moving out of the communities with their belongings.\n\nA source from Sarkin Pawa LGA, told our correspondent that the gunmen may be members of Boko Haram terrorist group, who currently assembling in Kusasu community in Munya.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere were fresh fears at the weekend over the possibility to hold the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the proposed February 26 date following the suggestion from the party\u2019s national leadership that the month of March would be more ideal for the exercise.\n\nThe APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) had last week issued a timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the convention, announcing that the activities would start on Monday (today) with the submission of the report by the National Reconciliation Committee.\n\nHowever, reacting to the February 26 proposed date, a member of the caretaker committee told Daily Sun that CECPC was still exploring other factors, especially the bye-elections fixed on the same date by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in addition to the outstanding Anambra State congresses, to confirm the viability of the February convention date.\n\nThe source further argued that the ideal date for the convention would have been March, but expressed the fear that the Caretaker Committee could come under severe attacks for the change of date. He, however, said the delay in writing to notify INEC has nothing to do with the consideration to shifting the convention till March.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, February 26 is sacrosanct for now until we receive a counter order from major stakeholders. Yes, we have not written to INEC, but we still have until February 5 to do so. We are aware that our failure to stick to the constitutional stipulation will heighten speculation over our readiness to conduct the convention.\n\n\u201cAgain, our failure to start the implementation of the timetable and schedule of actions we issued for the convention will be another factor that will fuel speculations. But you have to wait till Monday January 31 when the activities on our timetable will start. All you should understand is that the Caretaker Committee has limited powers because we are taking orders from above. Ours is to implement what has been handed over to us.\n\n\u201cYes, we take orders from Mr President and the governors forum, but we don\u2019t allow ourselves to be controlled by any other external forces the way they did to the immediate past National Working Committee (NWC).\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIt took the PDP three years to conduct their convention and are still struggling to conduct its zonal convention, why should Nigerians not put pressure on the PDP the way they are doing to the APC. If we have shifted the convention till March, won\u2019t Nigerians still be comfortable with us. We have appraised the situation and suggested that February 26 is not feasible, but many people accused us of all manner of things including the trick to delay the conduct of the exercise. March would have been the most appropriate time for us. We are still looking at many other variables and options.\n\n\u201cConducting convention is the simplest thing to do, but we have to be clinical about it. Ordinarily, the bye-elections would have affected our convention, but since many Nigerians want us to conduct the convention, we have to, even if INEC has 100 bye-elections. As far as the Caretaker Committee is concerned, the convention will hold as planned unless we receive a counter order from Mr. President, the Governors, and other major stakeholders. The general interest of the party should be paramount,\u201d he said.\n\nThe caretaker committee member, who prefered not to disclose his name, equally reacted to the pending conduct of congresses in Anambra, disclosing that security report was delaying it. \u201cI can tell you that the nomination forms are already on sale. We are just waiting for the security situation to know when we will go there and do something within one, two or three days.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, INEC has reminded the ruling party that February 5 is the deadline for issuing the commission with the notice of the convention, if it is still holding it on February 26.\n\nNational Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye and the Chief Press Secretary to the Chairman of the Commission, Rotimi Oyekanmi said the clash in the date for both the convention and bye-election will pose no challenge.\n\n\u201cWhat the commission will require to do is to just monitor the convention. I am also very sure the convention will not take place in any of the states we are going to conduct the bye-election. So, even if the date clashes, it will not pose any challenge to the commission conducting its bye-elections,\u201d Okoye said.",

Tambuwal, in his response, said he would begin consultations across the country.\n\nRising from a stakeholders meeting at the party Secretariat in the state capital, leaders of PDP expressed confidence in the leadership of Tambuwal and called on him to contest for the topmost position in Nigeria to rescue the country.\n\nResponding to the call, Tambuwal said he had never ventured into any political contest without seeking the approval and blessing of the people of his state as well as his constituency.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have listened to our party leaders, women and youths on the call that I should initiate and begin the process of consultations with a view of running and contesting for the President of Nigeria under the banner of our great party.\u201d\n\nGoing down memory lane, Tambuwal said: \u201cWhen members of the House of Representatives of the 7th Assembly approached with their desire for me to constest for the position of Speaker, I gave them certain conditions, one of which was that I have leaders \u2013 late President Shehu Shagari, former Governor Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko and two others in (Sokoto) state.\n\n\u201cI told them to go to my state and consult with these leaders. If they bless your initiative, I will accept your proposal and contest for the Speaker.\n\n\u201cWhen they came to Sokoto, President Shehu Shagari of blessed memory admonished them that: \u2018if you are putting our son forward as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, your efforts must not be sectional or religious.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks at the meeting, a former deputy governor of the state, Mukhtar Shagari, called on Governor Tambuwal to declare his interest in the presidency.\n\nShagari, who is also a former minister of Water Resources and a major stakeholder in the party, said it was time for Tambuwal to seek the presidency to rescue Nigeria from misgovernance.\n\nHe assured the governor that they were ready to extend their consultations to every part of the country.\n\nAlso speaking, Senator Danbaba Danbuwa, representing Sokoto South Senatorial District, who spoke on behalf of the members of the National Assembly from the state, said the time had come for Tambuwal presidency.\n\nHe said most of his colleagues in the National Assembly, especially those elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), had been calling on him to prevail on the governor to declare for president.\n\nHe disclosed that many Senators, irrespective of their political differences, promised to support the governor to become the next elected president in 2023.\n\nIn his remarks, a former Minister of Power, Engineer Bello Suleiman, said governor Tambuwal was the most qualified candidate for the job.\n\nHe said in terms of experience in governance, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, who is also eyeing the PDP ticket, did not have as much experience as Tambuwal in governance.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Checks revealed that only 12 per cent of global fintech founders and co-founders were women, and only six per cent of fintechs had female chief executive officers (CEOs).\n\nThe industry has experienced a high influx of women breaking grounds and leveraging financial technology (Fintech).\n\nAccording to the Fintech Association of Nigeria, foreign investors account for some 57 per cent of funding for Fintechs in the country. Furthermore, by increasing smartphone penetration, the association estimates that revenues in the space will reach $543 million this year.\n\nAlthough not having a fair share in the tech industry, Nigerian women are making genuine impact globally. In this report, THISDAY unveils 10 of these young women who are shattering the proverbial glass ceiling and making their marks in the world of technology and innovation.

          "text": "By Obinna Chima\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) digital currency, eNaira, has continued to attract the interest of Nigeria\u2019s banking public at home and across the world, with its total downloads hitting 694,000 exactly 95 days after it was unveiled.\n\nA breakdown of the figures exclusively obtained by THISDAY yesterday showed that as of last Friday, total downloads via iPhone Operating System (iOS) stood at 136,000, while that of Android was 558,000.\n\nIn terms of consumer wallets, the data showed that at 33 per cent, Guaranty Trust Bank was ahead of others, just as Ecobank was presently leading in terms of merchant wallet downloads at 22 per cent.\n\n\u201cDownloads have continued to increase to almost 700,000. ENaira wallets were downloaded from North America to Australia and all over Africa,\u201d the analysis stated.\n\nFurthermore, it showed that the app was also downloaded in South America, Europe, Asia, and in almost all the countries in Africa.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari launched the digital currency on October 25, 2021.\n\nBuhari had said with the eNaira, the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was projected to rise by $29 billion in the next 10 years. He had stressed that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nThe president had stated, \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, also said the eNaira would support a resilient payment ecosystem, encourage rapid financial inclusion, reduce the cost of processing cash, enable direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens, and increase revenue and tax collection.\n\nEmefiele had added, \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same naira with far more possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira \u2013 like the physical naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at one naira to one eNaira.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted recently that the eNaira had been \u201cdrawing substantial interest from the outside world\u201d since it was unveiled.\n\nHowever, IMF pointed out that, like digital currencies elsewhere, eNaira carried risks for monetary policy implementation, cyber security, operational resilience, and financial integrity and stability. It noted that although the digital currency was expected to increase financial inclusion and facilitate remittances, CBN should be prepared to manage the potential risk associated with managing a digital currency.\n\nIt stated that eNaira was the second central bank-backed digital currency fully open to the public after that of the Bahamas.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022$3.54bn joint venture debts offset since 2016\n\n\u2022$1.143bn still outstanding\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) paid an additional cash call arrears of $452,535,270 to its joint venture (JV) partners between November 2020 and November 2021, bringing to $3.54 billion the total debts it paid to the international oil companies (IOCs) since 2016, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nNew data from the national oil company indicated that among the five International Oil Companies (IOCs) being owed the backlog, Mobil Nigeria Producing and Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) had been fully settled as of November 31, 2021.\n\nThe figures gleaned from the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for January 2022, revealed that the two oil majors got a total of $833.7 million and $1.097 billion, respectively, since the arrears repayments started in 2016.\n\nHowever, a THISDAY analysis of the data showed that the NNPC still has an outstanding balance of $1.143 billion, according to the latest data, out of the negotiated total debt of $4.689 billion with the Joint Venture (JV) partners over five years ago.\n\nAside from Mobil and Chevron, other oil majors that are being owed arrears by the NNPC include Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Total Energies and Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC).\n\nWhile the SPDC has been paid $680.6 million so far, with an outstanding $691.9 million out of the initial $1.37 billion owed, Total as of November 31, 2021, had been paid $411.73 million with a balance of $199.2 million, out of total debt of $610.97 million.\n\nFurthermore, with an initial debt of $774.6 million owed NAOC, payment to date made to the oil company was $522.6 million, with an outstanding of $252 million.\n\nThe NNPC, in 2016, signed a cash call repayment agreement with its JV partners to defray cash-call arrears within five years after many years of its indebtedness to its partners.\n\nBefore then it had consistently for years failed to meet its indebtedness to the IOCs, a situation the operators said caused loss of new investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nAt the time, the Ministry of Petroleum Resources had negotiated a discount with the IOCs, comprising SPDC, Total, Mobil, Chevron and Agip from about $5.1 billion down to $4.68 billion and had since then continued to reduce the debt payments in instalments.\n\nThe NNPC further explained that in the case of SPDC, repayment was from the price balance distribution on Project Santolina; while in the case of CNL, repayment was from price balance distribution on Projects Cheetah and Falcon.\n\n\u201cNNPC has fully repaid its cash call arrears to MPN and all incremental barrels have reverted to base,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe cash call arrangements, under which NNPC had to pay for its 55 per cent to 60 per cent share of investment in the upstream joint ventures, had been in place for over 40 years before it was restructured.\n\nRecently, President Muhammadu Buhari had declared that the reforms initiated by his administration in 2015 when he took office, including the JV renegotiations, succeeded in saving the oil and gas industry in the country from total collapse.\n\nBuhari noted that, for instance, the payments of huge cash call backlog owed the country\u2019s JV partners took off a huge burden from the NNPC, saying that the current transparency drive in the national oil company was a product of those critical restructurings.\n\nThe president lamented that the sector which accounts for a huge source of foreign exchange for Nigeria, was in dire straits when he took over.\n\n\u201cWhen we were elected into office in 2015, the industry was in a very dire situation worsened by a backlog of Joint Venture (JV) Cash Call arrears.\n\n\u201cThe industry needed reforms to attract more investments and attract the needed revenue to support the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cAs a new administration, we needed to act fast to address the declining prospects of the industry and aggressively drive economic recovery and improve the country,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nAside from the cash call presentation before the joint committee, the NNPC in its data further explained that it would deduct N127 billion during next month\u2019s FAAC, for what it termed under-recovery.\n\nBut the N127 billion February projected petrol subsidy payment (for January) is far less than the N270 billion netted off the company\u2019s revenue in December 2021, accounting for the highest under-recovery paid yet.\n\n\u201cThe November 2021 value shortfall recovery on the importation of PMS (petrol) amounted to N270,831,143,856.56. The recovery consists of the November 2021 value shortfall of N220.110.853.427.56, plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N50,720,290,429.00 for October 2021.\n\n\u201cThe estimated value shortfall of N127.035,585.354.25 is to be recovered from January 2022 proceed due for sharing at the February 2022 FAAC meeting,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the information, the overall NNPC crude lifting of 8.31 million barrels (export & domestic crude) in November 2021 recorded a 7.78 per cent increase relative to the 7.71 barrels lifted in October 2021.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that Nigeria recorded an average production of 1.27 million barrels per day in November/December, while crude oil and gas export revenue received in December 2021 amounted to $5.13 million and $40.14 million respectively.\n\nNigeria LNG feedstock gas receipt was $113.39 million, including receipts of $51.85 million which slipped to December that ought to have been received in November 2021.\n\nFor other receipts, the NNPC data showed that the sum of $62.35 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas fees, as well as interest income was received in December 2021.\n\nIn addition, the sum of N352,518.463,538.25 was the gross domestic crude oil and gas revenue for December, while strategic holding cost and pipeline repairs amounted to N3,976,516,985.27 even as product losses amounted to N3,307,613,578.863.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Why did Binance block over 200 accounts in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, a Nigerian Twitter user Joshua Nwogo tweeted that Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange that processes 76 billion worth of transactions daily, had permanently blocked his account for 6 months. Accompanying the tweet were screenshots of his account balance, conversations he\u2019d had with a Binance customer representative, and four hashtags\u2014#boycottbinance #binancestopstealingcrypto #binancestopscamming #stoptradingonbinance\u2014calling the exchange giant a scam and urging other customers to stop using the platform.\n\nThe tweet picked up momentum due to how the supposed Binance representative handled the situation\u2014with cluelessness and threats. Within a few minutes, other disgruntled users had started reporting their own similar experiences with the platform. By Thursday, the matter had escalated and two of the hashtags were sitting on top of the Nigerian Twitter trends table.\n\nSince there was no response yet from Binance throughout Wednesday, people began to conjure different reasons as to why accounts are getting blocked. Some people said the platform is anti-African and is trying to shut the continent out of the cryptocurrency economy; others said the platform is stealing coins from Nigerians because it\u2019s aware the users are helpless as their government won\u2019t intervene.\n\nOn Thursday, Binance, through its Africa operation, made a Twitter thread apologising for inconveniences, assuring users of their commitment, and asking them to fill out a form that would help in tracking and resolving the issues quickly. A few hours later, they announced a YouTube ask-me-anything (AMA) session for the Nigerian community to address the concerns of users regarding account restrictions, user safety, and Binance peer-to-peer (P2P).\n\nAt 11 a.m. on Friday, the session, hosted by Dami Odufuwa, head of public relations at Binance Africa, alongside the Binance Africa community manager Nsikan Benjamin and the company\u2019s Africa Director Emmanuel Babalola, started and lasted for about an hour.\n\nAccording to Babalola, there are 2 reasons an account can be blocked: uncompleted know-your-customer (KYC) registration and detection of fraudulent activities, which he referred to as \u201claw enforcement agencies related issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have recorded over 200 cases of blocked accounts and counting, and 30% of them are fraud-related while the rest are a case of [incomplete] KYC,\u201d said Babalola. \u201cWe have started resolving these issues and also sent notifications to those whose cases are law enforcement-related.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKYC means users have to provide some means of identification before they can access some Binance products; their account could be blocked if they continue or try to access these products without completing their KYC.\n\nBut what exactly is a fraudulent activity? How can Binance tell if a transaction is fraudulent after coins have been exchanged across different addresses? And why are they allowing law enforcers into their backend? After all, it\u2019s the big ole crypto, popularly known as a means to escape the inconsistency and prying eyes of centralised financial institutions and their regulator buddies.\n\nThe backstory\n\nTo answer these questions, a little context will suffice. Throughout last year, Binance faced its biggest test: the platform came under aggressive scrutiny from an increasing number of regulators worldwide\u2014from the UK to the US, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Germany, Cayman Islands, Lithuania, and Hong Kong.\n\nThis was a result of countless concerns over the use of crypto to launder money and how Binance is an unchecked instrument of this activity. While several countries have started investigations into Binance and reduced its activities, others have banned anything that has to do with crypto completely.\n\nNot just countries, banks are also restricting access for crypto exchange as well. In June and July, several banks or payment processors in Europe and the UK, including Barclays, Nationwide, HSBC, and Santander, have subsequently cut off Binance\u2019s access or announced reviews of their approach to crypto at large. Same happened in Nigeria after the central bank ordered banks and financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions in February.\n\nEven though Binance has been making moves to incorporate anti-money laundering (AML) systems into its product since 2019, it seems little success has been achieved. As of today, there are still bad actors scamming and laundering money on the platform.\n\nFor instance, in December last year, Turkey\u2019s financial regulator fined Binance\u2019s Turkish arm $750,000 for non-compliance with AML requirements. Two weeks ago, Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) opened an investigation into a scam that defrauded investors out of over $100 million after hackers redirected the stolen money into 26 wallets registered on Binance.\n\nAll of these and more were reported to be the reason why Binance has chosen to double down its AML compliance and champion the cause of crypto regulation across the world full frontally. Last year it published Why Crypto Needs Regulation: Knowing Your 10 Fundamental Rights and followed it up with an opinion piece by Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder and CEO of Binance, to further explain why regulation is important at this stage of crypto adoption. This is the first time the exchange is openly seeking regulation rather than running away from it or accepting it.\n\nTo answer the question of how Binance can tell if a transaction is fraudulent after coins have been exchanged across different addresses: Binance, like many other big exchanges, now works with different regulators and law enforcement agencies globally to protect users and curb money laundering. Any account trading stolen coins will be instantly flagged for either review or outright blocking. And this explains what happened with the 30% of African users\u2019 accounts\u2014especially Nigerians\u2019\u2014that were blocked. It shows the platform is not only publishing articles but also taking action.\n\n\u201cCentralised exchanges have AML built-in to identify bad coins. Transaction monitoring tools are used and there are a number of companies that provide these tools including CipherTrace, Chainanalysis, and QLUE. Transactions can also be tracked on the blockchain by collaborating and discussing with other centralised exchanges,\u201d Binance Africa told TechCabal.\n\nIt\u2019s now regulatory compliance for centralised exchange to integrate blockchain analytics and monitoring tools that visually track, trace, and monitor illicit crypto activities on their platform. For example, following Binance 2019\u2019s partnership deal with Ciphertrace, the world\u2019s leading provider of cryptocurrency intelligence and blockchain security, to enhance the exchange\u2019s robust AML compliance program, Binance became the first exchange to deploy Traveler, the first commercial product created to help Virtual Asset Services Providers comply with global \u201ctravel rule\u201d regulations, in July 2021.\n\nGlobally, what makes a set of people love the blockchain and crypto concept is exactly what scares and creates distrust in a larger population who haven\u2019t adopted crypto yet: decentralisation and untraceability. Now that centralised exchanges are changing the narrative of the core concept of crypto, will this eliminate distrust, create some level of assurance, and then accelerate adoption or will this push more people away into full-on decentralised wallets and exchanges like MetaMask or a total rejection of crypto?\n\nWe don\u2019t know, as of the time of publication, the exact reason for blocking Joshua Nwogo\u2014one of the persons who started the campaign against the crypto giant and jolted others from their slumber\u2014but, according to the Binance Africa team, it can\u2019t be outside the 2 reasons which are incomplete KYC and detection of fraudulent transaction. But we are monitoring the story closely and will be reporting any new developments.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Bamboo, an investment platform that allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers, has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by American venture capital firms Greycroft and Tiger Global. Motley Fool Ventures, Saison Capital, Chrysalis Capital, and Y-Combinator\u2019s Michael Seibel also participated in the round, the company said.\n\nLaunched in January 2020 by CEO Richmond Bassey and COO Yanmo Omorogbe, Bamboo has rapidly grown in popularity with retail investors, claiming over 300,000 accounts in Nigeria. Its users can access all equities available on the US stock exchanges, that is, the stocks of roughly 6,000 companies.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: we want to give Africans and their asset managers easy, fast and secure access to global investment options that will allow them to earn real returns,\u201d Bassey said in a statement released Monday.\n\nWith the new funding, Bamboo plans to further accelerate its growth, doubling down on unlocking new markets and launching more products, it said while Bassey told TechCabal in an emailed response that Bamboo will be providing more asset classes and investment opportunities for its users.\n\n\u201cBamboo is enabling Africans to build wealth by creating an investing platform that is helpful to both experienced investors and to those new to the stock market. We are thrilled to support the innovative, user-first approach the Bamboo team is bringing to market,\u201d Greycroft Partner Alison Lange Engel said on the investment.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLast year, the company launched Powered by Bamboo, its API solution that allows asset managers, fintech companies, and other financial institutions to plug into Bamboo\u2019s API to provide their customers access to global securities. The company has been testing the product with a small group of companies and expects to onboard more this year.\n\n\u201cEveryone building for African investors is welcome. We plan to add other products and tools that offer greater access and make global investing simpler from Africa,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the technology infrastructure powering financial services in Africa.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, Bamboo announced plans to launch in Ghana and has since seen more than 50,000 Ghanaians join the waitlist, according to the company. In the near future, Bamboo plans to expand into more markets such as Kenya and South Africa, Bassey said.\n\nCompared to developed markets such as the United States, investing in stocks is relatively new in Nigeria, and Africa at large. For instance, nearly 75% of Bamboo users have never traded stocks before.\n\nThus, the company has had to put significant effort into educating its users on how to invest and become better investors, using a mix of regular educational content published on its social media, a stock market course, an investment bootcamp, newsletters with investing tips and exclusive value-added services from top investment advisors like The Motley Fool and MyWallSt.\n\nThese efforts appear to pay off, going by Bamboo\u2019s figures. In 2021, repeat depositors made up 85% of deposits on the platform, an indication that Bamboo users are rapidly gaining confidence in trading US stocks.\n\nBut with the US equities market experiencing its worst January in well over a decade\u2014since 2009\u2014how are Bamboo users reacting to the downturn?\n\n\u201cEven though they are new to stock investing, Bamboo users tend to handle their emotions like more seasoned investors,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe saw this during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crash and we\u2019re seeing it again now.\u201d\n\nBamboo allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers.\n\nAfrica\u2019s wealth management market remains largely underdeveloped but holds high potential. According to data cited by Bamboo, Africans account for over 16% of the world\u2019s population, yet they own less than 1% of global wealth.\n\nBut that is expected to change over the next decade, with private wealth in the continent expected to increase by 30% to reach $2.6 trillion by 2030, according to AfrAsia Bank.\n\nBassey is upbeat platforms like Bamboo will play a major role in realising the projected growth, by helping to develop an investing culture among Africans.\n\n\u201cWe think investing in stocks has a bright future in Nigeria. Nigerians are hungry to earn a return on their investments and build wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bullish on platforms such as ours in bringing more Nigerians into the world of investing.\u201d\n\nWithout revealing many details, Bamboo says in the statement it plans to make it seamless for African investors in the diaspora to discover the best investment opportunities on the continent.\n\nIn August, Nigeria\u2019s central bank received court approval to freeze the bank accounts of Bamboo and other similar Nigerian fintech platforms for a six-month period. However, Bassey confirmed the company received a court order unfreezing its accounts. \u201cAll have been unfrozen now,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "He built TikTok's strategy in Africa, now he's building Kippa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nTikTok made huge waves when it announced its sponsorship of the African Cup of Nations, the continent\u2019s biggest football tournament. Kennedy Ekezie-Joseph who helped lead TikTok\u2019s entry into Africa, was no longer with the company for that moment of triumph. Instead, he was grinding away at a new startup. Big mistake? Maybe not.\n\nLeaving a budding career at social networking behemoth that has big ambitions on your home continent, to launch a startup, sounds like a suicidal move. But for Ekezie-Joseph, 23, who was part of a small group that led TikTok\u2019s foray into Africa and was well-positioned to benefit from the company\u2019s continental ambitions, it actually wasn\u2019t. That much became clear when his startup attracted record seed funding.\n\nEkezie-Joseph\u2019s startup, Kippa, is a bookkeeping and finance app that he founded with Duke Ekezie (his brother) and Jephthah Uche in February 2021. It has had a meteoric trajectory since its launch in June.\n\nIn November, the startup hauled in $3.2 million in pre-seed funding, arguably one of the largest early-stage fund-raises in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile phone and Whatsapp-friendly, Kippa targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SME\u2019s) providing them with free, easy-to-use accounting software. Kippa then looks at potential financing opportunities and makes revenue by taking commission fees and earning interest by lending companies working capital.\n\nTo date, more than a billion dollars in transactions have been recorded by the platform, according to the founders.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria today, there are 47 million SMEs, according to SMED Analyst statistics out there. About 280,000 merchants out of that number, have used the product. And our goal is over the next five to 10 years to capture as much of that number as possible, by building out new features, by launching new product lines,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said in an interview with bird.\n\nAs a child, Ekezie-Joseph saw first-hand how the absence of judicious record-keeping could impact fragile and shock-prone micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n\u201cMy dad had a small business around when I was born, which he lost. And so for me, it really means a lot to build for a segment that I feel very intimately familiar with,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nF-R: Duke, Japhthah, and Kennedy, co-founders of Kippa\n\nKippa (a play on book\u201dkeeper\u201d) is a bookkeeping mobile app that allows small business owners to keep track of their daily income and expense transactions, issue invoices, provide receipts to their customers and create marketing materials like business cards.\n\nThe app also keeps track of debtors who owe the subscriber companies money.\n\nWhen he launched Kippa, Ekezie-Joseph knew from personal experience that he was addressing an existential threat to businesses. This gave him and his team confidence.\n\nTrue to their projection, Kippa was an instant hit at launch, striking a chord with thousands of SMEs in Nigeria, underlining the opportunities and the demand for this particular service.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, SMEs have been laggers when it comes to the adoption of digital technology. What we\u2019ve seen is digital technology has changed very many other industries \u2013 healthcare, transport \u2013 but the way businesses are run and the overall back-office operations are still very manual, they\u2019ve really not changed since the 60s,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re trying to do here is unite the tailwind of the deep penetration of the internet that is continuing to grow across the continent and the smartphone penetration. So by 2025, Nigeria alone will contribute 4 per cent of total new smartphone users in the world. And we think that\u2019s such an exciting deal in that, companies like us are building on the back of to provide tools that business owners can use on these devices that they have.\u201d\n\nKennedy Ekezie-Joseph presented with a Queen\u2019s Young Leaders Award in 2018 for his work in promoting women\u2019s rights in the areas of female genital mutilation (FGM), domestic abuse and forced child marriage and access to education for girls.\n\nEkezie-Joseph and his team are now planning another round of fundraising to scale the company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cSo we will be talking to investors over the next couple of months. And one of the big things we believe in is building relationships early and taking time to identify the right partners to work with. So if we do meet investors who are the right fit, we\u2019ll be able to work with them,\u201d he said.\n\nEkezie-Joseph was an early recipient of the prestigious Yenching Scholarship, a masters program at the elite Peking University in Beijing, China.\n\nA top Nigerian debater while still at college, as a 16-year-old college freshman, he had already begun using his voice to change his community, founding a social enterprise that worked to end the practice of female genital mutilation in communities and increase access to education for young girls.\n\nWith two TEDx talks under his belt, a Barack Obama Young African Leaders Fellowship and a Resolution Fellowship and numerous recognitions and accolades, Ekezie-Joseph has a track record of success despite his young age.\n\nA master\u2019s degree from an elite academy at Beijing\u2019s top research university must have made Ekezie-Joseph a shoo-in at TikTok, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance. He was part of the early expansion of TikTok into Africa. But the experience at a university that has given rise to some of the world\u2019s greatest tech companies and spawned dozens of top global entrepreneurs, may have also given him bigger ambitions.\n\n\u201cI was the first line here and had the team to lead our acquisition and growth for the company\u2019s expansions. Africa? We had a couple thousand users of the product, then. And you know, we\u2019ve gone from then, 2018, to today being the third-most-used social app in Africa, with tens of millions of users,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging the economic impact of COVID-19 on the continent, Ekezie-Joseph noted that it had helped fuel the growth of the tech industry and internet adoption in Africa.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time many merchants understood that they could do business online. That was the first time many consumers understood that they could transact with merchants online. So it almost helped us leapfrog the absence of trust around digital tools. And that\u2019s been super helpful. And more and more people are doing business online now. So that is very significant for our growth as a business,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the early conversion of bookkeepers and small business owners, Ekezie-Joseph is the first to admit that there are plenty of hurdles ahead.\n\n\u201cTo bring the right people in the door, bring the most experienced people in the industry and have them around the table working with us pursuing the mission. And so that means bringing regulators on board, you know, people will have experience engaging with them, and industry veterans. So that is a very big one for us,\u201d he said in an interview with the bird story agency.\n\n\u02dc\u201dThe second thing is also executing on our roadmap\u2026the way we think about it last year, we built a really solid product and validated the need for it in the market. And this is truly the year we build processes around that and leverage that and we continue to build at breakneck speed for all users and establish our place in the market.\u201d\n\nSo have there been misgivings over leaving TikTok?\n\n\u201cNo! The plan was always to eventually move back to Nigeria and build a startup and the onset of the pandemic in China, gave me the perfect reason to make the move back and take the leap,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Uber, the poster child for tech disruption, decided to enter its second African country, Nigeria. Basically, when a company makes such a decision, it would have to take the necessary steps to be considered legally operative in that country and do specific research on how to fit the product brand into that locality.\n\nAs Uber was the first of many ride-hailing apps in the country, it was virtually high-risk for the company. It had to comply with all local standards and rules relating to its product offering and model even when there wasn\u2019t a competitor to benchmark against.\n\nTo handle this, Uber contacted a law firm that provides such services \u2014 market entry, permit authorisation, and advisory requirements \u2014 for multinational companies looking to enter Africa. Typically, companies like this often go the route of getting multiple legal counsels in all the jurisdictions they want to operate in.\n\nEunice Olopade (CEO) and Usman Sotunde (CTO), lawyers working in the law firm, thought about how cool it would be if all these could be done on a single interface. With years of experience in the bag, they decided to build a simple system that works. Soon, along with Abdulwaheed Yusuf (COO), they co-founded Sidebrief, a registration tech (regtech) startup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEunice Olopade, Co-founder/CEO, Sidebrief. Source: Supplied\n\nUp until the last decade, continental and international expansion wasn\u2019t a thing among African startups. The region\u2019s fragmented nature has been a major challenge for global companies looking to enter the continent.\n\n\u201cThere was no single platform where you could get information about access into the African market. If you wanted to get into the African market today and you had the intention to enter five countries, you\u2019ll have to interface with multiple lawyers, multiple advisors, multiple regulatory bodies to be able to set up across these different markets,\u201d Olopade hints.\n\nUnfortunately, startups based in Africa aren\u2019t insulated from this challenge. On paper, the introduction of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2019 was expected to cause a boost in trade, economic growth, and integration across the continent. However, not much has been achieved so far.\n\nAnd this is where Sidebrief comes into play. Its intention is \u201c\u2026 sharing the roadmap on how to effectively expand across jurisdictions without having to hire somebody here and there.\u201d\n\nAnd this is not limited to African countries, as Olopade confirms that the regtech startup also assists African founders with incorporation, tax registration, tax returns, and overall structuring for those that have their holding companies outside the continent, like Delaware, US.\n\nHarmonising cross-border expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlopade points out that simply hiring lawyers in all the locations could affect the validity of the overall set-up of the business as they may not always provide definitive information about all requirements.\n\nShe adds that the role of legal entities often ends with company incorporation. Meanwhile, there are tax registration requirements to be fulfilled, business-specific certifications to acquire, and industry licences/permits to get. With no access to such information, set-up is always incomplete.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a platform that helps not only with market entry but with business compliance across several countries in Africa. Ongoing business compliance is arguably more important than just setting up, so the platform that we\u2019ve built over time is what we primarily use to ensure that our clients and prospective clients are up to date on their business compliance requirements while running their businesses. There was a gap here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrusting the process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidebrief does not only give access to the necessary information and assist companies with all the steps, but it also saves them the stress of having to make any contact with the organisations issuing licenses or permits. Basically, engaging lawyers directly would demand more money and time \u2014 in terms of billable hours \u2014 same with trying to get the attention of regulatory authorities.\n\nOlopade boasts about the seamless nature of the Sidebrief platform\u2018s transaction process.\n\n\u201cEverything that we do, from corporate registrations to tax to intellectual property registrations can be done on the platform. Once you sign-up on the platform, we take it from there. If we need to reach out to you for more information, we\u2019ll do that. But primarily, once you provide all the necessary information and upload the required documents, you could go ahead and pay.\u201d\n\nDue to the low-trust nature of the African market, Sidebrief also issues invoices on request or arranges virtual calls or physical visits for negotiations.\n\nAfter payment, Sidebrief engages the regulatory authority on behalf of the client, gets the requested document, and uploads it into the customer\u2019s account. This is followed by a prompt. As is standard practice, duration and cost are determined by the market and services required.\n\n\u201cProduct pricing differs across markets, we offer one time fees and bundled services depending on add ons but we are moving towards a uniform fee across markets. Entity Incorporation, Tax Registration and IP Registration are just the basics. There are several other layers we are now building on the stack which we will be rolling out, like cross-border tax management.\u201d\n\nServices can be delivered between 24 hours to a few weeks and could cost between $200 to $5,000, which Olopade believes is highly competitive compared to individuals.\n\nOne major metric considered in ranking countries\u2019 ease of doing business is how long it takes to set up and begin operating a business. This indicator comprises the procedure, time, and cost of corporate registration, asset registration, securing permits, and enforcing contracts, among others. To an extent, these could be determining factors as Sidebrief offers its services.\n\nThe founder, however, says this doesn\u2019t affect the entire value offering chain. She adds that the team is currently working on product pricing and creating a synergy such that the fragmented nature of the African market does not adversely impact its offerings. Nevertheless, there are currently fixed prices per market.\n\nNot just \u2018a\u2019 competitive advantage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 2019, Sidebrief is the brainwork of two lawyers and an accountant who have played in the companies registration space and have occupied similar roles in various global companies.\n\nCurrently, the startup comprises 15 professionals manning its different rolling parts in different markets. The team\u2019s efforts are complemented by existing relationships with a network of regulators across all the African markets it operates in, which tells the story of its success so far.\n\nAlthough Sidebrief is working to cover all 54 African countries, it has capacity in over 30 countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Senegal, Egypt, Morocco, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, and Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidebrief team. Source: Supplied\n\nHow did the startup pull this off in less than three years?\n\nOlopade attests that this is in part hinged on the founders\u2019 solid professional backgrounds and interests.\n\n\u201cHaving worked on the World Bank Doing Business project, it exposed me to a lot about starting and doing business in Africa, the challenges and the prospects. Interacting and interviewing lawyers across several countries and understanding the diverse legal and regulatory compliance framework as part of the data collection process across several countries highlighted the need for digitalizing and automating processes,\u201d she speaks of her experience.\n\nAs easy as this looks, some countries have proven more difficult than others. In the World Bank Doing Business Report for 2019, Rwanda (38th) was the only African country among the top 50 countries; Morocco and Kenya came close, ranking 53rd and 56th, respectively. Meanwhile, Nigeria occupied the 131st position.\n\nFor Olopade, the situation hasn\u2019t improved in Nigeria, which has proven to be one of the toughest markets to deal in. Meanwhile, in East Africa, it has been quite challenging with respect to the hiring process and getting the right talent fit. In addition to that, technological adoption is a general problem with the African market because regulatory parastatals have only a few automated processes.\n\nSidebrief plans to attract and serve more clients within the coming months such that it becomes a household name when it comes to cross-border expansion in Africa. Olopade mentions how the startup has enjoyed a first-mover advantage and referrals from startups like 54gene, OkHi, Spleet, and Shuttlers, among others.\n\nThere are also plans to build a robust technology that will automate virtually all processes on the platform to make it seamless for customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

This comes with a free debit card available at all NIPOST outlets.\n\nThe postal services provider also unveiled 27 new logistics vehicles for courier services in partnership with international cargo and freight company, Speedaf Express.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, this would aid Nigeria\u2019s digital economy plans and foster financial inclusion.\n\nEssentially, think of NIPOST as acting as another OPay or Kudi with Point of Sales (PoS) outlets where you can send and receive money using NIPOST\u2019s debit card.\n\nBecause the card relies heavily on the user\u2019s biometric information \u2014 like fingerprints \u2014 it would work both online and offline.\n\nThe last few years have been interesting ones for NIPOST. From interesting policies to a possible overhaul, it seems there\u2019s still more to come.\n\nUntil then, you can catch up on some of these stories here.\n\nCrypto beyond trading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuth Iselema at Build 2021\n\nFor most of us crypto-indifferents, the current bearish \u2014 thank you Google for coming to my rescue \u2014 market is two-faced. To some extent, it rationalises our decision not to use that last \u20a610,000 ($24) to buy some Bitcoin or Shiba Inu.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s also an opportunity to possibly cash in and get good returns whenever the market turns bullish. \u201cBuy the dip!!\u201d has been the chosen mantra since November 2021, when Bitcoin prices began to fall.\n\nBut as I\u2019ve heard so many times in the last year, there\u2019s more to crypto than trading. Notice I don\u2019t mention blockchain? There are alternative uses to cryptocurrency other than the most popular use case in Africa, which appears to be buying and selling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUse cases like lending, insurance \u2014 or decentralised finance (DeFi), as Bolu calls it in his article \u2014 speak of alternative and, dare I say, exciting applications of cryptocurrency.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, our Reporter, Bolu Abiodun, talked to Ruth Iselema, Bitmama\u2019s CEO, about crypto, DeFi and everything else in between. You can find his article here: There\u2019s more to crypto than buying low and selling high\n\nIf you are more into audio-visuals, then you can follow this link to watch.\n\nMeanwhile, you can browse through pictures of the event here.\n\nCredit analysis with Periculum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow of hands if you\u2019ve ever tried to get a loan from the bank and gave up after seeing the stringent conditions and the many steps.\n\nI can\u2019t pinpoint the exact time I started hearing about loan apps like Renmoney, Carbon, FairMoney, but apps like this rose to give the average citizen quick access to loans.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, that doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problem: creditworthiness data.\n\nWhen giving out loans, banks \u2014 and any other financial institution really \u2014 need information about the loan applicant. One of the most important is whether the applicant can repay the loan, also known as creditworthiness.\n\nAfter working at several Canadian banks and starting a few businesses, Michael Temitope Collins found some information that informed his decision to start Periculum.\n\n\u201cI started out working in the bank and discovered that we have many underserved customers, so I decided to do some research.\n\n\u201cI realised that even in Canada, there\u2019s a pretty significant number of people that are underserved by the financial system. When you scale that out to emerging markets like Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, that number of underserved individuals is a lot higher.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, Periculum was born.\n\nCurious about what they do?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based healthtech, roHealth has rolled out a free health coverage plan for Small and Medium-scale Businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThis announcement coincides with its partnership with PayCentre and ConnectNigeria as CEO Olalekan Olude told Techpoint Africa at roHealth\u2019s official launch in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are a platform that gives employees greater decision-making control over their health insurance with cashback when it is not used. Employers use the platform by uploading their employees and setting a budget. Employees can then choose from over 100 Health Plans from top HMOs in Nigeria\u201d Olude told Techpoint at the event.\n\n\u201croHealth is on a mission to increase access to healthcare in Nigerians by providing free health insurance for a limited period. A lot of companies do not trust HMOs and believe that they do not provide value to their employees. We are here to give them the opportunity to get their employees to try it out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlalekan Olude, roHealth CEO\n\nPaycentre is one of the biggest Agent Banking Networks in the Country with over 80,000 Agents nationwide while Connect Nigeria is an online database with more than 300,000 companies offering information about businesses, real estate, technology, entertainment, and more.\n\nConnect Nigeria houses close to 300,000 companies and for us, it is a strategic synergy \u2013 between a healthcare platform and another platform that wants to preach the message of delivering healthcare to its customers.\n\nWith access to roHealth\u2019s APIs, its partners can achieve their goals of bringing Healthcare closer to their customers and staff. These partnerships would help roHealth reach millions of Nigerians faster.\n\n\u201cNigerians have different health needs and budgets, but what we\u2019ve realised from our partners is that partnering with one HMO excludes them from working with another. But working with roHealth as a partner creates that opportunity to be able to connect as many HMOs as possible by connecting to the roHealth APIs as a service\u201d.\n\nBusinesses with a minimum of 5 Staff can access this offering on the roHealth website \u2013 https://www.rohealth.ng/free-trial and benefits covering Laboratory, Accidents, Surgery, and other medical expenses.\n\nLaunching in Nigeria\n\nOlalekan believes that the future of healthcare Insurance would largely be a function of coverage funded by someone.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, Healthcare is usually paid for by the government, through taxes or by the employer in part or in full, but a lot of Nigerians are exposed to zero healthcare coverage and this is because the channels through which they consume services haven\u2019t thought about giving healthcare to them or covering them as their customers or workers.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to deliver the opportunity for all Nigerians to have healthcare coverage wherever they may be through an employer, the informal sector, or services \u2014 buying data, airtime, food, etc \u2014 that they use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis launch is a pilot for expansion across Africa where it can deploy its solution which allows employees to choose healthcare plans that fit them within a set budget by their employer.\n\nAt the event, Olude said there are plans to work with banks, retail shops, and businesses, among others, to enable customers to get healthcare coverage after spending a certain amount within a month.\n\n\u201cSay, for example, you buy stuff at Shoprite, based on some of the partnerships we are working on, once you buy products up to a certain amount, Shoprite automatically covers your healthcare for that month.\u201d\n\nA customer who meets the requirements is automatically covered for that month, without having to change their lifestyle or their spending pattern.\n\nSince its inception 6 months ago, over 500 businesses and 10000 lives actively use roHealth to make their health coverage decisions.

That is why I personally appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari when it became clear that he was in the process of creating six more colleges of education. For us, we were very specific that we wanted a college of education that will train teachers in technical subjects because that aligns with our plans as a government.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to retool the educational system of this country and Edo State. Today, we can proudly say that we have started an educational revolution in Edo. The children being produced from our basic educational system today, in terms of literacy, almost peer with their mates globally and the records are there.\u201d\n\nAssuring the NCCE delegation on the government\u2019s commitment to ensure the school kicks off academic activities despite the antics of some detractors, Obaseki noted, \u201cThat school was shut down five years ago; it was shut down for us to start a university. The same trouble that led to the shutdown of that school is what they are trying to make with this new one. They frustrated the school for making progress and they want to frustrate this school too from making progress.\n\n\u201cThey are claiming what they didn\u2019t work for because we have set up our own state college of education. When we built our own school, they said we should absorb them into our new school.\n\n\u201cDuring my reelection, they were acting as active politicians, but we cannot sacrifice the future of our children for their selfish gains. They claimed that we owe them, but it is not true. Till tomorrow, they cannot give you the evidence of the school fees they have collected, but we can show you the evidence of subversions we have put in the school.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey have tried to go to court; they\u2019ve done a lot of publications, and now it\u2019s just blackmailing and as a government, we won\u2019t subject ourselves to blackmails. Even yesterday, they wrote me a letter of apology. But they\u2019ve gone back, front, left, right, and centre. But as a government, we remain focused. We know where we are going and if they have legitimate claims by now they would have gone to court to get court orders.\n\n\u201cWhy have they not opted for that option? Why are they going to barricade the road and embarrass people who want to inspect the facilities? For us, I think this is a politically-motivated action and I don\u2019t think it has a legal basis to stop what we want to do.\n\n\u201cIf they feel they\u2019ve been disenfranchised; they should go to court. We, as a government, will always obey court orders. So, whatever cooperation you need from me, we will give you. We\u2019ve fought tough political battles; hence, this one is a joke. We\u2019ve brought godfathers down and if the godfathers have gone back to mobilize them, they are just joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t stop the education and future of our children. We will provide whatever support and cooperation that the federal government needs to ensure that this school can be opened to enable us to begin to train our teachers,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Secretary of NCCE, Prof. Paulinus Okwelle, expressed appreciation to the governor for providing infrastructure for the take-off of the school.\n\nHe added: \u201cOnce again, we congratulate you for attracting this new federal institution to Edo. In 2019, President Buhari approved six colleges of education in each zone and the one in Ekiadolor to serve the South-South. We\u2019ve gone round the site of the college and discovered a lot of good things and we must appreciate your efforts.\u201d.\n\n...",

Barbed wire topped fences are everywhere, surrounding the buildings and even one of the compound\u2019s basketball courts.\n\nThe compound is home to some of the more than 300,000 migrant workers who live and work in Singapore, but even as the island eases some coronavirus restrictions to allow the fully vaccinated to travel again, the people here and in the city-state\u2019s many other worker dormitories have no such freedoms.\n\n\u201cIt gives us an inferiority complex because before COVID-19 we could go outside, use transport, do everything, we never thought that we were overseas workers,\u201d said 36-year-old Narayan, who comes from Bangladesh and works in construction.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNow we cannot go outside and now we remember that we are overseas workers. It is not normal life,\u201d said Narayan, who requested anonymity for fear of losing his job.\n\nFor two years, workers like Narayan have been living under strict COVID-19 controls.\n\nThe only time they leave their dormitory compounds is to go to work. If they want to visit the recreation centres set up for them nearby, they must use a phone app to apply for an exit pass, which enables them to leave the dorm.\n\nA maximum of 3,000 fully vaccinated workers are allowed out into the wider community each weekday, with double that number able to visit public places on weekends and holidays. Most of the men work six days a week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuch a controlled existence is in stark contrast to the lives of other Singapore residents for whom life is finally returning to some sort of normality as the country moves towards \u201cliving with COVID-19\u201d.\n\nNarayan, who has been in Singapore for almost 10 years, is growing increasingly frustrated by the restrictions on his life.\n\n\u201cWe (the workers) hope the government can think about us. We are human. We cannot stay in the dormitories for so long. Especially for our mental health, it is not normal life.\u201d\n\nWhen COVID-19 first arrived in Singapore some two years ago, the government managed to keep control of the situation through a meticulous contact tracing system. The country stayed open, with just relatively minor restrictions imposed.\n\nBut once cases began to emerge among migrant workers, the virus tore through their cramped accommodation.\n\n\u201cDue to their in-dormitory living conditions which do not allow much room for proper isolation, dormitory-dwelling migrant workers would be more susceptible to infectious diseases,\u201d Michael Cheah, Executive Director of HealthServe, a non-profit group that provides medical care to workers, told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany of the men work as manual labourers in the kind of physically demanding jobs that Singaporeans prefer not to do.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government does not provide a breakdown of their nationalities, but most come from South Asia.\n\n\u201cWhen the pandemic hit in the first year, migrant workers had accounted for almost 90 percent of the confirmed cases in Singapore. This led to dormitory lockdowns and prolonged movement restrictions for the disadvantaged group,\u201d said Cheah.\n\nThe first full dormitory lockdowns were imposed in April 2020. Workers were instructed to stay in their dorms and warned against mixing with other workers in common areas.\n\nAt the time, the island itself was in what the government called a \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d lockdown, but since then, the divide between the workers inside, and the rest of the community outside, has been impossible to ignore.\n\nMigrant workers are almost entirely cut off from the general public. They are transported around Singapore in the back of lorries and are often only seen at the entrances of building sites or preparing to work on the roads late at night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any difference between a person living in a jail and me. I feel isolated because of the COVID rules and I feel very sad about the difference in the lives between me and the rest of the people,\u201d said 30-year-old labourer Mohammed, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.",

She cared, she loved, she laughed and she shined.\n\n\u201cCheslie embodied love and served others, whether through her work as an attorney fighting for social justice, as Miss USA and as a host on EXTRA,\u201d her family said.\n\n\u201cBut most importantly as a daughter, sister, friend, mentor and colleague \u2014 we know her impact will live on.\u201d\n\nKryst, who lived on the ninth floor of the building, was alone when she jumped and was last seen on a 29th-floor terrace, sources said.\n\nSources said Kryst left behind a note saying she wanted to leave everything to her mother, a former pageant competitor herself who was crowned Mrs. North Carolina in 2002. The note didn\u2019t include a motive for Kryst\u2019s actions, sources said.\n\n\u201cNot only beautiful but she was smart \u2014 she was a lawyer,\u201d a police source said of Kryst.\n\n\u201cShe has a life that anyone would be jealous of. \u2026 It\u2019s so sad.\u201d\n\nKryst, a former Miss North Carolina, won top honors at the 2019 Miss USA pageant, wearing a sparkly winged outfit for the National Costume competition, a nod to Maya Angelou\u2019s \u201cI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\u201d\n\nKryst also worked as a reporter for ExtraTV.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are broken,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCheslie was not just a vital part of our show. She was a beloved part of our Extra family and touched the entire staff. Our deepest condolences to all her family and friends.\u201d\n\nIn October 2019, Kryst spoke out on Facebook for World Mental Health Day, offering tips on how she coped with stress.\n\n\u201cI do a lot to make sure that I maintain my mental health,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd the most important thing that I did is talk to a counselor. She\u2019s really easy to talk to. She gives me great strategies especially if I\u2019m sad or happy or have a busy month ahead of me.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m not talking to my counselor, I spend time at the end of every single day to just decompress,\u201d Kryst added. \u201cI unplug, I shut my phone off, I don\u2019t answer messages. I just sit and watch my favorite movies.\u201d\n\nIn 2020 she discussed the issue again in an interview with The Hilltop.\n\n\u201cThere are three things that I\u2019m doing with regard with self-care,\u201d Kryst said. \u201cNo. 1, I try to set a regular schedule so my alarm rings every day at 6:45. I know that I\u2019m getting up and I\u2019m starting my day.\n\n\u201cTwo, I try to set very clear boundaries, so even though I\u2019m at home and I\u2019ve got my computer, my phone with me, I\u2019m done answering emails at 6 o\u2019clock, I\u2019m not responding to messages. It\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nThird, she said, \u201cI have a regular workout schedule that keeps my body healthy and my mind sharp.\u201d\n\nNew York Post",

We speculated that some things were done by Nigerians in terms of not obeying the law of the host country. So, we came up with the solution to speak to ourselves to be law-abiding, to appeal and pacify to the UAE government to allow all categories of jobs to be given to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cBecause these jobs that they are not giving to Nigerians is being given to people of other nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe #iamNigerian campaign is aimed to project us positively. Nigerians are now aware that there is a problem in our hands. We have left the stage of denial and realised that there is a problem, and it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to play a role,\u201d Ogungbohun explained.\n\nHe added that the campaign which commenced 14 days ago is helping to project Nigerians and how Nigerian professionals contribute to UAE\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fold our hands and do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a resident of Fujerah in UAE, Esther Adedokun insists that the problem is not necessarily due to atrocities committed by Nigerians resident in UAE but a diplomatic row between both countries.\n\nRELATED: \u2018We Are Starving Here,\u2019 Nigerians In UAE Lament Work Permit Restrictions\n\nShe also explained how the permit restriction has left her stranded.\n\n\u201cMy situation is so critical that I have spent all my savings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to have the impression that because of the atrocities committed by some Nigerians, that is why we have this problem. Nigerians are not the only citizens in UAE that commit worse crimes and they are there are no restrictions on their work permits.\n\n\u201cI am against crime and criminality but the diplomatic issue if resolved will ease the problem of this restriction,\u201d she said in the interview.\n\nOver seven months, hundreds of Nigerians in UAE became jobless and homeless following a change in diplomatic policy which led to the restriction of work permits.\n\nThe policy has left many Nigerians in pathetic conditions and most of the victims have lost their jobs.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThis has led to frustration with many rendered homeless.

          "text": "Mali on Monday said it was expelling the French ambassador in the light of \u201chostile\u201d comments, a move likely to ratchet up tensions with its former colonial ruler and ally following a military coup.\n\nA statement read on national television said, \u201cThe ambassador of France in Bamako, his excellency Joel Meyer\u2026 was notified of the decision of the government asking him to leave the national territory within 72 hours.\u201d\n\nThe move raises further questions over France\u2019s continued military support for Mali, a deeply poor country battling a nearly decade-long jihadist campaign.\n\nThe French foreign ministry issued a brief statement saying it \u201ctakes note\u201d of the announcement and expressed \u201csolidarity with its European partners\u201d \u2014 its allies in the anti-jihadist mission.\n\nREAD ALSO: African Union Suspends Burkina Faso After Coup\n\nRelations between the two countries began to fray after the army seized power in Bamako in August 2020, and worsened after the junta staged a second coup in May 2021.\n\nLast week, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters that Mali\u2019s junta was \u201cillegitimate\u201d and its decisions \u201cirresponsible\u201d.\n\nDefence Minister Florence Parly also accused the country\u2019s rulers of stepping up \u201cprovocations\u201d of France.\n\nMonday\u2019s statement in Bamako said remarks had been made that were \u201chostile and outrageous\u201d, and had been uttered \u201cdespite repeated protests\u201d by Mali.\n\n\u201cThe Malian government vigorously condemns and rejects these remarks, which are contrary to the development of friendly relations between nations,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, it added, the Malian government \u201creiterates its readiness to maintain dialogue and pursue cooperation with all its international partners, including France, in mutual respect and on the basis of the cardinal principle of non-interference.\u201d\n\nMeyer, the French ambassador, was appointed to Bamako in October 2018.\n\nCoup sparked friction\n\nRebel officers led a coup in August 2020 that toppled Mali\u2019s elected leader Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who was facing angry protests at failures to stem the jihadists.\n\nThe following May, the junta pushed out a civilian-led government appointed to oversee a transition period and named strongman Colonel Assimi Goita as interim president.\n\nBy year\u2019s end, France and its European allies were alarmed at the junta\u2019s reported decision to hire mercenaries from the Russian paramilitary group Wagner.\n\nFrance \u2014 which stages presidential elections in April \u2014 repeatedly warned that it would be untenable for its forces to fight alongside unaccountable mercenaries.\n\nRussian \u201cadvisors\u201d in the Central African Republic have been accused of carrying out abuses of civilians.\n\nTensions have also risen since the West Africa bloc ECOWAS imposed a trade embargo and\n\nThe sanctions followed a junta proposal to stay in power for up to five years before staging\n\nborder closures with Mali on January 9, in a move backed by France, the United States and the European Union.\n\nThe sanctions followed a junta proposal to stay in power for up to five years before staging elections, despite an earlier commitment to hold a vote by the end of February 2022.\n\nFrench pullback\n\nAs friction worsened last year, France started scaling back 5,100-man Barkhane Sahel operation and pulling out of some bases in northern Mali.\n\nIts goal is to halve the contingent by the summer of 2023, but central to the plan is a French-led European force called Takuba that would shoulder some of the strain.\n\nUnder it, European allies are committing special forces to help train and fight alongside Malian units.\n\nBut Takuba has also hit problems with Mali.\n\nLast week, the junta demanded that Denmark withdraw its newly arrived contingent of some 90 soldiers, claiming it had deployed without authorisation \u2014 a charge Copenhagen denied.\n\nOn Twitter, Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said the ambassador\u2019s expulsion was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and his country \u201cstands in full solidarity with France.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch irresponsible behaviour is not what we expect from Mali, (which will (lose) international credibility,\u201d Kofod warned.\n\nFrance\u2019s army chief, General Pierre Schill, declined to comment on future French deployments.\n\n\u201cThe Sahel question is overwhelmingly political,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cToday, on a daily basis, our units are continuing their partnership with Malian battalions.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Human clinical trials have started for an experimental HIV vaccine that uses the same kind of mRNA technology found in Moderna\u2019s successful COVID-19 vaccine, the drug company has announced.\n\nThe company was quoted in a statement to have said the first vaccinations were given last Thursday, at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, DC.\n\nPhase I trials would also be run at the Hope Clinic of Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\n\nThe vaccine was designed to prompt white blood cells turn into antibodies that could neutralise HIV, it quoted ABC News to have reported. A booster shot to work with the HIV vaccine was also being studied.\n\n\u201cFor four decades, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has managed to dodge the immune system\u2019s attempts to destroy it.\n\n\u201cScientists have not been able to develop a vaccine, though they have made advancements in treatments, such as long-acting injectables for pre- and post-exposure prevention and treatment. HIV can lead to AIDS, which can be fatal,\u201d it added.\n\nThe release stated that 56 healthy HIV-negative adults took part in the clinical trial, with 48 getting one or two doses of the mRNA vaccine and 32 also getting the booster.\n\nEight people would just get the booster. All of them would be monitored for up to six months after receiving a final dose, it stated.\n\n\u201cThe immunogens \u2013 antigens that elicit an immune response \u2013 that are being tested were developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and Scripps Research. They will be delivered using the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology in Moderna\u2019s successful COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d it explained.\n\nAbout 1.2 million people in the United States had HIV at the end of 2019, according to the CDC, with more than 36,000 people being diagnosed in 2019.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says 37.7 million people in the world had HIV in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna\u2019s mRNA platform,\u201d MD, president and CEO of IAVI, Mark Feinberg, was quoted to have said.\n\n\u201cThe search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine.\u201d",
