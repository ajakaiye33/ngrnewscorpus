          "title": "Three ways you can pluralise \u2018news\u2019",
          "text": "The rate at which the word, \u2018news\u2019, is pluralised by some of us is baffling. Right from elementary schools, many teachers do not fail to stress that it is an uncountable noun. Yet, it is widely wrongfully pluralised.\n\nI know it would be unheard of for anyone to say \u2018newses\u2019, no matter how drunk or poor they might be at English. Not even our comedians, who might be guilty of inadvertently spreading bad expressions, have gone to this extent. The wrong pluralisation is, however, real.\n\nIt comes in the form of \u2018a news\u2019, \u2018many news\u2019, \u2018several news\u2019 etc. In other words, the culprits use elements meant for countable plural nouns with the word. While it is right to say many chairs and several chairs, it is inappropriate to say many news or several news. Similarly, it is unacceptable to say a news, one news, two news etc. So, the noun should be treated as other non-count/non-directly pluralised words such as furniture, equipment and information.\n\nPieces of\n\nWhen you feel you must establish the volume of the news you are referring to, you can use a piece or pieces of:\n\nA piece of news I read in \u2018The Punch\u2019 indicates that the progmame has been cancelled.\n\nTwo pieces of news I read in \u2018The Punch\u2019 and \u2018The Guardian\u2019 indicate that the programme has been cancelled.\n\nSome pieces of news I read indicate that the programme has been cancelled.\n\nMany pieces of news in the newspapers, magazines and online publications indicate that the programme has been cancelled.\n\nNote that while \u2018news\u2019 remains singular and uncountable, piece/pieces, which are countable, now determine the number of the verb. If it is \u2018news\u2019 alone, the singular verb (is, sounds, has been etc.) will accompany it. But \u2018a piece of\u2019 selects a singular verb while \u2018pieces of\u2019 selects the plural:\n\nThe piece of news is scary.\n\nThe pieces of news are scary.\n\nNews items\n\nIf you still want to dramatise the extent of the information, you can turn the term into an adjective, now qualifying another word, yet referring to news:\n\nThere is a news item in the story.\n\nThe news items have to be separated from the body of the report.\n\nSimilarly, we can employ \u2018report\u2019 itself to quantify \u2018news\u2019. It is understandable that \u2018report\u2019 can at times refer to \u2018news\u2019, meaning they can be synonyms, as in \u2018I read the news in \u2018The Punch\u2019 and \u2018I read the report in The Punch\u2019. Yet, there are occasions you can use \u2018report\u2019 to pluralise \u2018news\u2019:\n\nThe news report indicates that the programme has been cancelled.\n\nTwo news reports indicate that the programme has been cancelled.\n\nAnd what about much, some, a lot of?\n\nThese are also accepted with \u2018news\u2019, depending on the context:\n\nThere isn\u2019t much news in the story.\n\nMuch of the news is fake.\n\nA lot of news these days is not to be taken seriously.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Senate Committee on Communications on Monday held a public hearing on two bills.\n\nOne of the proposed legislation, among others, empowers the Nigerian Postal Service to collect stamp duty for the Federal Government.\n\nNIPOST and Federal Internal Revenue Service had been having issues over which of the government\u2019s agencies is constitutionally empowered to collect stamp duty in the country.\n\nThe bills are the Nigerian Postal Service Act (Repeal and Establishment) Bill, 2021; and the Nationwide Toll-Free Emergency number (Establishment) Bill, 2021.\n\nThe Post Master General of the Federation, Dr Ismail Adewusi, urged the National Assembly to expedite work on the bill, saying the present Act was obsolete and inadequate in view of the rapid developments and changes in the industry.\n\nHe said passing the bill into law would not only bring the country at par with other countries which had reformed their postal sectors, but also boost postal revenues of the government and encourage local and foreign investments in Nigeria\u2019s postal industry.\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, said that the National Toll-Free Emergency Bill presently before the National Assembly would establish a channel and put in place a structure to guarantee swift security response to Nigerians in times of emergencies.\n\nHe also said that the amendment of the Nigerian Postal Service Act would reposition the agency to provide efficient service delivery to Nigerians.\n\nThe Senate President said the bills when eventually passed and assented into law, would bring about significant improvement to the country\u2019s messaging systems.\n\nThe Chairman of the Senate Committee on Communication, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, said the Nigerian Postal Service Act (Repeal and Establishment) Bill, 2021, sought to unbundle the agency, whose responsibility would be the provision of universal postal services in Nigeria.\n\nShe disclosed that the bill made provision for the administration and planning of a national post code system in line with global standards for efficient mail delivery.\n\nThe sponsor of the bill, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, who was represented at the hearing by his colleague, Senator Tolu Odebiyi, said the bill when passed and signed into law would make 112 the emergency number of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

It is a new generation device because the components are of better and newer technologies than the DDCM.\n\n\u201cAs the time for the roll-out approaches, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, will update the nation on the modalities for the roll-out and the number of centres available to Nigerians.\u2019\u2019\n\nOkoye said that in compliance with section 10(2) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), INEC would adopt a hybrid method involving both in-person registration and online.\n\n\u201cNigerians who are not computer literate or who live in rural areas can start and finish their registration at any of the designated registration centres.\n\n\u201cThose with computers, tablets, or smartphones can start their registration online and complete their biometrics at any of the designated centres.\n\n\u201cThe online portal will have a registration area and polling unit locator that will assist registrants locate the registration area and polling unit nearest to them,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOkoye said that Yakubu would update Nigerians on the number of Voting Points and Voting Point Settlements converted to stand-alone and full-fledged polling units, and the total number of polling units in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cINEC has broken a 25-year-old jinx relating to the expansion of voter access to polling units, and Nigerians will have at their disposal new polling units.\n\n\u201cThe polling units will enable persons with disability, pregnant women and the elderly to access the units with less stress.\n\n\u201cSuch polling units will be easily accessible and user-friendly. It will make for physical distancing and will enable our ad hoc staff to carry out their constitutional and legal duties comfortably,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOkoye said that the voter registration was at the heart of the democratic process, as it would enable Nigerians who had attained the constitutional age for registration to register and exercise their democratic franchise.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Nigerians that meet the constitutional and legal threshold for registration will have the opportunity to register,\u2019\u2019 Okoye said.\n\nHe said that Yakubu, at his April 1, news conference, noted that the CRV was open to all Nigerians who were 18 years of age and have never been registered to vote.\n\nThe official said that the registration would also be opened to any registered voter, who had any issue during accreditation at previous elections, so that the agency could rectify such problems.\n\n\u201cAll registered voters who wish to transfer their voting locations from the present one to another; all registered voters who have lost their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) or whose PVCs have been defaced or damaged.\n\n\u201cAlso to all registered voters, who wish to correct their information such as misspellings of names, dates of birth etc,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Ibrahim SAN obtained by DAILY POST, it stated the position of the law as it pertains to obligations of a Bank to its customers, citing the case of Union Bank PLC vs N.M Okpara Chimaeze (2014) 9 NWLR (PT.1411) page 166 wherein Justice Ariwoola JSC. held that\n\nIt stated, \u201cIt is the duty of banker to its customer to honor and pay cheques drawn on it by the customer as long as it has in its possession at the material time sufficient and available funds for the purpose\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe barrister told the bank that a pending appeal does not operate as stay of execution, saying that anything done contrary to the lawful order of a court is an infrigement of the customers right.\n\nRecall that First Bank despite the order of Justice N.E Maha of the Federal High Court Abuja delivered on the 15th day of February 2021, vacating the interim restriction placed on the co-operatives\u2019 account by EFCC, has refused and or neglected to obey the order.\n\nRecall also that in February 26, 2009, the Federal Government through the National Council on Privatization had approved the sale of 10% of its equity shares in Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals ltd, Port Harcourt, Rivers State to the host community and interested staff of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals ltd.\n\nThe 10% equity shares was shared as 7.5% to the host community while the remaining 2.5% was allotted to the Staff of Indoroma Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\nInterested Staff came together under Eleme petrochemical co-operatives in compliance to the federal government directive that a special purpose vehicle be formed where all members will belong to enable them buy the shares.\n\nAccording to the letter, problem began in 2013 when 10 staffs who initially subscribed to the purchase of the 2.5 equity shares had their jobs terminated from the employment of Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals.\n\nIt explained that lndoroma Petrochemicals since then began a legal battle as to whether the laid off staff can continue to enjoy the dividends since they were not longer staff in the company and in so doing sought to replace the laid off staff with new recruited staff.\n\nIt noted that when the shareholding became an issue the laid of staff approached the River State Ministry of Commerce and Industry to arbitrate between it and the cooperative, the Ministry gave an Arbitral Award in favor of the laid off staff and consequently the laid off staffs of the co-operative, approached the federal high court to enforce the arbitral award as required by law. The award became a judgment of the Federal High Court.\n\nThe newly recruited staff been instigated by their employers Indoroma Eleme Petrochemicals Company limited approached The National Industrial court stating that the arbitral award was illegally procured ,when the right thing to do was to have appealed the Federal High Court judgement, the industrial court in striking the case out stated that it can not sit on an appeal over a matter that has been decided by a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction. The newly recruited staff thereafter filed an Appeal over the decision of the Industrial court.\n\nIt is to be noted that the EFCC started to investigate the ownership of the shares of the cooperative after the cases at the Federal high court and the Industrial Court had been decided.\n\nThe cases pending in various courts over the ownership of the shares of Indorama was triggered by the BPE which was a party sued in the case at the Industrial court, when it petitioned the EFCC over the matter at the instigation of the newly recruited staff of Indorama and Indorama itself.

That is why if there is any state the PDP is sure of winning any day any time in this country, I am sure you all know that it is Rivers State.\n\n\u201cThat is not the case of Niger state. You saw the reply of the former President to him. He is a rabble-rouser and a perpetual blackmailer. He is a chronic liar and a serial betrayer.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that Aliyu was among the party leaders, who opposed the emergence of Uche Secondus in 2017 as the Chairman of the PDP, adding that the former governor has now become a spokesman for Secondus-led National Working Committee because of his jobless condition.\n\nWike said while he had led the PDP to victory in many elections in Rivers despite federal might, Aliyu had serially lost all the elections PDP contested in his Niger State.\n\nHe said Aliyu lacked the capacity to lead the PDP to victory in Niger because of his alleged woeful performance in the state and challenged him to point at his legacy projects throughout the period he governed Niger.\n\nWike said Aliyu\u2019s dictatorial tendencies contributed in the waning fortunes of the PDP in Niger lamenting that the former governor\u2019s style had made it impossible for the PDP to hold party congresses in his state.\n\nThe Rivers Governor said Aliyu, despite his academic background misquoted his statement during the buildup to the election in Edo State when he said that some NWC members were tax collectors.\n\nWike said: \u201cI said some NWC members are tax collectors, I didn\u2019t say NWC members are tax collectors. I stand by my words.\u201d\n\nThe governor mocked Aliyu for suggesting that the PDP should have punished him for the \u201ctax collector\u201d statement saying he was available for either suspension or expulsion from the party.\n\nThe governor also debunked Aliyu\u2019s statement that he was fighting Secondus from Rivers adding that he had no problem with the National party chairman.\n\nHe, however, said that he would not stop speaking out whenever things were not going well in the party.\n\nWike said part of Aliyu\u2019s anger was that he refused to invite him to Rivers to inaugurate projects adding that the former governor was not qualified for such invitations because he had no concrete projects in Niger.",

You know senator has done a lot for the two countries. He understands China and also Chinese people. My predecessor introduced him to me, that he is not only a high ranking, very important, influential person in Nigeria, also, senator can do more for the two countries.\n\n\u201cAlso, I will like to share with you that I am the 14th Chinese ambassador to Nigeria and this year is very important for the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic ties between the two countries,\u201d Jianchun said.",

It is very difficult to identify which of the rivers is actually flowing into the other. That is, at our various border communities, there is no actual way of separating the peoples living in the two states of Lagos and Ogun.\n\n\u201cWhichever way we look at it, Ogun State has a larger percentage of the population over-spill into Lagos State as witnessed in many of our border communities in Ota/Ilete; Akute Alagboole; Lambe; Ojodu; Agbado; Mowe; Warewa; Isheri and, indeed, all the eight local government areas that share boundaries with Lagos State.\u201d",

We are more surprised that the head of the Nigerian police will make such an outrageous statement authorising state violence in a region that, for long, has been seething with anger at police brutality and extortion and a region whose youths have been extra-judicially killed by security agents in large numbers. Statements like those of the IGP further deepens the sense of victimisation by the state and therefore escalates the crisis.

Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.\u201d",

          "text": "Pledges to address problem of \u2018gun-wielding killer herdsmen\u2019\n\nUnlocks federal funding for take off of full actualization of modern grazing reserve system in consenting states in June\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe perennial clashes between the herders and farmers may soon become a thing of the past as President Muhammadu Buhari has approved ranching and revival of forest reserves across the country.\n\nThe plan of action include approved actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with specific requirements.\n\nThe President also picked on the Southern Governors and described their recent decision to ban open grazing as illegal saying it infringes on the constitutional right of Nigerians to move freely in any part of the country.\n\nSouthern governors had at their summit in Asaba recently banned open grazing in the region to end the frequent clashes between farmers and herders and called for restructuring of the country.\n\nThe President, in a release on Monday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed a strong resolve to address the conflicts of herders and farmers in a sustained and lasting manner that should lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between them, as well as the associated problem of the gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\nThe statement claimed the President had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, in a report he submitted and the President signed off on it back in April, \u201cwell before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power\u201d.\n\nThe statement said it was very clear that there was no solution offered from the Southern Governors resolutions to the herder-farmer clashes that had been continuing in the country for generations.\n\n\u201cBut the citizens of the southern states \u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari also contested the legality of the Southern Governors\u2019 ban on open grazing saying \u201cit is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the Constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) -regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\n\nThe release further said: \u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\nThe release said despite the COVID-19 pandemic that took a toll on public finances, the federal funding for the forest reserve project was ready and will take off in interested states by June.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both Federal and States. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June\u201d, the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Seriki Adinoyi\n\nUnknown gunmen on Sunday night killed 14 persons in two attacks on Dong and Kwi communities on the outskirts of Jos, the Plateau State capital.\n\nThe assailants reportedly invaded the Dong community and shot at the people sporadically, killing at least seven, including women and children.\n\nThe attack on Kwi took a similar pattern, leaving at least another seven dead and several others injured.\n\nSpokesman of Police Command in Plateau state, Mr. Gabriel Ogaba, confirmed the incident. He said, \u201cOn Sunday 23/05/2021 at about 2000hrs, the Command received a distress call that yet to be identified gunmen came out suddenly from a nearby bush, invaded Dong Village, Jos South LGA and killed seven persons.\n\n\u201cA combined team of Policemen, Special Task Force, Vigilante operatives led by a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Department of Operation, raced swiftly to the scene but the hoodlums had already fled back into the bush.\n\n\u201cInvestigation is ongoing, frantic effort is on to arrest the fleeing suspects. Meanwhile, Security has been beefed up in that area to prevent escalation of violence.\u201d\n\nThose killed in Dong community are Chiyena Oboche, Divine Oboche, Victoria Matthew, Praise Matthew, Danladi Matthew, Mr. Gospel, and Mr. Istifanus.\n\nLamenting the attacks, the Senator representing Plateau North in the National Assembly, Istifanus Gyang, said in a statement that it was disheartening that, \u201cShortly after the Inspector General of Police issued a security alert on likely terror attacks on Jos and the FCT, the blood merchants have visited terror on Dong community, adjacent Wild Life Park, Jos and Kwi village, adjacent Yakubu Gowon Airport Jos where a total of 14 persons were butchered to dead, including children.\u201d\n\nCondemning the attacks, the Senator revealed that \u201cavailable information indicates that some persons at a meeting with the Police the week preceding the attacks vowed to visit mayhem on helpless communities. It is therefore incumbent on the Plateau State Police Commissioner to arrest and prosecute those very persons forthwith.\u201d\n\nHe also called for decisive action against persons that are known to security agencies for the serial killings, displacemment and forceful occupation of ancestral homelands of communities in Plateau North.

          "text": "Former Minister of Education, Dr Oby Ezekwesili has said Nigeria cannot experience any economic development that will help the populace if there continues to be bad governance from the political class.\n\nShe disclosed that the monopolistic democracy of the country, which is not about the number of political parties but the dominant political culture of a few people belonging to the ruling class is detrimental to the poor masses.\n\nEzekwesili said this at a virtual conference she organised called #TheFixPolitics/Dialogue and focussed on a title, \u20181999 Constitution: To change or amend,\u2019 on Monday.\n\nThe ex-Vice President of the World Bank\u2019s Africa Region, while analysing the background of the FixPolitics, a non-governmental organisation she co-founded to address the anomaly of the Nigerian democratic nature, said there is a need to raise a new political class in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my studies, I realised there are key ideas between democracy and governance. And in our own case (in Nigeria) the absence of good governance is the greatest obstacle to Nigeria\u2019s economic development.\n\n\u201cThe economic development of this country among other things is affected by the monopolistic democracy. The monopolistic democracy is not about the number of political parties present, but the dominant political culture at play.\n\n\"There is an urgent need to raise a new order of political class. We have to mobilise people with the awareness of raising the matter of new constitution,\" Ezekwesili said.\n\nIn her address, a former Presidential candidate, Remi Sonaiya called for a new constitution for Nigeria. She clamoured for a platform that would involve the generality of the people in having a people-oriented constitution to replace the current 1999 Constitution of the country.\n\n\u201cThere have been submissions, but there is a constant call by the people, and that is a totally new constitution. There has to be a total, radical change to our constitution, not minor adding or subtracting but a total change,\u201d Sonaiya said.",

U. Buhari for the Appellant (FRN) and Ejieke Onuoha (for Ozekhome), held that there was uncontradicted evidence shown in invoices and receipts issued by Ozekhome to Fayose that the said sum represented part payment of his professional fees in the handling of various cases for Fayose across Nigeria.\n\nIn 2016, the EFCC had, through Justice I.B.M Idris, then of the Federal High Court, Lagos, frozen Governor Fayose's accounts, accusing him of allegedly keeping proceed of unlawful activity.\n\nFayose immediately engaged Ozekhome's legal services and he approached the Federal High Court, Ado-Ekiti, presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo, and challenged the ex parte freezing order granted by Justice Idris.\n\nA judgement delivered by Justice Taiwo Taiwo had found that the freezing order had been improperly granted and without jurisdiction in the first place, and upon suppression of material facts.\n\nFayose after the judgement went to his bank and withdrew N5 million from his unfrozen account for himself, while transferring N75 million to Ozekhome, as part payment of his professional fees.\n\nThe EFCC, though appealed this judgement, still went ahead and froze Ozekhome's account, contending that the N75 million paid to his chambers by Fayose as professional fees for legal services, was a proceed of unlawful activity.\n\nOzekhome filed a motion before the Federal High Court, Lagos, urging it to set aside its earlier order freezing his chambers\u2019 account.\n\nHe alleged misrepresentation, non-disclosure, suppression of material facts and non-compliance with the rules of the lower court and Judicial authorities regulating the grant of ex parte applications by the Appellant.\n\nJustice Anka after hearing arguments from Ozekhome and Rotimi Oyedepo for the EFCC vacated the ex parte order and unfroze his account with GTBank.

          "text": "Ethiopia has awarded one out of the two private telco licences it intends to award to a consortium that includes the Vodafone group. The consortium, which made a winning bid of $850 million, comprises Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc and Sumitomo Corp.\n\nThe licence award is a big step for Ethiopia as it marks the opening of its telecom sector to foreign investors. For years, the state-owned Ethiotel has held a monopoly but will now have competition.\n\nBeyond competition, it will have a significant economic impact, considering that the consortium will create 1.1 million jobs and invest $8.5 billion in the next ten years. According to a tweet by the country\u2019s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, \u201cit will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date.\u201d\n\nThe country also announced that it would not grant a second telecoms licence after rejecting a second bid from MTN.\n\nMTN\u2019s bid is not good enough\n\nThe prospect of a market with 112 million people is as good as it gets for many telcos, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that all the big names initially planned to make bids. Etisalat, Orange Telecoms, MTN and Saudi Telecom Company were some of the companies that registered interest.\n\nIn the end, only two companies put bids forward; the Vodafone consortium and MTN. Safaricom, one of the consortium companies, had announced prematurely in March that it had won the bid.\n\nRegardless, MTN also made a bid of $600 million which was considered not good enough, and now the second telecoms licence will now be retendered for new offers.\n\nOne interesting point is that MTN\u2019s bid was financed in part by a Chinese investor, while a newly created US foreign-aid agency backed the Vodafone consortium\u2019s bid. It is a continuation of what some observers call a competition on the tech front in Africa.\n\nA similar situation played out in Kenya as Safaricom rolled out its 5G service initially with Huawei providing support. The US reportedly had concerns with the decision to use Huawei, in line with a strategy of using its diplomatic might to dissuade African governments from buying into the technology solutions from the Chinese company.\n\nIn the end, Safaricom stuck with Huawei but also included the Finnish company, Nokia. Despite this, it is clear that this is not the last we\u2019ll see of the continuing competition between the US and China in Africa\u2019s tech space.",

          "title": "Successful product managers are walking encyclopedias.",
          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of the people building brilliant products and services in Africa.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Tobi Lufadeju to Centre Stage because I admire how determined she is to succeed in her role and how invested she is in her personal and professional development. Even when she has moments where she feels like a small fish in a big sea, she doesn\u2019t allow her youthful insecurities to slow her down or get in the way of her responsibilities.\n\nTwo weeks after my meeting with Feranmi, I\u2019m back at Eric Keyser to meet with a very nervous but confident Tobi Lufadeju who is a young product manager at Reliance HMO.\n\nWhat were you doing in your early 20s? When I was Tobi\u2019s age, I was wrapping up my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in English literature and overthinking my future and career path.\n\nAt Reliance, Tobi is in charge of the consumer business unit.\n\n\u201cThe consumer business unit is basically the retail side of the business. But I don\u2019t just handle retail products \u2013 I also handle products for SMEs and our partners.\u201d\n\nCuriousity is a product manager\u2019s super power\n\nTobi describes herself as a curious person, so I had to ask how curiosity plays a role in her work:\n\n\u201cProduct management is the intersection of business, technology and design. Successful product managers need to learn a little bit about each of them because we do a lot of directing in our work. In my role, I have an overview of what everyone is working on \u2013 from the frontend engineers to the DevOps team.\u201d\n\nWhen Tobi uses the word \u2018directing\u2019, I immediately picture a sharp-minded captain steering a large ship in open waters. The captain is responsible for not only the ship but her diverse team of crew members and cabin hands. Should aspiring product managers expect to manage diverse teams? This is what Tobi had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, they absolutely should have that expectation. As the product manager, you are the product\u2019s encyclopedia; so if the head of marketing needs information about the product, you have to know enough to give an appropriate answer. Being a curious person helps me learn as much as I possibly can about what we are building.\u201d\n\nWhen you picture product managers, what do you see them doing? Crunching numbers? Creating colourless spreadsheets? Tracking the lifespan of a product? Counting app downloads? What does their day-to-day work life look like for Tobi?\n\n\u201cI prioritize the work we are doing at all times and carve out time to do the work. I collaborate with different people and communicate our products\u2019 progress reports so everyone on the team knows what they need to do. I also make out time to speak to my direct supervisor \u2013 the business lead \u2013 and realign myself with our goals and plans for the quarter.\u201d\n\nWinning the battle over Impostor Syndrome\n\nProduct managers not only have to speak their product\u2019s language, but they also have to speak their team\u2019s language. How then do successful product managers navigate team management?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common myth that product managers are micromanagers; this isn\u2019t the case with me,\u201d Tobi said in-between bites of her chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cAlthough I operate as a kind of middle man, I don\u2019t meddle with the work. I trust my team to do what they are skilled at and leave them to run on their own. I also remember to connect with them as human beings. Yeah, I have to meet my deliverables but I have to support my team as well.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 64 million young people aged between 15 \u2013 35 years old living in Nigeria. It\u2019s obvious that our youth population is increasing rapidly with no plans of slowing down. But how prepared are they to enter local and global workplaces? How do young managers deal with issues such as impostor syndrome?\n\n\u201cThe first two months on the job were not easy. I joined an existing team which meant that I had to do a lot of learning and observation in the beginning. My team members would throw around in-house language during meetings and I also had to figure out how to speak the engineering team\u2019s language. I dealt with impostor syndrome big time.\u201d\n\nWhen you get hired by a new company, you have to make your first 100 days count. But being the newbie hire can be a daunting experience. How can new employees quieten the insecure voices in their heads and trust their abilities and skills?\n\n\u201cEven though the learning curve was steep in the beginning, I had to figure it out. I couldn\u2019t afford to fail because that\u2019s my name on the line. So whenever I felt confused after a meeting, I would call one of my team members back and ask questions. I still have moments where I\u2019m confused about certain things but I\u2019ve been given the leeway to experiment and try different tactics.\u201d\n\nCentre Stage tip: When in doubt or confused, ask questions.\n\nTips and tricks for aspiring and existing product managers\n\nEarlier in our conversation, Tobi mentions how important it is to be curious on the job. I asked her what other skills she believes aspiring product managers need to be excellent in their roles?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with effective communication. You can\u2019t just tell people what to do, you have to help them understand what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and who needs to do it. If you cannot communicate clearly, you will not get the results you desire.\n\nPrioritisation is the second skill. Successful product managers must own the product and visualize the bigger picture at all times. When you have the bigger picture in your mind, it\u2019s easier to assign priority levels to different tasks.\n\nFinally, you need interpersonal skills. Although my team members don\u2019t directly report to me, I still have to learn how to speak to them with respect and empathy. When we have long weeks, I ensure I check in on the engineers because, at the end of the day, we are humans and need breaks from time to time.\n\nProduct managers need to learn how to give praise and encouragement, especially when they notice their team members are stressed or when their energy tanks are empty.\u201d\n\nTobi\u2019s role at Reliance HMO is her first stab at being a product manager. In addition to learning on the job, she\u2019s also had to invest her personal time in picking up new knowledge about her responsibilities and that of her team. So, what is she doing to improve her skills?\n\n\u201cPractice. I consciously track what I\u2019m doing and how I\u2019m doing my work. I make out time to reflect on my progress regularly. I follow product leaders and managers on LinkedIn\u2013 I read their articles and make note of the tips they share. I also use Blinkst to read books at an accelerated pace. At one point, I had access to Masterclass, I took some business and product-focused courses. My business lead also sends me resources like podcasts and articles.\u201d\n\nWhere your professional career is concerned, one thing you never stop doing is learning. Tobi is ambitious about being successful in her role and isn\u2019t afraid to do what it takes to achieve her definition of success. My key takeaway from my conversation with Tobi is that managers, no matter how young or experienced they are, must be courageous, curious, and competent.\n\n\u201cIf I had to share any tip with aspiring product managers, I would recommend researching what goes into being a product manager and taking one or two courses about what tools you need to use and what to do on the job. If you are on social media, follow conversational product leaders and engage with them on Twitter or LinkedIn. There\u2019s a lot to learn at once and the work hit me like a wrecking ball in the beginning.\n\nMeasure as objectively as you can. You cannot fit everything into an OKR or KPI framework. Sometimes, you have to use your intuition to measure yourself and how well you are succeeding as a manager and team member. How are you handling your team? Are you driven by impact or are you working for the sake of it? If you are focused on making an impact, you will always deliver value to the business.\u201d",

          "title": "New FirstBank Website Puts YOU, the customer, First!",
          "text": "Banking has evolved over the years and the industry now abundantly relies on web-based applications for providing services to customers. With more and more people increasingly glued to connected devices, banks that hope to compete in today\u2019s market must focus on digital channels.\n\nOne of the pillars of a digital strategy is having a website that serves as the face of a company on the internet and its first virtual touchpoint. But in the digital age, just rolling out a website with a visual style and design stuck in the 90s does not cut it. Consumers have high expectations when it comes to online experience, so banks must find a way to offer the best digital experience possible. Hence the importance of having a unique site with world-class design and functionality.\n\nIf there\u2019s any bank that understands this so well, it\u2019s First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the West African premier financial inclusion services provider. Established over a century127 years ago, FirstBank continues to evolve, successfully adopting the latest technology and embracing innovation in delivering seamless banking solutions to its customers across the world. The bank recently launched a newly-designed corporate website that fits right in with its quest to be Africa\u2019s bank of first choice \u2013 even when it comes to banking on digital channels.\n\nFrom online banking, loan calculator to customer support, here are some standout features of the new FirstBank website:\n\nDesigned for Banking on the Go\n\nThe new FirstBank website has a simple yet striking and modern design in a fresh, magazine-style look that promotes access to essential information for its customers, FirstMonie agents, prospective agents and the public.\n\nThe site leverages the bank\u2019s brand colors to attract attention to certain areas. FirstBank uses its blue color on the call-to-action buttons, with the backdrop remaining mostly gold. This makes them stand out from the other menu items and brings user attention to where it matters most without overwhelming visitors.\n\nMore importantly, the website is designed from a mobile-first standpoint, which is responsive, considering increased usage of mobile devices compared to desktop computers. With this design, the FirstBank website reformats to fit the screen of whatever device the visitor is using to view it and allows users the flexibility to conduct business wherever they may be.\n\nIntuitive site navigation\n\nWhen people visit their institution\u2019s website, it is not because they are looking for somewhere to spend their extra time. They are often seeking help and want to get to things quickly. FirstBank offers a wide array of financial services for a varied customer base, which can make it difficult to maintain a clean and easily navigated website. But the new platform \u2013 with a simple and clearly labeled navigation \u2013 allows users and potential customers to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for quickly and easily.\n\nOne of the core strengths of the new website is prominent links to top pages. The homepage begins with a prominent header that displays clear visual and clickable options that direct users to the main categories of Personal Banking, Business Banking & Private Banking and features a clear link to FirstBank\u2019s Contact/Customer Service page with alternate ways for visitors to seek help, such as email and phone.\n\nMoving down the homepage provides visitors with easy navigation for common prospect needs, represented with icons and calls to action. On the new website, these include Open Account, Agency Banking, Find a Branch, Loan Calculator, etc. The intuitive and user-friendly upgrade guides customers to make well-informed decisions about their financial needs, whatever they are.\n\nEasy Access to Online Banking\n\nIn the digital age, a bank is less likely to be considered by younger generations if it does not have online banking. And for banks that do offer online banking, they have to make it easy for consumers to find and use. On its new website, FirstBank puts an obvious button to online banking in top navigation so visitors know exactly where to go. The \u2018Online Banking\u2019 login/enrollment call-to-action is placed at the top of every page, easing the digital experience for existing customers.\n\nSeparate Product Pages with Strong Calls-to-Action\n\nThe FirstBank website has unique secondary pages for every product, and clear calls-to-action for people to be able to navigate to those pages. Across all pages, the main image rotates displaying a variety of themes in line with the banking category and each contains easy-to-navigate dropdown menus, with a simple, straightforward, and detailed breakdown of the bank\u2019s products by the problem that they solve for individuals and businesses. From the product pages, a visitor can easily know how to get or sign up for the product or service they are interested in.\n\nOnline Account Opening\n\nA bank can\u2019t be open all day, but its website can be. Knowing that some potential customers do not live by its operating hours, FirstBank offers banking on their terms through the website.\n\nA standout feature of the new website is that it enables online applications and the ability to submit personal information securely. That makes it easy for interested visitors to open an account, offering a clear start to their banking journey.\n\nTools and Content that Empower Customers\n\nEvery user experience begins with a goal in mind and the new FirstBank website empowers its customers by providing a wide array of financial information and tools that meet customers needs, whatever they are. Among many actions, users can perform various transactions \u2013 make payments, transfer money, manage accounts, buy airtime, calculate loan rates and virtually interact with the bank \u2013 without stepping out of their comfort zone.\n\nThe site also serves as a library to keep customers abreast of various financial services solutions and offers intriguing content that is relevant to FirstBank\u2019s varied customer base \u2013 such as how-to guides that educate consumers on better managing their money and making the best financial decisions, thereby helping them to improve their economic and social wellbeing, as well as unique blog articles/insights on enterprise scaling, global trade and navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, targeted at corporate clients.\n\nLocation Finder\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the new FirstBank website is its Location Finder, where visitors can browse locations of the bank\u2019s branches and Firstmonie Agents. The feature allows users to search based on their radius or address and helps them find the FirstBank branch that\u2019s closest to them and best fits their needs. The branch locator is interactive and integrated with Google Maps API, which makes it easier for the visitor to browse the locations.\n\nOverall, FirstBank gets it right when it comes to usability, understanding its customers\u2019 needs and expectations, and website navigation behavior while creating a beautiful site that employs some of the latest trends in responsive web design, with exceptional user experience and a perfect mix of exciting features.\n\nWith the new FirstBank website, customers are at an edge in the industry as they establish a relationship with the Bank that puts YOU, its customers, First.\n\nYou can visit the new FirstBank website here.",

          "text": "14th May, 2021 \u2013 Lumos, Africa\u2019s leading solar home system provider in conjunction with Modion Communications, a fast-rising PR Agency in Africa, has won the Sabre Award for 2021 for its social PR campaign supporting indigent schoolgirl Fathia Dele Rasheed, from Ondo State, Southwest, Nigeria in February 2020. The African Sabre Award is the continent\u2019s biggest prize for superior achievement in Public Relations and Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nAs part of the campaign, Lumos Nigeria tracked Dele after a picture of her doing her homework at night with illumination from an ATM facility surfaced on social media. The company installed a free Solar Home System (SHS) in Dele\u2019s home within 48 hours after the social media reveal, enabling constant access to electricity for her and her family, using Lumos\u2019 SHS. The family joins over 100,000 household and small businesses in Nigeria already connected to Lumos.\n\nThe Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) intervention campaign tagged \u2018Touching Lives Through A Determined School Child \u2013 Dele Fathia\u2019 was adjudged as the overall best social campaign in Africa by the Sabre Awards jury, beating other top nominees from leading brands and companies in Kenya, Mauritius, and Uganda.\n\nCommenting on the recognition, the CEO of Lumos Nigeria, Mrs. Adepeju Adebajo, said; \u201cWhen we saw the desire and determination of Dele Fathia to learn even in the face of difficulties and limitation of power supply, we concluded that it was critical for us to take action by providing our easy-to-install solar home system, allowing her and the family to enjoy the endless possibilities that come with constant power supply,\u201d Mrs. Adebajo said.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see that the campaign has inspired renewed awareness on the adoption of solar power as an affordable alternative to the perennial power supply deficit in Nigeria. We are pleased that this solution has now gone mainstream, with Nigeria\u2019s government committed to providing 5 million Solar Home Systems to 25 million households as part of the country\u2019s quick-win strategy to deliver electricity to more families.\n\n\u201cWe believe everyone has the right to a better quality of life offered by access to clean, affordable and reliable power. Lumos remains committed to powering one home, one business, one community at a time. It is also pleasing to see that we have inspired other players in the ecosystem, who are now willing to provide similar initiatives to indigent families in communities where power supply from the grid is either inadequate or available,\u201d she added.\n\nAt the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Lumos, in collaboration with All-On, installed solar powered systems in isolation centres across the country as well as the installation of Solar home systems to over 147 primary health centers across Nigeria. This was in addition to installing its solar systems at Primary Health Centres across 20 Local Governments in Lagos State to help improve quality healthcare delivery to grassroots communities.\n\nABOUT LUMOS\n\nLumos is a market-leading provider of high-quality solar home systems in Africa, designed to make reliable and clean power accessible to everyone. We combine easy to use technology with personalised service to power prosperity for millions of people. For more information, visit www.lumos.com.ng.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Nigerian API fintech startup, Mono, has closed $2 million in seed investment to charge the African Internet economy, after announcing its acceptance into Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2021 batch in February.\n\nRecall that in September 2020, the startup raised $500k pre-seed with plans to build Plaid for Africa.\n\nThe $2 million round was raised by Kuda Co-founder and CEO, Babs Ogundeyi; Gbenga Oyebode, partner at TCVP; Eric Idiahi, Co-founder and Partner at Verod Capital, Lateral Capital; and Entr\u00e9e Capital \u2014 an investor in Kuda\u2019s seed round.\n\nMono organises different financial data in a single API for firms and third-party developers. It allows easy retrieval of information like income, account statements, real-time balance, and historical transactions. It also attempts to improve financial inclusion and connectivity in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe API startup claims to have secured partnerships with over 16 financial institutions in Nigeria. And so far, it has reportedly connected over 100,000 financial accounts for its partners and analysed over 66 million financial transactions.\n\nThe money raised would be used to strengthen its current financial and identity data offerings, and launch new products for diverse business verticals.\n\nThe funds would also be used for its expansion into Kenya and Ghana. As reported by TechCrunch, Mono will be launched in Ghana in June 2021.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Abdul Hassan, said their expansion was inspired by their customers looking to expand to other markets. They work with their customers to give them the right tools to develop new experiences for their customers.\n\nData companies help businesses analyse acquired data and use them as required, and Abdul Hassan emphasised that Mono is focused on data and not open banking. Hence, Prakhar Singh, Mono Co-founder, expressed their intention to power the Internet economy with data unrelated to finances.\n\nThe CEO said that the fintech startup would ultimately diversify to become a data company. Therefore, it is taking things one product at a time.\n\nThough the startup envisions becoming a data company, connecting with payment gateways and other fintech management startups, Hassan thinks though it comes with a lot of issues, connecting to the systems is possible.\n\nTherefore, he believes that connecting to all available data and opening it up for businesses and developers is the first step to diversification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith its diversification plan, Mono would be powering the Internet economy and setting the mark for other API fintech startups in Africa. But only time would tell how soon that would happen.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Techcrunch\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode! Listen to Built in Africa\n\nComments",

And don\u2019t underestimate the possibility of being found out when carrying out sensitive duties.\u201d\n\nHe urged journalists to always get the highest standard of protective equipment.\n\nAccording to Fisayo, careful collaboration with trusted source is key in investigative journalism and urged participants to always create an exit strategy before embarking on sensitive assignments.\n\n\u201cNo big investigation can be done alone. You need fixers, information, perspectives that can only be possible when you interact with people. And they can make or mar you and your investigations. So, trust people in circumspect,\u201d Soyombo warned.\n\nHe cautioned journalists to always seek professional advise especially during pandemics so as to protect themselves , family and people around them.\n\nHe urged participants to read and write as often as possible and count the cost and be ready to pay the prize for the outcome of their investigation but however warned that no investigation was worth their lives.\n\nOther speakers at the training included Dr. Uzo Israel, Clinical Psychologist at the Department of Psychology, University of Lagos (UNILAG), who spoke on \u201cthe topic \u201cManaging Stress , Trauma And Other Psychological /Mental Health Challenges In The Coverage Of Pandemics And Crisis Situations\u201d , who said, both water and relaxation therapies were best tools for managing stress adding that they were cheap and without any side effects.\n\nDr. Israel, advised the participants to maintain healthy nutrition, relaxation , regular exercise (tailored to suit individuals) and sleep patterns especially when under pressure to meet deadlines; she added that trauma experienced during reporting has a tendency to overwhelm journalists\u2019 ability to cope with work and life.\n\nAccording to her, COVID-19 has challenged existing models of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which are by-products of past events, adding that research has shown that people now exhibit stress symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and urged participants to always have positive attitude about life.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Cutrupi Gillo, of IFEX, while speaking on the topic \u201cSafety Reporting Challenges Offline and Online\u201d, reminded journalists that security of their devices and optimal confidentiality is key to safe practice of the profession.\n\nMr. Gillo , a security expert, emphasized the need to ensure that devices as well as apps are locked while introducing new softwares that are safer for Information storage apart from the regular ones and urged participants to always conduct regular checklists and also secure their electronic mails for future purposes.\n\nHe warned journalists against visiting unknown and unverified websites that could compromise their devices and data.\n\nThe Executuve Director of International Press Centre (IPC), Mr. Lanre Ogundade while welcoming participants to the training, said that, the training was one of the components of a project on \u2018Enhanced Safety Awareness for Nigeria Journalists\u2019 being implemented by IPC with the support of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of organisations that promote and defend the right to freedom of expression and information.\n\nHe explained that IFEX also supports the building of appropriate capacities for journalists including safety in investigative reporting, digital security and management of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nMr. Arogundade highlighted that the training was expected to enhance the reporters capacity to manage difficult safety challenges while carrying out their assignments.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has decried repeated attacks on its offices in different states, especially in Southeast, describing it as a national emergency.\n\nINEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, who said this in a statement after an emergency session today, hours after its office in Igboeze South Local Government Area of Enugu State was razed, regretted that attacks on its offices have continued unabated.\n\n\u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) met in emergency session today, Monday 24th May 2021, as attacks on its facilities in some states of the Federation continue unabated,\u201d Okoye said.\n\n\u201cIn the latest incidents, three offices of the Commission came under attack in Anambra, Imo and Enugu States. The Resident Electoral Commissioners (REC) for Anambra State, Dr. Nkwachukwu Orji; his Imo State counterpart, Professor Francis Ezeonu, and that of Enugu State, Emeka Ononamadu, have reported that the attacks took place at various times on the night of Sunday, 23rd May 2021.\u201d\n\nThe electoral body said attack on its headquarters in Anambra State is a major blow to the preparation for the governorship election scheduled for November 6 in the state.\n\n\u201cThe State Headquarters office in Awka was set ablaze in the most devastating onslaught on the Commission\u2019s facilities so far.\n\n\u201cThe attackers were systematic and selective in their targets. The Pavillion which serves as Collation Centre during major elections was burnt down. In what is a major blow to our preparations for the Governorship election scheduled for 6th November 2021, two stores housing electoral materials were burnt down,\u201d the statement noted.\n\n\u201cNew and old (but serviceable) electric generating machines numbering 376 for all the Electoral Wards and the extra numbers for backup were completely burnt. The electric generators were recently relocated from the Local Government Area (LGAS) to the HQ in the belief that it is more secure than the LGA offices.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, as part of the Commission\u2019s proactive measures to ensure the success of the Governorship election later this year, about 50% of the non-sensitive materials required for the November 6, 20201 Governorship election already delivered to the State have also been lost in the fire. In addition, seven utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux) were burnt.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that following the fire incident on the eve of the 2019 General Election in which the Smart Card Readers for the State were destroyed, the Commission moved the replacement Smart Card Readers from the shipping containers to the concrete store for enhanced protection. Fortunately, the Smart Card Readers were not affected.\n\n\u201cAlso yesterday, our office in Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area was attacked at about 6.45pm in an obvious attempt to set the building ablaze. Fortunately, the damage was limited to a section of the building, specifically the windows and part of the roof. No electoral materials or office equipment were destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt about 1.00pm yesterday, our Igboeze South LGA office was attacked. The store was completely burnt down before the Neighborhood Watch and the Enugu State Fire Service responded and prevented the inferno from razing other parts of the building.\n\n\u201cThis is the third attack on INEC facilities in the State in less than two weeks following the destruction of our Udenu LGA office on 13th May 2021 and the State Headquarters building in Enugu on 16th May 2021.\n\n\u201cAll three incidents in Anambra, Imo and Enugu have been reported to the Police for investigation.\n\n\u201cAlthough no lives were lost, these are clearly orchestrated and targeted attacks aimed at incapacitating the Commission in conducting electoral activities, especially in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on the Commission\u2019s facilities have now become a national emergency. Accordingly, the Commission will brief the Government and stakeholders on these incidents.\n\n\u201cIn spite of these setbacks, the Commission is determined to continue to discharge its responsibilities including the conduct of the scheduled Anambra Governorship election,\u201d the statement concluded.",

Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.\u201d",

The NPA initiated a public procurement process in line with the Public Procurement Act (PPA) to engage a service provider. INTELS bidded but got disqualified for falling short of the criteria spelt out in the advert. NPA concluded the procurement process and submitted the documents to the minister for onward submission to FEC in November 2020,\u2019\u2019said the source.\n\nAlso, a source in the marine and operations department of NPA told LEADERSHIP on Sunday that the non-submission of the concluded tender process for FEC consideration has left a vacuum from the period of August 2020 to May 2021 and allowed for huge revenues loss running into over $50million uncollected as NPA doesn\u2019t have the equipment and skills to monitor the service boats movement.\n\nThe suspended managing director of NPA, Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman, had said recently that INTELS was disqualified because it violated one of the criteria advertised for the tender process.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the relationship between NPA and INTELS, a senior NPA official revealed on Sunday that the NPA currently has eight contractual relationships and a policy provision with INTELS. He said the policy provision and the expired service boat monitoring contract are the key issues. The policy provision, he stated, is the removal of the oil and gas terminal which was done in 2018.\n\nDocuments seen revealed that Shell had promised to save the federal government a whopping $1 billion if it is allowed an oil and gas logistics base in Lagos.\n\nHowever, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has asked the administrative panel of Inquiry set up to investigate the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to examine and investigate issues leading to the termination of pilotage contract handled by INTELS.\n\nWhile inaugurating the administrative panel approved by President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the activities of the suspended MD of NPA, Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman recently, the Minister said the term of reference included the examination and investigation of issues leading to the termination of pilotage and other contracts of Nigerian Ports Authority and confirm compliance with the terms of the respective contracts, court rulings and presidential directives.",

The calendar we have set for ourselves is that we are going to have a vote on each of the bills before we proceed on the long recess in July.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that we have enough resources. We are not in any way hampered by finances. Before we proceed on July recess, you can take it to the bank that we will take the votes. The schedule is tight but once we conclude the national public hearing on June 3rd and 4th of June, we will go into a retreat to consider the report and do clause-by-clause consideration on each of the bills.

The Pavillion which serves as Collation Centre during major elections was burnt down. In what is a major blow to our preparations for the Governorship election scheduled for 6th November 2021, two stores housing electoral materials were burnt down.\n\n\u201cNew and old (but serviceable) electric generating machines numbering 376 for all the Electoral Wards and the extra numbers for backup were completely burnt. The electric generators were recently relocated from the Local Government Areas (LGAs) to the State HQ in the belief that it is more secure than the LGA offices.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, as part of the Commission\u2019s proactive measures to ensure the success of the Governorship election later this year, about 50% of the non-sensitive materials required for the November 6, 20201 Governorship election already delivered to the State have also been lost in the fire. In addition, seven utility vehicles (Toyota Hilux) were burnt.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that following the fire incident on the eve of the 2019 General Election in which the Smart Card Readers for the State were destroyed, the Commission moved the replacement Smart Card Readers from the shipping containers to the concrete store for enhanced protection. Fortunately, the Smart Card Readers were not affected.\n\n\u201cAlso yesterday, our office in Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area was attacked at about 6.45pm in an obvious attempt to set the building ablaze. Fortunately, the damage was limited to a section of the building, specifically the windows and part of the roof. No electoral materials or office equipment were destroyed.\n\n\u201cAt about 1.00pm yesterday, our Igboeze South LGA office was attacked. The store was completely burnt down before the Neighborhood Watch and the Enugu State Fire Service responded and prevented the inferno from razing other parts of the building.\n\n\u201cThis is the third attack on INEC facilities in the State in less than two weeks following the destruction of our Udenu LGA office on 13th May 2021 and the State Headquarters building in Enugu on 16th May 2021\u201d.\n\nHe disclosed that all three incidents in Anambra, Imo and Enugu have been reported to the police for investigation.\n\n\u201cAlthough no lives were lost, these are clearly orchestrated and targeted attacks aimed at incapacitating the Commission in conducting electoral activities, especially in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIn spite of these setbacks, the Commission is determined to continue to discharge its responsibilities including the conduct of the scheduled Anambra Governorship election\u201d, he said..",

It is a new generation device because the components are of better and newer technologies than the DDCM.\n\n\u201cAs the time for the roll-out approaches, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, will update the nation on the modalities for the roll-out and the number of centres available to Nigerians.\u2019\u2019\n\nOkoye said that in compliance with section 10(2) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), INEC would adopt a hybrid method involving both in person registration and online.\n\n\u201cNigerians who are not computer literate or who live in rural areas can start and finish their registration at any of the designated registration centres.\n\n\u201cThose with computers, tablets or smart phones can start their registration online and complete their biometrics at any of the designated centres.\n\n\u201cThe online portal will have a registration area and polling unit locator that will assist registrants locate the registration area and polling unit nearest to them,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOkoye said that Yakubu would update Nigerians on the number of Voting Points and Voting Point Settlements converted to stand alone and full-fledged polling units, and the total number of polling units in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cINEC has broken a 25-year-old jinx relating to the expansion of voter access to polling units, and Nigerians will have at their disposal new polling units.\n\n\u201cThe polling units will enable persons with disability, pregnant women and the elderly to access the units with less stress.\n\n\u201cSuch polling units will be easily accessible and user-friendly. It will make for physical distancing and will enable our ad hoc staff to carry out their constitutional and legal duties comfortably,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOkoye said that the voter registration was at the heart of the democratic process, as it would enable Nigerians who had attained the constitutional age for registration to register and exercise their democratic franchise.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Nigerians that meet the constitutional and legal threshold for registration will have the opportunity to register,\u2019\u2019 Okoye said.\n\nHe said that Yakubu, at his April 1, news conference, noted that the CRV was open to all Nigerians who were 18 years of age and have never been registered to vote.\n\nThe official said that the registration would also be opened to any registered voter, who had any issue during accreditation at previous elections, so that the agency could rectify such problems.\n\n\u201cAll registered voters who wish to transfer their voting locations from the present one to another; all registered voters who have lost their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) or whose PVCs have been defaced or damaged.\n\n\u201cAlso to all registered voters, who wish to correct their information such as misspellings of names, dates of birth etc,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "The prohibition on open grazing enacted by the Southern Governors has been chastised by the White House. The Southern Governors allegedly attempted to impose a moratorium on open grazing to display their dominance, according to the report.\n\nOn Monday, Garba Shehu, a senior special assistant to the President on media and publicity, issued a statement to that effect. President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr Shehu said, has indicated a strong commitment to resolving herder conflicts, as well as the problem of gun-wielding \u201ckilling herdsmen.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cPresident had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture, in a report he submitted and the President signed off on back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum, which attempted to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is apparent that their resolutions did not provide a solution to the herder-farmer conflicts that have raged in our nation for generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, inhabitants of the southern states \u2013 indeed, people of all Nigerian states \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find solutions to governance and human rights concerns, rather than to wash their hands of difficult decisions by issuing prohibitions that declare, \u201cNot in my state.\u201d\n\nMr Shehu further stated that their announcement is problematic in legal terms.\n\nHe underlined the constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms in each of our 36 states (and the Federal Capital Territory), regardless of where they were born or live.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever purpose it is intended, and Mr. President, who has rightly been concerned about these issues more than any other citizen, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, beginning with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant, in consultation with farmers and herders alike.\n\nWith veterinary clinics, animal watering stations, and schools for herders and their families, the Federal Government is bringing far-reaching and practical changes to these rehabilitated areas, allowing various populations to coexist side by side: assisting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their cattle, and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the financial hardship the COVID-19 pandemic has had on both the federal and state governments. Nonetheless, given the critical need to solve the persistent problems, federal financing for the long-delayed project is now being partially freed. In a few of the agreeing states, work on fully implementing the current reserve system should begin in June.\u201d\n\nNEWS DIRECT recalls that seventeen governors from the country\u2019s southern area gathered in Asaba, Delta state, two weeks ago.\n\nA ban on open-grazing of cattle and the need for ranching are among the state governors\u2019 resolutions. The Governors also discussed the urgent necessity for reorganization in order to achieve parity with other areas.\n\nHowever, the meeting\u2019s statement has sparked arguments about whether the restriction is lawful or not.",

          "text": "About one hundred persons have been reportedly killed within three days in a sustained attack by gunmen suspected to be herders in four wards of Katsina Ala local government area of Benue state.\n\nThe attack, which started Saturday, Blueprint learnt, had continued through Sunday till Monday.\n\nThe council Chairman, Alfred Atera, said many people in the area were moving out of their communities over the attack which had already claimed the lives of about one hundred persons.\n\nHe said four council wards were under attack by the Fulani marauders, including Yoyo, Utange, Mbatyula/Mberev and Mbayongo.\n\n\u201cFour council wards are being attacked by the herdsmen in Katsina Ala local government area and they include, Yooyo, Utange, Mbatyula / Mberev and Mbayongo council wards.\n\n\u201cAbout a hundred people have been killed by the herdsmen if not more at different places. As the attackers are going, they are killing and dropping their victims. We have not been able to recover many people.\n\n\u201cI informed the military about the attack, but these people have developed a strategy, they are not attacking one place. If they attacked Kwaghaondo village for instance, they quickly moved to another place. So, before the military could go there, they will move to another place and continue with their offensive.\n\n\u201cI have reported the incident to all the security agencies and they are aware. As I am speaking to you, I am in my office in the headquarters of the LG speaking to my traditional rulers to see what we can do in their own level.\n\n\u201cOn the allegations whether the military is compromising, he said the military were not conniving but it seems the aggrieved Gana Boys have joined forces with the herdsmen to carry out the attack.\n\n\u201cNo military connivance but I am suspecting the bandits, the existing bandits there. The Gana remnants are conniving with them to cause the havoc and unrest in our area.\n\n\u201cI think they are trying to win a cheap popularity. They have connived to do that so that we consider their demands which we have refused to do,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen contacted at the time of this report, the Police Public Relations Officer of the state command, DSP Catherine Sewuese Anene said she was yet to receive the report of the attack.\n\nPolice confirm 7 killed in Plateau\n\nAlso, the Plateau state police Command Monday confirmed that seven persons were killed Sunday night by unknown gunmen in Dong locality of Jos South local government area of the state.\n\nThe police spokesman, ASP Ubah Ogaba, in a statement early hours of Monday confirmed the incident to journalists via Whatsapp platform.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday 23/05/2021 at about 2000hrs, the command received a distress call that yet to be identified gunmen came out suddenly from a nearby bush, invaded Dong Village, Jos South LGA and killed seven persons,\u201d he said.\n\nOgaba further stated that the \u201ccombined team of policemen, STF, vigilante operatives, led by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Department of Operation, raced swiftly to the scene, but the hoodlums had already fled back into the bush.\n\n\u201cInvestigation is ongoing. Frantic effort is on to arrest the fleeing suspects. Meanwhile, security has been beefed up in that area to prevent escalation of violence.\u201d\n\nHowever, the lawmaker representing Plateau North senatorial district in the National Assembly, said contrary to the figure by the police, 14 persons were killed.\n\nA statement by the lawmaker\u2019s media aide, Musa Ashoms, said the attacks took place at two separate places.\n\n\u201cShortly after the IGP issued a Security Alert on likely terror attacks in Jos and the FCT, the blood merchants have visited terror on Dong community adjacent Wild Life Park, Jos and Kwi village, adjacent Yakubu Gowon Airport Heipang on Sunday night, 23/05/21 where 14 persons were butchered to death, including children,\u201d he stated.\n\nLalong reacts\n\nReacting to the development, Governor Simon Lalong frowned at the killings and directed security agencies to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nLalong said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the reoccurrence of violence in parts of Dong Kasa in Jos North Local Government Area and Kwi in Riyom on Sunday night where innocent citizens including children and women were murdered in cold blood.\u201d\n\nCommissioner of Information and Communication Dan Manjang in a statement described the act as barbaric, callous and a desperate attempt to rupture the peace and security of the state.\n\nSix kidnapped in Niger\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Police Command has confirmed kidnap of six residents of Gauraka area Tafa local government area of Niger state resulting in protest during which a police station was burnt\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Wasing Abiodun, in a statement in Minna Monday said the command was on top of the situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday being 24th May, 2021 at about 0300hrs, unknown gunmen attacked the residents of Angwan-Wazobia in Gauraka area of Tafa LGA where about six persons were abducted. Teams of Policemen were mobilised to the scene and efforts to rescue the victims are being intensified.\u201d\n\nAbiodun further said \u201chowever, at about 0635hrs of same date, some miscreants blocked both sides of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna expressway, protesting the recent cases of kidnapping in the community.\n\n\u201cThe miscreants later extended the protest to Gauraka Police outpost, vandalised and set it ablaze.\u201d\n\nThe command said efforts to disperse the protesters were ongoing as reinforcement had been dispatched from Minna to Area Commander Suleja as well as joint task force from Minna \u2013 Suleja highway to restore normalcy on Abuja \u2013 Kaduna express way.\n\nThe statement restated the command\u2019s calls on members of the public, parents/guardian and community leaders to caution their wards against any act of public disturbance as the Command shall continue the onslaught against criminal elements in the society.\n\n5 abducted victims rescued\n\nSimilarly, troops of Operation Safe Haven have rescued two people kidnapped while travelling along Gidan Waya-Godogodo-Jagindi road, and three herders together with their 86 cows both in Jema\u2019a local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nA statement issued Monday by the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, said the troops were on the trail of the kidnappers to rescue the remaining two travellers.\n\nHe added that a notorious armed robber was arrested in Gidan Waya.\n\n\u201cTroops of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) reported the rescue of two victims who were abducted by armed bandits along Gidan Waya-Godogodo-Jagindi road in Jema\u2019a local government area.\n\n\u201cThe commissioner was briefed at the Headquarters of Sector 7, Operation Safe Haven, Kafanchan, by the Sector Commander, Colonel D.C Nwakonobi while on a routine visit to military formations across the Southern Kaduna general area on Monday.\n\n\u201cAccording to the briefing, four passengers were abducted from a vehicle plying the route. On receiving a distress call, a patrol team from OPSH pursued the bandits and rescued the two victims. Efforts to apprehend the bandits and rescue the other victims are ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe Commander also said that the troops rescued three herders after they had been attacked at a location in the same LGA. The herders, Suleiman Mohammad, Hassan Adamu and Ya\u2019u Mokariyo, along with their 86 cows were escorted to safety by the troops, as they proceeded on their way to Jagindi.\n\n\u201cHe further informed the Commissioner, that a notorious armed robber, Umar Yusuf, was arrested by troops following an attack on private apartments which housed students of the College of Education, Gidan Waya.\n\n\u201cThe Commander said these developments occurred between Sunday night and early hours of Monday. These were beside briefings on the general security situation in the five LGAs which make up the OPSH area of responsibility, namely, Sanga, Kauru, Kaura, Zangon Kataf and Jema\u2019a local government areas.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner, on behalf of Governor Nasir el-Rufai, condoled with the officers and men of Sector 7 over the death of Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-General Ibrahim Attahiru, and thanked the troops for their alertness and responsive stance in rescuing the abducted victims and the herders.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nFollowing recent kidnapping of 37 students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation Afaka, Federal Government has concluded plans to temporarily relocate the College to a safer location within Kaduna metropolis.\n\nJust as the government announced that school fees of all the 37 kidnapped and released students have been waived throughout their study in the Institution.\n\n\n\nProvost of the College, Dr. Usman Bello, disclosed this on Monday while addressing a press conference at the College in Afaka, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna state.\n\nBandits had on March 11, 2021 stormed the College around 10pm kidnapping 39 students, mostly females. While two escaped, 10 of them were released in two batch of five each on 5th and 12th April, 2021 respectively, the remaining 27 students were released on 5th May, after spending 56 days in captivity.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Prevost, \u201cthe Hon. Minister of Environment, Dr. Muhammad Mahmood Abubakar has concluded plans to temporarily relocate the College to a safer place; put in place adequate security as well as vehicles to serve as shuttle to convey staff and students alike from the temporary site to designated bus stops within the Kaduna metropolis.\n\n\u201cAll these would be communicated to all as soon as the arrangement has been perfected.The Hon. Minister has directed that the school fees of the affected students be waived for the programmes they are currently running. Therefore, for those of them presently on ND programme, the HND fees would be waived accordingly,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSpeaking further, the Provost said, \u201cIt is important to state at this juncture that the frantic efforts of all the stakeholders including the Hon. Minister and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Environment, the Board Chairman, DG-FRIN and the Commissioner of Police, Kaduna state Command, Alhaji Umar Musa Muri, led to the rescue of the first 10 set of the abducted students.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe remaining students in captivity had to endure 55 days after their abduction before they were finally released by the bandits on Wednesday 5th May, 2021.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna state Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, finally delivered the 27 students to the College on 7th May, 2021 alongside the Commissioner of Police, Kaduna state Command amidst a jubilant gathering of the college management, staff, parents and students with members of the press from local and international media covering the event.\n\n\u201cAfter another head count was taken following the release of all the abducted students, I would like to set the record straight that 37 students were taken into captivity against the 39 earlier reported. This is due to the subsequent escape of two of the students during the incident. I am therefore pleased to inform you that all the 37 students have been successfully reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Almighty God for His divine intervention. I also wish to express our profound gratitude to Sheikh (Dr.) Ahmad Gumi and other stakeholders for their relentless efforts that culminated into the release of the students. The College is also appreciative of all the security agencies for the role they played during the incident.\n\n\n\n\u201cI equally want to thank all the parents and students for their patience and understanding with the college management during the unfortunate incident. I would like to use this medium to appeal to all parents/guardians to allow their children/wards to pursue their education to the end. I want to acknowledge the press for covering this story right from when it broke to this very moment.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

We are starting with government schools and will thereafter move to private schools.\n\n\u201cWe are already in good discussion with both states and private proprietors to ensure that this is done because this is the single largest investment you can make to your country, the future generation in ensuring that they get good quality education\u201d, he said.\n\nThe permanent secretary added that the conduct of the examination has been encouraging due to some new IT features introduced to checkmate issues of malpractices.\n\n\u201cThe process is seamless and with the introduction of technology, we also improving efficiency and innovations. We believe that going forward, this is something that people can look up to in a regular calendar and as a prerequisite for you to become a teacher in this country. So if you do not have this certification, you are not a teacher; you do not have the right to practice.\n\nEchono also disclosed that the ministry is collaborating with Ministry of Communication, National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, and other agencies that require data to have a situation where the identity of all primary school children will be stored as soon as a child registers in any primary school in the country.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal in the education sector is to be able to collaborate. We have been doing this with the Ministry of Communication, with NIMC and also with other agencies that require data.\n\n\u201cWe want a situation where from the point where a child registers in any primary school in this country up to death, you have your records, you can update them as you move on but you cannot change your identity,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, a database of all qualified teachers has been compiled, adding that the government will make available the database to states to facilitate employment of qualified teachers who are not currently engaged.\n\nOn the new salary structure of teachers approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, he said.\u201cNow, even in the public service, every day I am inundated with requests by people who originally studied education but find themselves working in different agencies and ministries, wanting to return to their original careers because now the remuneration will be higher than the civil service scale, and they even have a tenure that extends five years more than what the average civil servant will do.\n\n\u201cAnd again, we have commenced the implementation of this; we are working closely with the head of service; she\u2019s been wonderful and very supportive, and salaries and wages commission to as we speak, computing those rural allowances, science allowances, hazard and so on to ensure that teachers get their reward her on earth and not hereafter.\n\nEarlier, Mrs Jacinta Ogboso, TRCN Acting Director, Specification and Licencing disclosed that about 17,141 were to participate in the batch \u2018A\u2019 examination nationwide.\n\nWhile disclosing that Osun state has the highest number of candidates, she added that all teachers must sit and pass the examination before they would be considered as qualified teachers.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of teachers with special needs, she said that the TRCN chief executive has been addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cThe issue of people with special needs among the teachers is something that cannot be overlooked. However, there are certain issues that one cannot wake up and deal with in just one day.\n\n\u201cWe have commenced the process of addressing, identifying and knowing them.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has criticised and appeared to query the legality of the decision by Governors of the country\u2019s southern states to ban open grazing in their region.\n\nThe Nigerian leader also said there was no solution offered from resolutions of the governors to the herder-farmer clashes.\n\nMr Buhari stated this on Monday while describing the actions of the Southern Governors Forum as acts of politicking intended to demonstrate their power.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s views were expressed in a statement by his spokesman Garba Shehu who noted that \u201cthe President had approved a number of specific measures to bring a permanent end to the frequent skirmishes as recommended by Alhaji Sabo Nanono, the Minister of Agriculture in a report he submitted and the President signed off on it back in April, well before the actions of the Southern Governors Forum which attempts to place a ban on open grazing and other acts of politicking intended by its signatories to demonstrate their power\u201d.\n\nHe added further that \u201cIt is very clear that there was no solution offered from their resolutions to the herder-farmer clashes that have been continuing in our country for generations.\n\n\u201cBut the citizens of the southern states \u2013 indeed citizens of all states of Nigeria \u2013 have a right to expect their elected leaders and representatives to find answers to challenges of governance and rights, and not to wash their hands off hard choices by, instead, issuing bans that say: \u201cnot in my state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is equally true that their announcement is of questionable legality, given the Constitutional right of all Nigerians to enjoy the same rights and freedoms within every one of our 36 states (and FCT) -regardless of the state of their birth or residence.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Shehu, the President has approved an actionable plan that will lead to the emergence of a permanent solution to the frequent clashes between farmers and gun-wielding \u201ckiller herdsmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, this declaration has been preempted, for whatever it is intended to achieve and Mr. President, who has rightly been worried about these problems more than any other citizen in consultation with farmers and herders alike, commissioned and approved an actionable plan of rehabilitating grazing reserves in the states, starting with those that are truly committed to the solution and compliant with stated requirements,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cWith veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families including schooling \u2013 through these rehabilitated reserves, the Federal Government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side: supporting farmers to till their fields, herders to rear their livestock and Nigerians everywhere to be safe.\n\n\u201cThe entire country is acutely aware of the strain the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on public finances, for both Federal and States. Still, given the pressing urgency of addressing the perennial challenges, the federal funding for the project that has been delayed is now being partly unlocked. Actual work for the full actualization of the modern reserve system in a few of the consenting states should take off in June.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
