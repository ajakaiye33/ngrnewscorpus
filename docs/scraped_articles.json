          "text": "The Nigerian Army (NA) has lost its bid to reverse a judgment in favour of Colonel Danladi Ribah Hassan.\n\nHassan, who led troops to recapture Bulabulin and Damboa from Boko Haram in 2014, was compulsorily retired in 2016.\n\nOn Friday, a three-member panel of the Court of Appeal in Abuja dismissed the NA appeal for lack of merit, PRNigeria reports.\n\nIn January 2019, the National Industrial Court (NIC) ordered the reabsorption of Hassan, one of the 38 officers compulsorily retired without strong reasons.\n\nDAILY POST published the full list of affected personnel in June 2020.\n\nJustice Sanusi Kado of the NIC then held that the Army failed to convince the court of the disciplinary grounds for the forceful retirement.\n\nIn the new judgement, Justice Stephen Adah resolved the two issues raised for determination against the appellants.\n\nAdah sustained the judgment of the NIC delivered in favour of Colonel Hassan on January 8, 2019.\n\nThe appeal marked CA/A/299/2019 was filed by the Nigerian Army Council, Armed Forces Council, Chief of Defence Staff, ex-Defence Minister, Brig. Gen. Mansur Dan-Ali (rtd); Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (ex-COAS) and Maj. Gen. Mohammed Hong Garba.\n\nThe respondents were Hassan and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nThe Court of Appeal held that, as against the claim by the appellants, Hassan complied with the condition precedent, as required under Section 178 of the Armed Forces Act, before approaching the court.\n\nThe court ruled that the appellants\u2019 claim that the decision of the lower court was a perversity did not hold water, because it was based on the evidence presented before it by the parties.\n\nThe NIC, according to the judgement, had elaborate consideration of the facts \u2013 from the accusers, the accused person and witnesses \u2013 before concluding that the compulsory retirement was done in error.\n\n\u201cLetter of compulsory retirement was also set aside and he was ordered to be reinstated. A letter was issued to that effect, reinstating him into the Nigerian Army with all rights and privileges.\n\n\u201cThere is no piece of evidence that is contrary to what the court has said. So, there is nothing that is perverse by the findings of the lower court.\n\n\u201cThe law states that where the lower court makes any finding of facts and there is nothing that is adverse, that is contrary to justice, or any thing that orchestrated injustice on the line of the consideration of the lower court.\n\n\u201cWhere the court has made correct and straightforward findings of facts, this court has no business interfering with it.\n\n\u201cThe trial court did excellently well in this case, and we have no need to interfere with the findings of the court.\n\n\u201cIt is in this respect that we come to the conclusion that this appeal is lacking in merit. It is grossly lacking in merit, and it is hereby dismissed.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the lower court is upheld and all the decisions made therein, are also sustained\u201d, Justice Adah said.\n\nOn August 6, 2014, the 25 Task Force Brigade led by Hassan retook Bulabulin and Damboa from the grip of Boko Haram. Several terrorists died.\n\nThe officer was 7 Division Garrison Commander, responsible for the security of Maiduguri and its environs, before he was directed to lead the operation.\n\nThe member of NDA 41 Regular Combatant Course also played a role in Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) reform.\n\nHassan was commissioned in September 1994 and served as instructor, staff officer and field commander.\n\nHe took part in ECOMOG operations in Liberia, Sierra Leone, as well as the United Nations Mission in Sudan.\n\nThe native of Danko Wasagu Local Government Area of Kebbi State was formerly Chief Security Officer to the Sierra Leonean Chief of Defence Staff.\n\n\u2013",

          "text": "AS soon as you set your eyes on the slim, tall and beautiful lady, you are attracted by her elegance and charisma. Her sash announces her as Miss blind Nigeria and as she sashayed elegantly around the MUSON center Lagos, you are amazed at her confidence, soft spoken accent, guts, dreams, the infectious laughter, warmth and aura that radiates.\n\nWelcome to the world of Faith Ihediwa who is currently a final year English Language undergraduate of the University of Lagos.\n\nHow easy was it getting into the University of Lagos?\n\nAt first I never believed that a visually impaired person can enjoy something as good as going into the university. But I thank God for the great home Bethsaida that God used to make this happen. They took away that veil from my face and made me understand that in disability there is ability.\n\nIs it convenient climbing the stairs or getting to lectures on time?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nYes, I have a helper in school. In addition, even though there is staircase in the University of Lagos, we have lifts that takes us to the lecture rooms with ease. My target is to get a first class and I know that God can do it\n\nHow has it been?\n\nTo an extent, it has not been easy especially when it comes to the phonetics part. Trying out sounds like p, t, k and b, d, g. For those of us that are visually impaired it is usually difficult for us to write the signs. So, what we do is to tell our friend that this is it and that is what it should be. Sometimes, during the examinations they have to skip that part for us. Instead they give us theories to write.\n\nWhat are some of the extra curriculum activities that you engage in on campus?\n\nSome of the extra curriculum activities are interesting and I participate in them. I go to parties just to have fun. I also attend seminars and things that give me a better view about life.\n\nWhat are the other plans that you have?\n\nI would like to be an advertiser in future because I am very good when it comes to voice over and so many other things related to creativity. I would show you some of my artworks after the interview so that you have an idea of what I am talking about. I do advertisement for people and I enjoy it.\n\nHow did you get to win the Miss Blind Nigeria pageant?\n\nI competed with all the visually impaired ladies in Nigeria from the different states in the country. It was a very interesting and memorable experience for me and the ladies. They all came to Lagos for the competition and the experience is something that I treasure so much. And by the grace of God, I emerged as a winner at the end of the day.\n\nWhen did the competition take place?\n\nThe Miss blind Nigeria pageant took place in 2019 and I have been carrying out my duties as the queen. So, far, I would say that they journey has been awesome and quite memorable.\n\nWhen are they going to have the next competition for a new queen?\n\nIf anybody can withstand my beauty and the level of my intelligence then the person is good to go.\n\nFor most pageants, the beauty queen usually has a pet project. Do you have something that you are working on?\n\nYes, I also have a pet project that I am handling. My own project is something that is also very interesting. My aim is to go to the rural areas to bring in the visually impaired one, motivate them and give them a sense of belonging. Most parents believe that the moment your child is blind, the child is useless. The child for them is worth nothing to them and the society. That is not the case and we need to change that mindset. So, I would be going around to educate them, champion the cause of visually impaired people especially the young ones and let them know that the child is a treasure; you can get something very unique and great from the child.\n\nAs an example, I make them know that yes, I am blind but I am into different things, sometimes even doing things that people who can see are not doing. I am a student, I cook and I am involved in so many other activities on my own. This are the things that I make them understand and that had made me a source of inspiration and motivation. In doing this, I have been able to bring more than 20 students to Bethsaida home during this transformation process. Most of them are in the University of Nsukka presently and other universities.\n\nTell us about your parents and the role they played in your life?\n\nMy parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ihediwa are lovely people. They are the best parents anyone can ask for in the world. Despite my disability, they have supported me so much and it did not cease or reduce the love that they have for me. They still give me that respect and give me attention as well as treat me as I am meant to be treated.\n\nWere you born blind?\n\nNot at all! I got blind at the age of 15 years. It actually happened immediately after my senior WAEC examination. I did my WAEC Examinations at Flourish College, Love hall, Ketu Lagos. My performance in school then was awesome, I had B\u2019s and A\u2019s and did very well when the results came out.\n\nWhat was the first reaction of the family when it happened?\n\nAt first it was not easy at all. But as time went on, they adjusted gradually and got to understand that a blind person can still be relevant to the society. It was at that point that my parents got to accept the condition and began to work on ways to channel me to places and things where my dreams can be fulfilled.\n\nWhat do they do for a living?\n\nThey are into business and they are very dedicated and hardworking people. I admire their energy, courage and perseverance.\n\nWhat plans do you have for the future?\n\nI want to become a professor of English Language. By the grace of God, I also want to be an author, to write books. That is why I am into writing poems. I have numerous poems that I have written and also showed some lecturers in the university and they have been approved by them.\n\nTell us about the people that you look up to, your role models and mentors?\n\nOne of the people that I admire is the great writer, Chinua Achebe. The other is Professor Wole Soyinka; he is a great writer and a great activist, a super role model to many people. Those are the kind of people that I look up to. I love their level of writing, creativity and the fact that they stand out in many ways. They pass and communicate their message to their readers in a way that is mind blowing.\n\nYou must be very stylish from a younger age, looking at how you are dressed and the way you catwalk?\n\nI rehearse every time, each time I walk is an opportunity to assess myself and tell the world the stuff that I am made of. I walk with style, I talk with style, and everything I do is done with a sense of style. So, at every time and every moment. I do my rehearsal and I am proud of who I have become. I know that I have a great future ahead. How have you been enjoying the festive season?\n\nI must say that it has been very interesting with a number of activities that are memorable. As you can see we are here at the MUSON centre for the Musical show and it is something that we are all excited about. This is Mr Blind Nigeria and we are all enthusiastic about what we are experiencing today, we look forward to the coming year with a lot of expectations. I strongly believe that it will come with new opportunities to excel.\n\nWhat advice do you have for Nigerians?\n\nWe have to show love and care for one another. We are all brothers and sisters no matter where you come from. At this time, my message is that we must care for the next person. We must all work hard to achieve a better future for the next generation. Our collective effort is needed to make the Nation better and great. A lot of young people have great potentials and it is important for our leaders to include their views when planning.",

          "text": "What a year 2021 turned out to be! I still shudder as I pen this article, this was indeed a year of many mind blowing events as well as turned out to be a year of many losses as well as gains!\n\nThe first salvo came from the Federal Government when it announced its ban on crypto currency and urged all financial institutions to desist from trading or doing business with entities that facilitated such trade, basing its decision on the lack of regulation of such transactions. Nigerians largely saw this policy shift as an insensitive one, owing to the heavy involvement of its youths in the crypto business, despite this, the CBN had a valid argument as the crypto currency business largely offers a number of phony businesses and the dirty money generated from such a safe haven.\n\nPolitics as always dominated much of such events, issues such as the clamor for balkanization of Nigeria, terrorism and banditry topped the charts, with the continuous calls for restructuring playing in the background in somber tones.\n\nFor Nigeria\u2019s separatist champions , the Buhari led administration reiterated its belief in the sanctity of one Nigeria by effecting the arrests of the likes of Sunday Igboho and his IPOB counterpart Nnamdi Kanu. There were however little or no cheers for such arrests and prior to that period, the SouthEast region began witnessing a series of small scale attacks on security establishments and its personnel. Many were quick to blame the Indigenous People of Biafra and its paramilitary organization, the Eastern Security Network, ESN, however, a number of other suggestions pointed at such activities as the dastardly acts of shadow groups and fifth columnists, similar to the work of the Italian right wing group Ordine Nuovo ( New Order) which carried out a number of terrorist activities such as the bombing of the Piazza Fontana but then presented it as some sort of insurgency by the Italian Communists, diminishing their electoral value and keeping Italy within the capitalist orbit.\n\nThe restructuring music continued to shake the country into some level of renewed consciousness. With Governor Rotimi Akeredolu playing the strings like some Jimmy Hendrix. Weary of the kidnappings and killings of innocent people and haven received a number of security reports that such acts were carried out by the dreaded Fulani Herdsmen, Akeredolu ordered all herdsmen living within the State\u2019s Forest Reserves to vacate the area. This call however exposed the fragile lines on which this nation appears to exist upon as Akeredolu was immediately countered by a number of Fulani leaders who took the Akeredolu ultimatum to these criminal herders as an inter ethnic war.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNotable among such is the Governor of Bauchi State, who in his zeal to perhaps become visible as a Fulani leader threw pure reasoning away and stood logic on its head making a number of faux pas\u2019s on the matter. Bala Mohammed did not only justify the rights of Fulani Herdsmen to illegally bear arms, he also conferred a global citizenship status on the Fulani Herdsmen and their rights to move wherever they liked even on the ancestral lands of other ethnic groups who are obviously denied such global or national citizenship. He proclaimed with blood curdling glee that the Forest Reserves belonged to no one, and that all land belonged to Nigerians, thus allowing the Fulani Herdsmen to reside wherever they wanted. Such incendiary talk made many marvel!\n\nWith Akeredolu throwing down the gauntlet, the demand for the restructuring of the Nigerian nation received a boost as his colleagues in the Southern half of Nigeria under the auspices of the Asaba declaration took a firm stand against open grazing as well as called for the devolution of powers to the state\u2019s, state police and some sort of national dialogue to ensure restructuring.\n\nThere was also some rumbling within the two major political parties in Nigeria. The APC led by a sitting Governor continued to navigate the stormy waters of party politics as they extended their stay as a caretaker entity beyond its mandate of six months initially given to it. It went on to conduct ward, local and state congresses despite a minority ruling of the Supreme Court on the Ondo Guber Elections which faulted the fact that the Caretaker Committee Chairman In Governor Mai Mala Buni could not also act as the Chairman of the APC owing to the stipulations of Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nInternally there were a number of fissures within the APC against Buni\u2019s continued leadership but somehow, Buni has successfully managed to meander between such landmines amidst the whispers that the CECPC which he leads may not be leaving office anytime soon. Sadly, his counterpart in the PDP, Uche Secondus was not so lucky as he fell prey to the long knives of the Governors within his party\u2019s fold.\n\nMay Nigeria Succeed!",

          "text": "PETER and Paul Okoye, the duo of P-Square have reunited to become a musical band again after almost five years of the split.\n\nThe journey of identical twins and the disagreement between them and their elder brother, Jude \u2018Engees\u2019 Okoye, which led to a major feud is not new to those who know the family in their formative years.\n\nUnknown to many, even as an upcoming music duo, the twins were usually at loggerhead over who is the most creative but they consistently managed to keep it away from the fans.\n\nWhile it is public knowledge that Paul has a keen interest in singing and creating songs, Peter is easily smitten with dance and choreography.\n\nHowever, Peter had consistently told those who cared to listen that he is very creative in the group. The 40-year-old father of three had repeatedly noted that he can sit down and decipher what people want to hear, what they want to see, and what they want to learn from but would rather not brag about it.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSpeaking ahead of their reunion concert, Paul went live on Instagram to tell his critics that he\u2019s more than a singer but a professional dancer.\n\n\u201cYou guys think I don\u2019t know how to dance, I am a full-time dancer. I just dey pretend. I hold the dance for Peter when he was sick for days.\u201d\n\nThe Fights\n\nAccording to a source, the duo\u2019s disagreement didn\u2019t start five years or even six years ago. The Nation\u2019s source divulged that both Peter and Paul Okoye grew up disagreeing over almost everything. The source went further to say that the two are quick to argue over their unique attributes insisting one is better than the other.\n\nHowever, the two never went their separate ways nor nurtured the idea of going solo. And this was due to the presence of their late mother, who knew how to handle their anger.\n\nThings went south shortly after their mum died in 2012, after battling cancer.\n\nDon\u2019t ever take sides between twins\n\nFive years after ending their rift, the sensational singers have advised people and fans to never take sides.\n\nThe twin brothers, who recently buried their hatches made this statement during a live session with fans.\n\n\u201cPeople should be mindful of what they say and learn never to take sides against two brothers. Those who took sides during our split are suffering our reunion now,\u201d Peter Okoye.\n\nIn his words, Paul explains what he observed during their reunion party.\n\nAccording to him, the reunion is about him and his brother but their family, friends, and fans who took sides following their feud now feel bad because they are back together.\n\n\u201cDuring our reunion celebration, we saw a close friend, who had forgotten they were friends just because they took sides. So, people should just chill and enjoy our music, and not hate. Our reunion is not about the P-Square but the entertainment industry as a whole.\u201d\n\nAdding to her husband\u2019s take, Anita Okoye, said she was excited for not taking sides during the breakup between her husband and his twin brother.\n\n\u201cThis is the best birthday present either of you could receive. Thank you for letting me have such a great relationship with both of you independent of your rift\u2026 I am delighted I didn\u2019t let your coconut heads let me choose sides.\u201d\n\nReactivating the magic\n\nOn November 17, 2021, fans of P-Square couldn\u2019t hide their emotions after a video of the identical twins hit social media. In the clip, the duo and their elder brother, Jude were seen hugging each other in Peter\u2019s residence in Lagos.\n\nThe pair also followed each other on Instagram with the twins celebrating themselves at their 40th birthday.\n\n\u201cTwo heads are better than one,\u201d Paul captioned their picture together.\n\nIn the same vein, the wife of Paul, Anita Okoye also organised a party with her children to celebrate Paul and Peter\u2019s reunion.\n\nRestoring the dimmed glory\n\nAfter years of solo projects and differences, P-Square is on a redemption journey to restore what seemed like a deemed glory, and Darey and Deola Art-Alade\u2019s Livespot gave them the opportunity.\n\nThe twins were given the opportunity to reactivate their musical journey with a concert and despite a week postponement, it happened on December 25, 2021. Peter and Paul staged a reunion concert tagged:\u2019 Psquare Reactivated\u2019 to officially announce their comeback.\n\nDuring their performance, the band paused to apologise for their separation.\n\n\u201cWe apologise for breaking up, deep apologies to our fans all over the world. We want everyone around the world to know that we are asking for forgiveness,\u201d the P-Square duo said.\n\nThe group had to cancel different shows in Nigeria to concentrate on their first concert after their breakup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided not to perform at different events just to focus on our concert. We want you to see us together after many years of hiatus.\u201d Peter said.\n\nContinuing he said, \u201cSelecting songs for our concert is what broke me down because we have about 60 songs and we\u2019ve been rehearsing back to back for three weeks. We had dance rehearsal scheduled between 12 pm- 3 pm, band rehearsal for 5 pm \u2013 9 pm then will enter the studio by 11 pm till midnight.\u201d\n\nPaul added: \u201cWe rehearsed like hell.\u201d\n\nAnd it won\u2019t be wrong to say P-Square is back again to the dismay of \u2018busybodies.\u2019",

          "title": "We remain resolute, insecurity will not halt our programmes, plans \u2013 Buhari",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said that notwithstanding the threat of insecurity in the country, his administration remains resolute to continue with its programmes and plans.\n\nHe said this in his new year message to Nigerians as the country join the rest of the world to welcome the new year.\n\nThe President, who commended the nation\u2019s security agencies for the efforts to restore peace, stressed that the issue of security will remain at the front burner, adding that as a follow up to his promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, his administration has invested heavily in re-equipping thr military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that to win the war on insecurity, the hearts and minds of the affected citizens must be won. To this end, he said working with international partners and neighbouring countries, the federal government would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nWhile commiserating with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country, he assured that every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to him both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\nHe assured that his administration remains fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\nOn job creation, the President said in the new year, his administration leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of the economy creates more support to other emerging sectors.\n\nThe New Year Message read thus:\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\nI salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\nThe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\nThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nThere is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nThe net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\nGovernment, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nOnce again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nWe equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\nWe remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\nOn the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\nThe major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nWe may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\nDespite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\nJust like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\nIn year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\nWe have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\nIn the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\nDespite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\nAs we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\nAs it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\nI wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari",

The next election that we Yoruba people will engage in will be the first election in our own new country.\n\n\u201cThe second issue is that the Yoruba self-determination struggle will employ the powers of the law more emphatically to resist the abuses of human rights in our Yoruba homeland.

          "title": "FG Outlines Administration\u2019s 100 Achievements in 2021",
          "text": "Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe federal government, yesterday, presented the scorecard of President Muhammadu Buhari, citing 100 core achievements of his administration in 2021. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who listed the achievements, said they were despite dwindling revenues, COVID-19 pandemic, and insecurity in several parts of the country induced by insurgency and banditry.\n\nMohammed, who addressed the media in Lagos, said government\u2019s economic recovery plan remained on a steady path throughout 2021. He said the country\u2019s domestic growth in the first three quarters of 2021 was positive, recording real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 0.51 per cent in the first quarter (Q1), 5.01 per cent in Q2, and 4.03 per cent in Q3.\n\nThe minister said the record was a departure from the declining performance in the first three quarters of 2020, which led to economic recession, put at 1.87 per cent in Q1, -6.10 per cent in Q2, and -3.62 per cent in Q3.\n\nHe said the economic performance in 2021 was a reflection of steady improvement in growth over the last three quarters of 2020, arising from government\u2019s policies and strategies, such as the Economic Sustainability Plan and the N500 billion COVID-19 crisis intervention fund, among others.\n\nMohammed stressed that under the Buhari administration, the rate of inflation had continued to decline on a year-on-year basis since April 2021. He said from the trend, a decline was recorded, from 17.93 per cent in May to 17.01 per cent in August, 15.99 per cent in October and 15.40 per cent in November 2021.\n\nHe disclosed that the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning generated N1.53 trillion from Value Added Tax (VAT), while N496.4 billion was generated from VAT in the first three months of 2021, the highest in nine years.\n\nThe minister also said crude oil export improved considerably at N10.03 trillion, compared to N6.92 trillion. This represented a growth rate of 44.93 per cent, despite the fact that real growth showed poorer performance in 2021, recording 2.21 per cent (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, -12.65 per cent in Q2 2021 and \u201310.73 per cent in Q3 2021, from stronger growth of 5.06 per cent in Q1 2020, -6.63 per cent in Q2 2020, and -13.89 per cent in Q3 2020.\n\nAccording to Mohammed, \u201cThe recovery of the economy remained on a steady path throughout the year 2021. As you are aware, gentlemen, many countries around the world face unprecedented challenges, starting from 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Nigeria is no exception.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy was hit by the pandemic in mid- 2020, and the economic disruptions led to a recession. The poor performance of the economy during the COVID-19 era affected output growth, trade, household welfare and livelihood.\u201d\n\nHe said the federal government recovered from the dire conditions by rolling out effective fiscal and monetary policies as well as health plan designed to control the spread of the pandemic and mitigate its negative effects on the economy.\n\nThe minister disclosed that non- oil export grew by 21.17 per cent, from N1.19 trillion to N1.44 trillion over the same period. He said the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) carried out various operations across the country to enhance security.\n\nHe said the Joint Task Force, Operation Hadin Kai, covering the restive North-east, neutralised over 1,000 terrorists, rescued 2,000 civilians, and superintended the surrender of over 22,000 terrorists, including their families.\n\nMohammed said during the period under review, the Nigerian Army procured 160 MRAPS, 150 trucks, and 60 APCs to improve its equipment holding. Various kits were equally provided for troops.\n\nHe said over 1,500 persons were recruited into the Nigerian Navy during the year while the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of 12 Super Tucanos and 3 JF-17 Thunder Fighter Aircraft and other platforms with which it conducted several air interdictions, provided close air support to ground troops, and destroyed several illegal structures and equipment belonging to terrorists, bandits, and other criminal elements.\n\nOther achievements of the Buhari administration, according to the minister, included passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA); incorporation of NNPC Limited under CAMA; entrenchment of Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE) in NNPC; posting of N287 billion profit by NNPC, the first time it will record such profit in 44 years; and the Final Investment Decision on $3.6 billion integrated methanol and gas project in Odioma, Brass Island, Bayelsa State, which was scheduled to come into operation in 2024 and was expected to produce 10,000 tons of methanol daily.\n\nOhers were the $260 million Funding Agreement for ANOH Gas Processing Company Limited (AGPC), a project that would deliver 300 million standard cubic feet of gas per day and 1,200 megawatts of electricity to the domestic market, and the launch of Nigerian Upstream Cost Optimisation Programme (NUCOP) to drive down the cost of crude oil production in the country and make Nigeria competitive in the global market.\n\nMohammed also listed the award of $1.5 billion contract for the rehabilitation of Port Harcourt Refinery to Tecnimont SPA of Italy; construction and rehabilitation of 21 roads under the federal government\u2019s Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme; construction of Kano-Maiduguri Road Section II (100.08 kilometres, (Shuwarin-Azare) in Jigawa and Bauchi States, Kano-Maiduguri Road Section III (Azare-Potiskum) 106.34 kilometres in Bauchi and Yobe states, Vandeikya-Obudu Cattle Ranch Road Phase I and II (24 kilometres) in Benue and Cross River states, Sokoto-Tambuwal-Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road (304 kilometres), 360-metre bridge at Ikom in Cross River State, which had been completed and now awaiting commissioning, 400-metre border bridge between Nigeria and Cameroon, which was also completed and awaiting commissioning, and Second Niger Bridge, now 78 per cent complete and expected to be ready in November 2022.\n\nMohammed also cited the designation of four international airports in Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Port Harcourt as Special Economic Zones, aimed at encouraging business/investment, the procurement of two mobile control towers in Lagos and Abuja airports, and the provisional approval, which the Ministry of Aviation received for the establishment of Aerospace University in Abuja.\n\nHe also listed the flag-off of the commercial operation of Lagos-Ibadan rail line in June 2021 and the signing of the MoU with Portuguese company, Mota-Engil Group, for the construction of $1.959 billion Kano-Maradi standard gauge railway lines, as well as the ground-breaking ceremony for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the 2,044-kilometre Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Eastern Narrow Gauge Railway project and Bonny Deep Sea and Railway Industrial Park, in addition to the ground-breaking ceremony of the Kano-Kaduna Standard Gauge Rail-line Modernisation project.\n\nThe minister said 12 dams were completed in a bid to maximise dam infrastructure, while 96,000 hectares of irrigation land were developed in 2021. He noted there was a review of the Expatriate Quota fees, which ensured generation of additional revenue for the federal government.\n\nHe praised the Buhari administration for approving Legal Notices, which allowed local governments to conduct Statutory Marriages sequel to compliance with regulations by the Ministry, in line with the Marriage Act of 1958 as amended. He also commended the president for approving the National Action Plan to end statelessness in Nigeria, as required by the UN, the launch of the new visa policy reclassifying the visa categories from six to 79, and processing of visa on arrival to holders of passports of African countries.\n\nThe minister also credited the administration for the Passport Issuance Reform, which ensured the clearing of a backlog of 96,083 passport applications between January and September this year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Restates few people squandered region\u2019s fund in over two decades\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Okon Bassey in Uyo\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to recover all misappropriated funds of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Buhari also emphasised the readiness of his administration to prosecute all culprits indicted in the NDDC forensic report currently being reviewed by the federal government.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, during the virtual inauguration of the NDDC Prototype Hostel at the University of Uyo, the president declared, \u201cThe serial abuse, lack of delivery and what had become an entrenched institutional decay, was the reason why I called for the forensic audit.\n\n\u201cTherefore, going forward, we shall ensure every recoverable kobo is recovered for use in service of the people of this region and those found culpable shall face the law.\u201d\n\nHe regretted that a few people had squandered the special development fund for the region for more than 20 years, leaving many in penury.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cThe Niger Delta Development Commission needs to demonstrate that it can achieve the objectives it was conceived for and make its impact felt all over the Niger Delta Region.\n\n\u201cThe lives of the people of the Niger Delta could be so much better, if the funding received by this commission since its inception, in billions of naira over the last 20 years, have been judiciously deployed in service of the people.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I want to use the opportunity of this commissioning to direct all statutory contributors to the NDDC to remit all outstanding funds to the Commission, and to ensure this is done transparently and according to laid down procedure and process.\u201d\n\nBuhari also directed that all abandoned projects that directly impacted the livelihood of the people should be revived and completed.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWhen I directed the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs to institute a forensic audit of the commission, after many representations by major stakeholders in the Niger Delta, I had also directed that all viable projects, which had been abandoned, but which would impact positively on the lives and livelihoods of the people, be immediately revived and completed\u201d\n\nThe president noted that the contract for the building of 1,050 capacity hostel for male and female students was awarded in 2004, saying like many others, it was abandoned.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis prototype university hostel consists of 1,050 bed spaces, 525 each for males and females, and is furnished to meet the needs of a university student. The complex also boasts of significant hard and soft infrastructure to ensure its sustainability and durability.\n\n\u201cThe completion of this structure is equally in recognition of the importance government attaches to providing quality housing and improved education for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, another important proof that this administration is committed to satisfying the needs of the people, throughout Nigeria, and fulfilling their expectations. Government must continue in its efforts to serve the people, by providing amenities, as well as the enabling environment for scholarships, investments across all sectors, for sustenance of the environment, and overall growth of the economy.\n\n\u201cSignificant part of this success story is that it could easily not have happened. The contract for this hostel was awarded as far back as 2004. It was one of many projects abandoned across the Niger Delta region, but which I directed the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to expeditiously complete and put to use.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Buhari said across many public universities and institutions of higher learning, students faced accommodation challenges, while private investors took advantage of the gap to provide accommodation, unfortunately, tasking the resources of parents and guardians.\n\nHe said, \u201cMany of them are located far away from school premises and come with their own peculiar challenges. It is good that such an infrastructure gap is being addressed, by providing accommodation for students that would be affordable, well built, and in a secure environment.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, had on his behalf commissioned the Special Protections Unit Base 6 Barracks in Omagwa, Rivers State, which was built and donated to the Nigeria Police by the Niger Delta Development Commission.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirstly, and as stated at that occasion, the complex is part of a crucial component of the major reform we are undertaking with the Nigerian Police Force. While we are working to increase the number of police personnel, within set yearly targets, and re-equip personnel, both in personal gear and hardware, accommodation remains an important feature of that reform.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it showed that we can alleviate the accommodation challenges of senior security personnel in order to enhance security in the region.\n\n\u201cSecondly, this singular intervention demonstrates that NDDC understands the importance of government\u2019s effort at improving the lives and livelihoods of our police officers, in line with my directive that building of barracks for men and women of the police force should be done in collaboration with the Special Housing effort of the Family Home funds.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his speech, Akpabio said the completion of the NDDC headquarters complex and other projects clearly showed the president\u2019s commitment to improving the livelihood of people in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe added, \u201cPresident Buhari is focused on development of Nigeria and the Niger Delta. The president wants to ensure that by the time he leaves office, the NDDC is repositioned to live up to the expectations of the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, who was represented by the Commissioner for Power and Petroleum Development, Dr. John Etim, praised the president over the completion and commissioning of the hostel.\n\nSpeaking also, Sole Administrator of NDDC, Mr. Effiong Akwa, thanked the president for honouring the institution by commissioning three projects in a year.\n\n\u201cThe three projects have one thing in common, they were all abandoned before the forensic audit,\u201d Effiong added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Lagos-based research and investment firm stated that while Lagos residents spent 1,080 hours in traffic a year, residents of London, which is said to have the highest congestion in the world, spent about 148 hours.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cLagosians are spending approximately 1,080 hours a year in traffic, compared to 148 hours in London, the city with the worst traffic jams in the world (excluding Nigeria and Egypt).\n\n\u201cThis comes to 12.5 per cent of the time in a year. It also translates to 6.76 years in a life expectancy of 55 years.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, compared to Lagos\u2019 1,080 hours, residents of Paris spend 140 hours in traffic, Brussels (134), Palermo (109), Moscow (108), Rome (107), Chicago (104), Lyon (102), New York (102), and Bucharest (98).\n\nDespite efforts by successive governments to solve the traffic challenge in Lagos, there has been no major breakthrough, as residents languish for hours in the intractable hold-ups, wasting several man-hours.\n\nResearch organisations, like SBM Intelligence, had suggested an upgrade of the infrastructure in the water transport sector to encourage commuters to patronise boats and ferries to reduce the perennial traffic congestion in Lagos.\n\nOther studies had advocated a mass movement mode of transportation, like the rail system, to move people in one of the world\u2019s most populated cities.\n\nIn other issues, the FDC report stated that economic policy vagueness and \u201cregulatory autocracy\u201d plagued the Nigerian economy for most part of 2021.\n\nIt stated, \u201cIt was a year best described as \u2018in like a lion, and out like a lamb\u2019. But in reality, it was almost the opposite because of mixed signals.\n\n\u201cThe economic growth maintained a slow and steady path as was expected but could be threatened by a rude interruption of the Omicron variant and the spectre of precision lockdowns.\n\n\u201cThis notwithstanding, Nigerians are still frustrated with data that shows falling inflation in an environment of higher prices.\u201d\n\nIn the Christmas edition of the monthly report, the FDC further extrapolated possible exchange rate scenarios based on oil price sensitivity, giving an external boundary of N610/$ and an optimistic scenario of N530/$.\n\nStressing that some of the economic imponderables were becoming clearer, the firm noted that just as the US fed was determined to increase interest rates three times in 2022 and the Bank of England had pushed up its policy rate to 0.25 per cent per annum, the implication of higher dollar interest rates was an excruciating external debt service burden for Nigeria, compounded by the subsidy overhang.\n\nOn the oil market, the FDC projected an optimistic oil price of $70-$75 and a $60 to $65 negative scenario for the first half of 2022, while oil production would hit 1.55 million barrels per day in a positive scenario and 1.3 million barrels per day in a negative scenario.\n\nIt predicted that fuel subsidy removal by the second quarter would take the price of the product to between N320 and N350 per litre while government spending on imports of petroleum products could taper from the last quarter of next year.\n\nIt also predicted a positive balance of trade at -$1.90 billion and a negative scenario of -$9 billion, while external reserves would increase to $42 to $43 billion for a positive projection and $35 billion in a pessimistic analysis.\n\nAccording to the report, while government revenue was estimated to increase in 2022, on the back of improved tax revenue and proceeds from subsidy removal, fiscal deficit would narrow to 2.8 per cent in 2023 from 3.7 per cent in 2020.\n\nHowever, the FDC stated that high debt servicing costs, large public wage bill and security expenses would keep government spending elevated throughout the period.\n\nWith public finances remaining in deficit on lower oil revenues, FDC projected that this would negatively impact the implementation of capital infrastructure projects, like rail and roads, even as debt-servicing costs to revenue will stay above 75 per cent.\n\nIn addition, it stated that inflation would remain stubbornly high, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will remain positive while the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will be more intentional about exchange rate reforms and increasing foreign exchange supply.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assessed his administration\u2019s performances in various sectors of the economy in the outgoing year 2021, declaring that the recovery of the nation\u2019s economy remained on a steady path throughout the year.\n\nBuhari disclosed this in his January 1, 2022 message to Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the President, the country recorded some significant achievements in the year despite the turbulence that characterised the economy.\n\nThe message, obtained by SaharaReporters, partly read, \u201cWe equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n\u201cOn the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterised our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n\u201cThe major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn August 16, 2021, I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n\u201cJust like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n\u201cIn year 2022 and going forward, our administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\u201d\n\nAmidst the President\u2019s claim, the country\u2019s dwindling finances had come under intense pressure as the government is broke and has been amassing foreign loans.\n\nFor example, Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, while doctors were on strike over poor allowance, had in September 2021 confirmed that the Nigerian government under President Muhammadu Buhari borrowed funds from international sources to pay salaries of workers because of a shortfall in the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nNgige had said the government took borrowed funds from foreign institutions like the World Bank to offset some recurrent expenditures.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had in April 2021 admitted that Nigeria\u2019s economy was facing a difficult time, saying borrowing was inevitable.",

After a hide and seek period spanning 21 months (1yr 9 months) between COVID-19 and my humble self, the virus finally caught up with me during the dying days of 2021.\n\n\u201cAfter feeling unwell from 28th December, I decided to do a COVID-19 test yesterday morning.\n\n\u201cThe result came out positive this morning. Currently doing fine, with some sore throat, feverish feeling and mild running nose. Undertaking treatment and isolation at home.\n\n\u201cI salute and wish all the medical personnel in the FCT and beyond who have been in the front line fighting this pandemic a happy and prosperous new year 2022. I pray for the quick recovery of all of us currently afflicted with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI have been informed by the experts that my case is mild because I took two shots of the COVID-19 vaccine. I appeal to all those who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 to do so.

          "text": "We remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. I salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\n3. The persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\n4. The path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. There is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\n6. The net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\n7. Government, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Once again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n9. We equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n10. We remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n11. On the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. The major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n13. We may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n14. Despite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n15. On August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. Just like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n17. In year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\n18. We have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\n19. In the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n20. Despite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\n21. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n22. As it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\n23. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.",

Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\u201d\n\nThe president also said his administration has invested heavily in the firepower needed by the military to fight insecurity, adding that the result is evident in the surrender of hundreds of suspected insurgents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the issue of security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this administration has given utmost attention to.\n\n\u201cAs a follow up to our promise to re-energise and reorganise the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our security forces and continue to do so through various channels and the safe corridor created for that purpose.\u201d",

The outgoing year had its blessings but for many of us it was a hard and difficult one of serious challenges and struggle,\u201d the message reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe entire world continued to be troubled by the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant social and economic woes. Nigeria fought wisely and bravely to prevent the worst of the pandemic from visiting us. We succeeded in great part but we still felt and feel the effects of this unprecedented public health challenge.\n\n\u201cWhile we still contend against this scourge, let us take great solace in one incontestable fact. With relatively few resources, we have contained this disease more than it has contained us. This speaks to the strength and resilience of our national spirit. This episode has shown us that when we put our collective will and energy to a thing, nothing will stop us from our common purpose. Nothing can beat back our pursuit of the common good.\n\n\u201cNo matter what may confront us, God never leaves us bereft of hope or positive solution. It is upon us to find the God-given courage and vision in ourselves to stand up to problems that seek to shackle us that we may bring these problems low. So that we may elevate this nation and its people to a much higher place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI say this not just to say a nice thing during the holiday season. I say this because it is our greater truth. It is our national destiny. In this new year, let us seize that destiny as never before. So I enjoin you to enter 2022 with hope and with the unyielding determination that our hope and collective toil will succeed in bringing forth a more prosperous and just nation. Hope that things will be better.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the President Muhammadu Buhari administration is doing its best to tackle insecurity, and it is up to the citizens to show support.\n\n\u201cInsecurity is here in many areas. But we will battle and battle and battle it again until it is subdued and extinguished from the face of the nation. President Muhammadu Buhari and our security agencies are doing their best to confront the menace. The President has vowed to end this evil. Let\u2019s us join and support him in this common cause regardless of partisan or other affiliation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have an economy to continue to build. Youths in need of jobs. The elderly and the sick in need of care. Infrastructure in need of building. Poverty in need of chasing away. Hunger in need of disappearing. Compassion and care in need of growing. Let us focus on these things. For in achieving these things, we achieve a better Nigeria for us all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI urge Nigerians to continue to be law-abiding, peaceful and most strongly committed to the national project upon which we have embarked and for which so many have toiled and sacrificed. Let us vow in unshakable promise to dedicate this year and our strongest effort to the welfare and progress of our people.\u201d",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs.

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup scene has seen continued progress year on year. After a slight setback in 2020, courtesy of the coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown, activities have resumed as usual \u2014 well, almost.\n\nAs the year ends, we bring you a few memorable moments across the African tech ecosystem, some good and some bad.\n\nMore African investors throw their hats in the ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKola Aina, pioneer founder Ventures Platform fund\n\nFor so long, most of the investment into African startups came from foreign investors. Make no mistake, that is still the case. However, more African investors are springing up and providing much-needed funding for African startups.\n\nThis year saw PiggyVest\u2019s Co-founder, Odunayo Eweniyi team up with Eloho Omame to start FirstCheck, an African firm funding startups founded by women. Seasoned investor and early PiggyVest investor, Olumide Soyombo, launched Voltron Capital; LoftyInc Capital launched its third fund of $10 million. Ventures Platform recently announced the first close of its $40 million fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany founders also invested in startups themselves or as part of a collective, with Flutterwave\u2019s Founder, Olugbenga Agboola; Paystack\u2019s Co-founders, Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi; and Babs Ogundeyi, Founder and CEO of Kuda Bank some of the founders to do so.\n\nAll this points to a better understanding of the dynamics of funding tech startups by local investors and would help support more innovators on the continent. We\u2019re excited to see how this plays out.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crypto ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a broken payment infrastructure, many Nigerians took to cryptocurrencies to navigate global financial systems.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government of Nigeria was having none of it. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria, it issued a circular in February instructing commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions to stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\nThere was a brief period when it seemed users of cryptocurrencies were going to capitulate, but they were only regrouping with peer to peer transactions increasing as a result.\n\nThe year of the unicorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nAs the year started, Africa had only one unicorn. As of December, it now boasts five fintech startups as OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and talent outsourcing company, Andela, joined Interswitch as the continent\u2019s unicorns.\n\nFlutterwave led the way when it raised $170 million in a Series C round in March, bringing its total funding to $225 million.\n\nOPay was the next with a $400 million raise that took its valuation way past the $1 billion mark and made it the fastest African startup to cross the $1 billion valuation mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy September, Andela became the latest unicorn after Softbank led a $200 million Series E round in the talent outsourcing startup. Chipper Cash rounded up the list as Africa\u2019s seventh unicorn raising a $150 million extension round. This followed its $100 million Series C raise in May.\n\nTwitter\u2019s first African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nNigeria\u2019s frequent fight with Ghana continued this year, and this time, it was not over who had the better jollof rice but over Twitter\u2019s decision to set up its first African office in Ghana.\n\nThe decision to set up in Ghana was a surprise to many after comments made by Twitter\u2019s then CTO (now CEO), Parag Agrawal, during a 2019 visit to Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Agrawal commented on the availability of technical talents in Nigeria and impactful public conversations.\n\nThe roles it began hiring for also indicate that the plan might have been to set up in Nigeria with the company listing free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet as its reasons for choosing Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nBuilding a startup in Nigeria means occasionally pulling all-nighters as you try to figure out how to surmount the latest regulatory hurdle. For so long, it has been argued that Nigerian startup founders need to be proactive in their interactions with the government and regulators.\n\nAs a result, some of the country\u2019s most prominent founders and investors came together to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill. The Bill seeks to set a framework of interaction between the Nigerian startup community and the government to enable startups to thrive.\n\nHowever, this is not the first of such initiatives, and few people expressed scepticism about it. However, it seems plans are on track, with TechCabal reporting that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the bill.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether things work better this time around, but we hope they do.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 2, 2021, microblogging platform, Twitter, deleted tweets made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Twitter, the decision resulted from the President\u2019s violation of its abusive behaviour policy.\n\nTwo days later, on June 4, 2021, the federal government responded by banning the use of the microblogging platform in Nigeria, forcing Nigerians to access Twitter using VPNs. Over the next few months, the federal government disclosed a willingness to lift the ban, provided Twitter agreed to some conditions.\n\nIn August, the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, hinted that the ban would be lifted \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d It\u2019s been over four months now, and the ban is still in place.\n\nFrancophone Africa gets its first unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this year, all of Africa\u2019s tech unicorns had been founded in predominantly English speaking countries. But in September, Wave broke that monopoly, becoming the first francophone Africa unicorn. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it came from the fintech sector.\n\nThe startup became a unicorn after it raised $200 million in Africa\u2019s largest Series A round to date. Founded by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, Wave launched in Senegal in 2017, offering free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application while charging users a 1% fee for money transfers.\n\nIts low-cost solution has enabled it to take on more established players in Senegal, with Orange, the country\u2019s largest mobile money operator, reportedly going as far as stopping its Senegalese users from purchasing Orange airtime using Wave\u2019s application.\n\nRecord-breaking rounds for Egyptian startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was the year of Egyptian startups. Last year, startups in the country raised $156 million, but by August 2021, they had eclipsed those figures. As of September, startups in the country had raised over $400 million in 2021.\n\nConsequently, it now rivals Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as the continents top investment destinations.\n\nAlready, the country has one startup valued above $1 billion in Fawry and could have two when Swvl lists publicly. According to Disrupt Africa\u2019s Egyptian Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, this year, Egypt is behind only Nigeria in terms of funding raised by its startups. However, unlike most startup powerhouses on the continent, Egypt\u2019s most prominent startups are in eCommerce instead of fintech.\n\nMainOne\u2019s impending acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunke Opeke. Founder/CEO, MainOne\n\nLast year, telecommunications service provider, MainOne, celebrated its 10th anniversary. This year, reports have emerged that the company is in talks to be acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nIt is fair to say that the news was one few, if any, were expecting as Nigerians made their feelings known on Twitter. A central talking point was the rumoured cost of the transaction, with some of the opinion that the company was underpriced.\n\nHowever, Funke Opeke, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, quashed such suggestions in an interview with TechCrunch. According to her, while MainOne has raised money since its founding, not all of it has been equity raises, with the company also raising debt rounds.\n\nAt $320 million, this is the highest any Nigerian tech company has acquired. Throw in the fact that this is a female-led company, and you can see how impressive it is.\n\nNigeria\u2019s surprising 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s road to getting 5G has thrown up some surprises, but none has been more surprising than one of the recently concluded 5G auction winners \u2014 MAFAB Communications.\n\nUntil the bids were announced, very little was known about MAFAB Communications or its operations. However, it surprisingly beat Airtel to become one of two holders of Nigeria\u2019s 5G licence. For context, the company was only incorporated on July 8, 2020, but managed to edge out older and more established players.\n\nAs we step into the new year, we do so with excitement at what is to come, and we hope you had an amazing year.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween January and September 2021, African fintechs raised up to $1.4 billion, signalling an increasing investor appetite for Africa\u2019s growing fintech space, and Nigeria has taken centre stage.\n\nWhen Paystack and Flutterwave launched in 2016, it was a massive game-changer for Nigeria\u2019s financial sector, enabling thousands of other businesses to receive payments for their services.\n\nSince then, each year has presented an interesting trend as people look to plug different perceived gaps in Nigeria\u2019s financial sector.\n\nAccording to data gathered by Intelligence by Techpoint, Nigerian fintech startups raised almost $800 million in 2021. This was 120% higher than what fintechs raised in the last three years combined ($360.7 million).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, it took the lion\u2019s share of funding across sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this success, our analysis showed that fintechs were merely scratching the surface of financial inclusion in Africa. But, so far, there\u2019ve been massive improvements in the fintech space beyond smartphone apps.\n\nLooking back at 2021, we touch on some notable points, and, once again, we had the honour of discussing the space with Adedeji Olowe, Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nIn January 2021, Olowe made some interesting predictions which, in the real sense, are educated guesses based on the trends from past years, and we created a little analysis.\n\nInterestingly, some predictions came to pass, reminding us that no one sees the future. At least, we haven\u2019t met anyone who does, have you?\n\nWhat did not happen?\n\nVisa and Mastercard to acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, we placed what was perhaps the most daring and exciting prediction front and centre in our analysis of Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions. Visa could acquire Interswitch with Mastercard responding by acquiring eTranzact.\n\nThis obviously did not happen, but several building blocks are in place to make it possible.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Visa invested $200 million in Interswitch, making one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest fintech companies a full-fledged Unicorn. That investment brought several conversations about Visa\u2019s play for the Nigerian market, and that of its biggest competition, Mastercard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth companies have invested in many Nigerian fintechs, most notably Paystack and Flutterwave, and seemingly took their battle for market share to Africa\u2019s shores.\n\n\u201cI made the prediction because I think it made perfect sense for both companies to go through that route, and I think it\u2019s still a possibility in the future,\u201d says Olowe.\n\nMajor banks to implement free transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest selling points Digital banks like Kuda have used to take the market by storm is free transfers. Unfortunately, no major bank took up the gauntlet to implement free bank transfers in 2021.\n\nAccording to Olowe, giving free transfers for transactions below a certain amount would greatly aid Nigeria\u2019s drive for a cashless society. This, he says, would bring in several people performing low-value transactions daily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something the CBN should push for. Over 20 years ago, a SIM card cost \u20a620,000, but now it\u2019s completely free. Today, some people don\u2019t mind buying \u20a650 recharge cards ten times in a day, but tell them to load \u20a6500 at once,\u201d he states.\n\nOlowe believes that once a cap is set, it would be very helpful and will not be abused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling people to send their own hard-earned money. Even if it\u2019s free, It won\u2019t be so easy. If the accounts are linked with the BVN, then it would be easier to catch those who might want to abuse the policy,\u201d he argues.\n\nCould we see another game-changing CBN circular soon? Let\u2019s watch out.\n\nMonthly inter-bank transactions to hit $500 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral fintech stalwarts tout Nigeria\u2019s payment sector as one of the fastest globally. This was made possible by the introduction of the NIBSS Instant Payment by the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System. This speed, as well as several other factors like increasing Internet penetration, has increased monthly inter-bank transactions in recent years.\n\nAs of December 2020, the numbers had almost hit $300 million, but so far, in 2021, it hasn\u2019t come close to $500 million.\n\nAccording to data from the NIBSS, the average monthly inter-bank transactions stayed a little over $250 million for the better part of 2021, finally crossing $300 million in October and November.\n\n\u201cTransactions will likely go up during the festive season, but I doubt it will hit $400 million.\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason that free inter-bank transfers could encourage more inter-bank transactions, but it might not always be so straightforward. Let\u2019s watch out for any triggers in 2022.\n\nWhatsApp to make a payment play in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, all it would have taken was a virtual account attached to every WhatsApp number, and that would have been a game-changer, Olowe opined in January 2021. However, WhatsApp payment struggled to lift off during the year.\n\nIts launch in Brazil met with stiff opposition, and regulatory parties all but quelled any traction it plans to gain. However, the team at Meta-owned WhatsApp is not deterred, and it announced a relaunch in Brazil and testing in the United States in December 2021.\n\nOlowe believes they\u2019re not out yet, stating that future developments would most likely tie in with Meta\u2019s recent crypto play.\n\nImagine being able to make transactions from a crypto wallet in your WhatsApp account. That would be something, don\u2019t you think?\n\nSignificant progress\n\nThe growth and relevance of agency banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency banking burst onto the scene in 2020 with the reported successes of OPay and TeamApt. In 2021, it grew to unprecedented levels as more players like Kudi and Paga began to show immense growth in Agency banking services.\n\nOlowe predicted that Agency banking locations would surpass one million. Though we tried collating data from different players, this could amount to double-counting as most agents are company agnostic. So we\u2019ll try to lay our hands on official data.\n\nIn January, Olowe argued that if KYC issues were resolved, most agents would be able to perform services such as offering loans, customer KYC verification, e-commerce deliveries, and other non-cash transactions.\n\nThis idea has not been fully realised, but some of the players in the space have made some significant strides.\n\nTeamApt, OPay, and Paga, for example, offer bill payments and other social services, but a little talked about company, Kudi, has struck some interesting initiatives.\n\nIn August 2021, it revealed a partnership with Aella App and Reliance HMO to allow customers access loans and health insurance through their network of agents.\n\nYou see, mobile money providers do not have the licence to provide loans or insurance, but that\u2019s where Aella comes in to provide loans to customers, and Reliance comes in for health insurance.\n\nAccording to Nifemi Akinwamide, Head of Marketing at Kudi, the goal is to bring millions of Nigerians who are offline into the financial market, and such a partnership would help Aella and Reliance reach thousands of people who do not have smartphones.\n\nThis deserves a closer look, and its success might help make this prediction get a more favourable outcome in 2022\n\nWhat happened\n\nMTN finally got its PSB licence\n\nIn January, Olowe stated that MTN would finally get its PSB licence, and he based his prediction on the fact that Karl Toriola, MTN\u2019s CEO, who has a history of execution, would make it happen.\n\nAt the MTN anniversary event, we tried getting some juice from Toriola, but he simply stated that the company had completed all the requirements and was waiting for the CBN\u2019S final decision.\n\nIn November 2021, MTN and Airtel finally received approval in principle (AIP) to operate as a payment service bank in Nigeria. They joined 9mobile and Glo that got the AIP in 2019.\n\nWhile a telco-driven mobile money operation has worked wonders in Kenya and Ghana, it has not hit the mark in Nigeria.\n\nMost mobile money providers use PoS machines that require cards and mainly deal with cash, but a telco-led mobile money could make things completely cashless.\n\n\u201cAn AIP gives many financial institutions the power to operate fully. They\u2019re basically telling you to put actions behind all you\u2019ve been boasting that your company would do. They\u2019ll then come back in a few years to see that everything is functioning well.\n\n\u201cI must admit that MTN would find it really tough to play in the financial space. They would have two regulators, the NCC and the CBN, and would experience what banks and other fintechs have been facing in the space,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHowever, he also insists that MTN has a track record of execution, and they would come with the right strategy to take the market.\n\nMTN is the largest telecom company in terms of network coverage, voice subscribers, and Internet subscribers, and the launch of its PSB could bode well for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nVirtual accounts are coming of age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe predicted that virtual accounts, led by innovators from TeamApt, Rubies, Zenith, Sterling, Wema, and Sparkle would become increasingly popular.\n\nSo far, most of these fintech companies have led the charge as predicted, but not without a few hiccups.\n\nWhen the CBN banned crypto transactions in March 2021, it placed sanctions on Providus Bank, which enabled virtual accounts for several fintech companies playing in the crypto space.\n\nHowever, the issues have since been resolved, and Olowe states that activities have resurged to the levels attained just before the crypto ban.\n\nLocal investors are stepping up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports from previous years showed that foreign investments have dominated funding for Nigerian startups, and Olowe predicted that this would change with the FOMO caused by Paystack\u2019s acquisition in 2020.\n\nRecall that Stripe acquired Paystack in 2020 for $200 million, a truly momentous milestone for Africa\u2019s startup scene.\n\nIn 2021, there\u2019s been a massive improvement in the participation of local investors, but differently than expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that several Nigerian investors don\u2019t really understand the business of startups. They think it\u2019s just, \u2018Put your money and expect constant returns.\u2019 What we\u2019re now seeing is startup founders who truly understand the space funding upcoming founders,\u201d Olowe points out.\n\nRecent funding rounds have featured the likes of GB, Flutterwave CEO; Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, Paystack\u2019s Co-founders; Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda CEO, and other notable names.\n\nOlowe, however, maintains that Nigeria has boasted a good number of local investors in recent years. Most notable are Gbenga Oyebode, Founder of Aluko and Oyebode, one of MTN\u2019s first supporters in Nigeria.\n\nOther names like Idris Ayobello and Olumide Soyombo also warrant significant mention.\n\nAccording to Olowe, the successes of three investors has created FOMO among their peers who are getting more interested in the startup space.\n\nIt was a bright year for fintech companies and a year of Unicorns. What do you expect to see in 2022? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others. Our programmes, reforms and initiatives are targeted at improving the quality of life and placing them at the centre of our politics. The vituperations of APC and their minions will never in any way derail this sacred mandate given freely by the majority of Edo people in September last year.\n\nAndrew Emwanta JP\n\nCommissioner for Communication and Orientation, Edo State\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n...",

          "title": "For the Record: Text of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s New Year Speech",
          "text": "PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI\u2019S STATEMENT TO THE NATION ON JANUARY 1, 2022\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous Nation of our dream.\n\n2. I salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\n3. The persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\n4. The path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n5. There is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\n6. The net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\n7. Government, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\n8. Once again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n9. We equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n10. We remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n11. On the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n12. The major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n13. We may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n14. Despite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n15. On August 16, 2021 I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n16. Just like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n17. In year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\n18. We have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\n19. In the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\n20. Despite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\n21. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n22. As it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\n23. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

The party must remain a strong political entity before, during and after the convention\u201d, he stated in a new year message he personally signed.\n\nSani scored the governing party high in terms of political exploits in the previous year saying it was a bountiful 2021, with a harvest of some governors and other political bigwigs from other parties.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish to acknowledge the exploits of the leadership of our great party, All Progressives Congress (APC), under His Excellency Mai Mala Buni, the governor of Yobe State, under whose administration the party has continued to grow in leaps and bounds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe should not forget the bigger challenge ahead of us in 2023, the presidential election. We cannot go into it divided neither can we win the trophy in such a state. We should all uphold the ideals of the party this new year as we journey into the national convention.\u201d\n\nHe also applauded the Buhari administration which he said recorded many successes in spite of daunting challenges, noting that economic and security problems are global issues that are not just limited to Nigeria alone.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe APC administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari has also recorded many successes in spite of doubting challenges, especially the dwindling resources available to the government, and security issues confronting our dear country.\n\n\u201cWhile it is important to note that economic and security problems are global issues, I commend President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s ingenuity at navigating them and I call on every Nigerian to support him in the new year so that the efforts of his administration can yield desirable success.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe ingenuity of our dear president led to the country\u2019s domestic growth in the first three quarters of 2021, recording real GDP of 0.51 percent in Q1, 5.01 percent in Q2 and 4.03 percent in Q3 2021. This was an improvement from a declining performance in the first three quarters of 2020 (which led to economic recession) put at 1.87 percent in Q1, -6.10 percent in Q2 and -3.62 percent in Q3 2020. Nevertheless, the fourth quarter 2020 recorded a slight improvement of 0.11 percent, ushering in positive growth rates in the three quarters of 2021.\n\n\u201cThis economic performance in 2021 shows a steady improvement in growth over the last three quarters of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe military deserves our continued support, let us appreciate their sacrifice.\n\nThe Buhari-led administration has continued to support them and has assured us the raging insecurity will soon be nipped in the bud. I call on all and sundry to be optimistic in this pledge.\n\n\u201cThrough a number of various operations set up across the country including the Joint Task Force (JTF) North East, tagged Operation HADIN KAI covering theNorth East region; the JTF SS, tagged Operation DELTA SAFE covering the South South region; the JTF NW, known as Operation HADARIN DAJIcovering the North West region; Operation SAFE HAVEN covering Plateau, parts of Kaduna and Bauchi States; Operation WHIRL STROKE covering Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba States; JTF SW, referred to as Operation AWATSE and covering Lagos and Ogun States; Operation THUNDER STRIKE covering Abuja-Kaduna Highway and Operation WHIRL PUNCH covering parts of Kaduna State, the military has recorded successes in its approach.

What this means is that we are now choosing to capture in the Budget the significant value already accruing to the State from these projects.\n\n\u201cAs I said during the presentation to the House of Assembly, this will be the last full-year budget in the tenure of this administration. As a result, a major focus of this budget will be ensuring the completion of all ongoing projects that are critical to achieving our desire to build a Greater Lagos in line with the goals and objectives of the T.H.E.M.E.S development agenda.\u201d\n\nHe said the Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Mr. Sam Egube would present to the public the full details and breakdown of the budget in due course.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu also commended the Speaker and members of the Lagos State House of Assembly for their cooperation and support, especially in ensuring the quick consideration and passage of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, which he presented on Wednesday, November 24.\n\nThe Governor also appreciated Lagosians for their support in ensuring the impressive performance in the implementation of the 2021 budget, against all odds, especially the continuous challenge posed by COVID 19.\n\n\u201cI believe very strongly that we, working together, and with everyone doing their part diligently, will achieve much more in 2022,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudasiru Obasa, stated that the budget was given expeditious approval with proper scrutiny within five weeks to ensure that all projects are executed.\n\nObasa, who was represented by the Chairman of the Lagos State House of Assembly Committee on Appropriation, Hon. Gbolahan Yishawu, said the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration is heading in the right direction in ensuring that infrastructural projects are put in place across the state in line with the T.H.E.M.E.S. development agenda.\n\nHe also commended Governor Sanwo-Olu for completing all the projects he inherited and providing funds for all the ongoing projects in different parts of the State.\n\nAlso speaking, Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Sam Egube, commended the Lagos State House of Assembly for the speedy passage of the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nHe said he was excited and grateful to all stakeholders for leading the process to the signing of the biggest State\u2019s budget.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Lagos State House of Assembly on Wednesday passed the 2022 budget estimates with a slight increase of the grand total from the initial N1.38 trillion to N1.758 trillion.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "After signing, Buhari accuses National Assembly of padding 2022 budget",
          "text": "Flanked by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, the Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila as well and Zainab Ahmed, his Minister of Finance and other top government officials, President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill as well as the enabling 2021 Finance Bill into law.\n\nThe President said he signed the Bill into law despite his reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly made to the Executive proposal to enable its implementation to commence on 1st January 2022 as has been the tradition for some years now.\n\n\u201cThis Administration remains committed to the early presentation of the annual appropriation bill to the National Assembly to ensure its passage before the beginning of the fiscal year,\u201d the President promised as he signed the Budget with aggregate expenditures of N17.127 trillion, an increase of N735.85 billion over the initial Executive Proposal for a total expenditure of N16.391 trillion to law.\n\nThe President noted that he approved the increase of the budget proposal by N186.53 billion to cover expected expenditure on additional critical expenditures and he consequently authorized the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to forward the request for the increase to the National Assembly.\n\nAside this, the President noted that the lawmakers mutilated and padded the original 2022 Executive Budget proposal with insertions of new projects, outright removals of others, as well as reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\nFor one, Buhari noted that the lawmakers increased the revenue expected for funding of the budget by N400 billion without indicating where the additional money will come from.\n\nAlso, the lawmakers reduced the amount allocated to sinking fund for retiring of Bonds that will mature by N22 billion without any explanation\n\nThe President also said the lawmakers reduced the amount set aside for payment of Non-Regular Allowances of the Police and the Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively, an action he described as worrisome \u201cbecause personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances.\u201d\n\nThe President also noted that the lawmakers unilaterally increased overhead allocations to some ministries, departments and agencies, MDAs of government by N21.72 billion, while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification.\n\nBuhari also noted that while National Assembly increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion, it went ahead to reduce allocation for some some critical projects.\n\nSome of the critical projects that suffered the perfidy of the lawmakers include the Ministry of Transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing Rail Modernisation with the allocation reduced by N12.6 billion, reduction of N25.8 billion from Power Sector Reform Programme under the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, and reduction of N14.5 billion from several projects of the Ministry of Agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this Ministry and its agencies.\n\nOn the contrary, President Buhari noted that members of the National Assembly included new provisions totaling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly reduced allocations for as many as 10,733 projects in the 2022 budget, while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\nThe President noted that the lawmakers reduced provisions for many strategic capital projects in favour of their own \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects to the detriment of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u201cMost of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments, and do not appear to have been properly conceptualized, designed and costed.\n\n\u201cMany more projects have been added to the budgets of some MDAs with no consideration for the institutional capacity to execute the additional projects and/or for the incremental recurrent expenditure that may be required,\u201d the President noted.\n\nBuhari also lamented that while the National Assembly increased projected revenue by N609.27 billion, the additional Executive request of N186.53 billion for critical expenditure items could not be accommodated without increasing the deficit, while the sum of N550.59 billion from the projected incremental revenues was allocated at the discretion of National Assembly.\n\nConsequently,the President Buhari said while he signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to enable its implementation to commence on 1st January 2022, he will revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment and/or virement as soon as lawmakers resume from their yuletide break.\n\nThis, he said he will do to ensure that critical ongoing projects that are cardinal to his administration, and those nearing completion, do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\nBy Ayorinde Oluokun",

ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU in this report writes on the persistent killings and amidst the unending war against the unfortunate incident.\n\nInvestigations\n\nIndeed, there are no signs that the wanton killings across the country will abate soon given the total number of citizens, others murdered by non-state actors in the last 12 months.\n\nThe investigations by HumAngle, SBM Intelligence, Enough is Enough EiE Nigeria, which Blueprint Weekend reviewed revealed that over 9, 500 Nigerians were killed by Boko Haram terrorists, armed herdsmen, bandits and gunmen across all parts of the country. According to data analysed by HumAngle, nearly 6,000 lives were lost to insecurity between January 1 and June 30, 2021.\n\nThe Report disclosed that Nigeria Security Tracker (NST), which collects information on violence cases in the country, estimated based on media publications that at least 5,838 people were killed and 2,944 others kidnapped over the six-month period. The killings and abductions of citizens were recorded in the country\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nAmong those killed within the period were 2,897 civilians and 499 security officials.\n\nThe figures reflect the shifts in the dynamics of the security challenges besetting the country as the most vulnerable region has now become the North-west where 1,976 people were killed, followed by the North-east where Boko Haram factions operate, which had 1,453 fatalities, then the North-central region (1,103), South- east 575, then South-south 408 and then the South-west 323.\n\nAlso, between July 1 and September 30, 2021, the SBM Intelligence and EiE Nigeria Report showed that over 2,287 people were killed in Nigeria in violent incidents, including attacks by Boko Haram terrorists, militia herdsmen, bandits, abductions and gangsterism.\n\nIt indicated further that 1, 153 civilians were killed followed by bandits at 675 and terrorists at 170. The casualties on the part of law enforcement agents were 105 soldiers, 67 police members and 2 immigration officers.\n\nIn total, no fewer than 176 security personnel lost their lives to attacks in different parts of the country. The Report also stated that 29 members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) were killed during the period.\n\nIn particular, Zamfara state had the highest reported killing with 495, followed by Niger state at 306; Borno state at 285 and Kaduna state at 259. Plateau state recorded 138 killings; Benue at 113 and Katsina at 107.\n\nThe North-west had the most reported killings at 961, followed by the North- central at 102, and the North-east at 336. The Southern casualties were led by the South-east at 137, the South-south at 105 and 102 for the South-west.\n\nFurthermore, according to data gathered by the Nigeria Security Tracker (NST) 725 were killed across Nigeria in October alone due to dire security situations. The highest number of deaths was recorded in Borno, followed by Kaduna, Niger, Sokoto, and Zamfara states.\n\nThe analysis done by HumAngle further showed that the killings took place across 28 of the country\u2019s 37 states (including the federal capital territory). A total of 148 violent incidents were recorded during the period.\n\nNotably, the NST data showed that among those killed were 272 civilians and 69 security personnel. One hundred and eighty-five (185) Boko Haram members, 198 armed persons, seven kidnappers, and two robbers were also killed.\n\nIn October 2021, the highest number of deaths was recorded in Borno, with 151 casualties, followed by Kaduna (97), Niger (93), Sokoto (80), and Zamfara (74).\n\nThe greatest death toll for one incident was recorded on Sunday, October 17, during a terror attack at Goronyo market, Sokoto in the North-west. Residents said the terrorists had arrived in tens of motorcycles and indiscriminately opened fire on traders and buyers, killing up to 49 people.\n\nReviews\n\nA review of the security situation by this reporter relying on media reports showed that no fewer than 535 were killed from November 1 till date. It added that 29 military officers, 18 policemen, 388 Nigerians and 101 others were gruesomely murdered across the country during the period.\n\nAn incident was recorded on November 15 when marauders attacked Illela local government area of Sokoto state in the wee hours killing 13 people in the first instance. And the death toll rose to 43 after a few hours. Another attack was recorded on December 20, 2021, when at least 45 people were killed in renewed hostilities in Lafia, Obi and Awe local government areas of Nasarawa state.\n\nIn another development, the death toll from the attacks on communities in Giwa local government area of Kaduna state reportedly rose to 40, following the discovery of two corpses in the bush by security operatives.\n\nCumulatively, the perpetrators of the killings which included Boko Haram terrorists, armed herdsmen, bandits and gunmen claimed 6,000 lives between January 1 and June 30, 2021, then between July 1 and September 30, 2021, over 2,287 were killed, in October 725 were killed across Nigeria and no fewer than 535 were killed from November 1 till date.\n\nPDP\u2019s chair\u2019s take\n\nIn his reaction, the national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prof Iyorchia Ayu, lamented the intractable banditry, killings and kidnappings ravaging the country, saying \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the country seems to be in a war situation.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are virtually in a war situation in Nigeria today. We are fighting bandits. We are fighting kidnappers; we are fighting all sorts of bandits and extremists who are killing raping our mothers and daughters. None of you can sleep with your eye open or closed because you are always wondering whether you are going to make it to the next day. You have to keep on highlighting these problems because the government has the fundamental responsibility of protecting lives and property.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk as a political party or as an opposition, but you know exactly what is happening in our country is threatening even the very unity and existence of our country. I think you need accurate reporting of the events, which are not very glorious.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts\u2019 views\n\nMeanwhile, security experts have identified the vulnerability of national structures, centralised nature of security agriculture and unseriousness on the part of the government among others as the reasons the killings have continued.\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend on telephone, a security expert, Dr. Kabir Adamu, said the killing persist \u201cbecause of the vulnerability within our nation structures; especially the centralised nature of our security and the inability to address the drivers of insecurity at the villages, local government and other levels; this has allowed non-state actors to continue to perpetuate their activities.\n\nAlso, in an interview with this reporter, a golden member of the International Security Association (IWA), Switzerland, Jackson Lekan Ojo, said, \u201cKillings continue due to the carelessness of the government in the past and of today.\n\n\u201cWhat we call Boko Haram suddenly reared its ugly head in this country and it was handled with levity. At the end of the day it spread from Borno state, where they hoisted their flag in 13 local government areas, and then entered Yobe, Gombe, Adamawa, Kano and most of the northern states.\n\n\u201cBefore you knew it, they had created a department that raised funds for their atrocities. And because of the International connection and the political connection within Nigeria they created another group which we nick-named bandits. When they came, they killed many people, yet we still refer to them as bandits.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cInstead of the government to rally round and deal decisively with these people, they were pampered. So, when they saw how some governors were pampering them, some of the bandits spread across Zamfara state to Kaduna state, to Niger state and recently they terrorised four local government areas in Sokoto.\n\n\u201cSome state governments pampered them, the government left them and they became untouchable. Today no bandits have been arrested and prosecuted and we even know the names of bandits\u2019 leaders. The bandits\u2019 leaders are wanted, military and other security agencies could not locate where they were, but Sheikh Ahmed Gumi visited them and told Nigerians what the bandits wanted. Gumi is still a free man today.\n\n\u201cRecently, they were declared terrorists by a competent court in Abuja and all of us were very happy, but almost a month after that the court declaration, it\u2019s not been gazetted by the federal government. And that is why you hear and read about the killing on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nSolution\n\nOn how to end the killings, Dr. Adam said: \u201cThese insecurity issues across all states in Nigeria vary. It is difficult to think of short-term and immediate remedies, but there is nothing that will go beyond good governance and accountability by those in government.\n\n\u201cIn other words, how do we make sure that those that have the responsibility to protect us do so? And when they don\u2019t, they are either fired or some measure of accountability be seen. In this instance, I am shocked that after the incident in Sokoto, Kaduna and Nasarawa states not a single government official has been held accountable.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way of changing the tide is to enhance accountability. The best way to protect lives is to ensure that all the 37 agencies and parastatal that are involved in security are charged to live up to their expectation and the constitutional responsibilities that they have. And the best way to do that is to hold the leadership of these agencies accountable.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ojo is of the view that, \u201cWe must be decisive, just like the governor of Kaduna state, Nasir el Rufa\u2019i, said. According to him, these people should be exterminated and sent to their creator. Although the call is coming a bit late, it is still very potent. If our security agencies go to their hideouts in the forests and flush them out and kill them, I think it will serve as a deterrent. But without setting these deterrents, they will have the courage like we are witnessing today to continue to kill.\u201d\n\nPresidency\u2019s disclosures, assurances\n\nSpeaking from the Presidency, the senior special assistant to the president on media and publicity, Garba Shehu, gave the assurance that President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cwill tackle all security challenges confronting the country head-on.\u201d\n\nShehu, in a recent statement to celebrate President Buhari\u2019s 79th birthday and achievement in office, noted that \u201cPresident\u2019s determination is to end all the conflicts to keep citizens safe.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that, \u201cThe APC government led by Buhari has been challenged by the worrisome activities of bandits, now classified as terrorists, and the incidents of attacks on communities especially that which pitches farmers against herders. Both have had the combined effect of disturbing the nation\u2019s social fabric.\u201d\n\nShehu, however, disclosed that, \u201cThe government has a two-pronged strategy in dealing with the clashes: one by addressing immediate security and then dealing with scarcity of land. Additional police and military units have been deployed to the affected states to address the former. They have already had some noticeable successes against militia groups.\n\n\u201cBut the increased presence will also enable quicker response to distress calls to prevent attacks before they happen.\n\n\u201cThe national livestock transformation plan remedies this through a phased transition from herding to ranching. This shall allow both parties to recognise for themselves the solution, rather than having it thrust upon them. Notably, a majority of the states \u2013 which control land \u2013 and the major farmer and herder associations have welcomed the initiative.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram which is now reduced to a shell of its former self now holds no territory and not a single militant incident have been recorded for years in the Niger Delta. Of course, there is still more to do, but the president\u2019s determination is to end all the conflicts to keep citizens safe.\u201d",

          "title": "Revealed! What Buhari told government officials moment he signed 2022 budget into law",
          "text": "In keeping with the tradition of restoring a predictable January to December fiscal year, as provided for in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari Friday in Abuja signed into law the 2022 Appropriation Bill and the 2021 Finance Bill.\n\nThe President signed the documents in the Presidential Villa in the presence of Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and other members of the Federal Executive Council.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the President said the 2022 Budget, just signed into law, provides for aggregate expenditures of N17.127 trillion, an increase of N735.85 billion over the initial Executive Proposal for a total expenditure of N16.391 trillion.\n\nHe said N186.53 billion of the increase however came from additional critical expenditures that he had authorised the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to forward to the National Assembly.\u2018\u2018The Minister will provide the public with the details of the budget as passed by the National Assembly, and signed into law by me,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe said as the 2023 Budget is going to be a transition budget, work will start in earnest to ensure early submission of the 2023-2025 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper as well as the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n\nThe President directed Heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, more specifically with the Budget Office of the Federation, to realise this very important objective.\n\nThe President also expressed reservations over the \u2018\u2018worrisome changes\u2019\u2019 made by the National Assembly to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal, saying he would revert to the lawmakers with a request for amendment as soon as they resume to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to this administration do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\nThe President recounted that during the presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, he had stated that the fiscal year 2022 would be very crucial in his administration\u2019s efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects, as well as improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal.\n\n\u2018\u2018Some of the worrisome changes are as follows: Increase in projected FGN Independent Revenue by N400 billion, the justification for which is yet to be provided to the Executive;\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion without any explanation; Reduction of the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is particularly worrisome because personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances; Furthermore, an increase of N21.72 billion in the Overhead budgets of some MDAs, while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification;\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also expressed concern in the reductions in provisions for some critical projects, including N12.6 billion in the Ministry of Transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing Rail Modernisation projects; N25.8 billion from Power Sector Reform Programme under the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning; N14.5 billion from several projects of the Ministry of Agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this Ministry and its agencies.\n\nThe President also expressed concern over \u2018\u2018inclusion of new provisions totaling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote,\u201d which he said \u201cnegates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u2018The changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects were reduced while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments, and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed and costed.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many more projects have been added to the budgets of some MDAs with no consideration for the institutional capacity to execute the additional projects and/or for the incremental recurrent expenditure that may be required,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it was surprising that despite the National Assembly increasing projected revenue by N609.27 billion, the additional executive request of N186.53 billion for critical expenditure items could not be accommodated without increasing the deficit, while the sum of N550.59 billion from the projected incremental revenues was allocated at the discretion of National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018I signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to enable its implementation to commence on 1st January 2022.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, I will revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment and/or virement as soon as the Assembly resumes to ensure that critical ongoing projects that are cardinal to this administration, and those nearing completion, do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding,\u201d he said.\n\nOn COVID-19 and budget implementation, the President said despite the lingering adverse effects of the pandemic, he was happy with the success recorded in the implementation of the 2021 Budget.\n\n\u2018\u2018The sum of N3.94 trillion that was provided for the implementation of capital projects by MDAs during the fiscal year has been released fully.\n\n\u2018\u2018To enable MDAs to complete the implementation of their 2021 capital projects and optimise the impact of the capital budget on the economy, they have been allowed to continue to expend the funds released for their 2021 capital budgets till 31st March, 2022,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President commended the understanding and speedy action of the National Assembly on this matter.\n\n\u2018\u2018As the 2022 Budget will be the last full year budget to be implemented by our Administration, its effective implementation is very critical for delivering our legacy projects, promoting social inclusion and strengthening the resilience of the economy.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning will implement all measures required to ensure timely and targeted release of capital votes.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018All MDAs are to effect early commencement of project implementation, while ensuring productive use of funds provided for achievement of the objectives set for their sectors.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the incidence of new COVID-19 variants globally, we will ensure timely implementation of measures provided for in the 2022 Budget to contain the spread of the virus and protect our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018We continue to count on the collaboration of the State governments in our effort to protect the lives and livelihood of our people,\u201d he said.\n\nTo achieve the laudable objectives of the 2022 Budget, the President pledged that the federal government would further intensify revenue mobilisation efforts.\n\nHe expressed optimism in the ability of the Government to finance the budget considering the positive global oil market outlook and the continuing improvement in non-oil revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2018To achieve our revenue targets, revenue generating agencies, and indeed all MDAs must ensure prompt and full remittance of collected revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2018Relevant Agencies must also ensure the realisation of our crude oil production and export targets.\n\n\u2018\u2018I also appeal to our fellow citizens and the business community at large to fulfil their tax obligations promptly.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, being a deficit budget, the specific Borrowing Plan will be forwarded to the National Assembly shortly.\n\n\u2018\u2018I count on the cooperation of the National Assembly for a quick consideration and approval of the Plan when submitted. All borrowings will be judiciously utilised and invested in our future growth and prosperity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also directed MDAs to liaise with the Bureau of Public Enterprises and/or the Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission to explore available opportunities for public-private partnerships, concessions as well as climate finance arrangements to fast-track the pace of infrastructural development.\n\nHe thanked the Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning, the Budget Office of the Federation, and all who worked tirelessly and sacrificed so much towards producing the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u2018\u2018Let me conclude by commending the understanding, sacrifice and resilience of our people during these challenging times.\n\n\u2018\u2018As a Government, we remain committed to improving the general living conditions of our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will continue to implement measures aimed at moderating the unintended negative effects of policies on the citizenry,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "The federal government on Friday announced extension of the ongoing National Identification Number (NIN) verification, being mandatory aspect for existing and new Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards.\n\nThe existing verification exercise is meant to expire on December 31, 2021.\n\nHowever, in a joint press statement on Friday in Abuja, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) said, \u201cThe Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) FBCS, FNCS, FIIM, wishes to convey the approval of the Federal Government to further extend the deadline for the National Identification Number (NIN)-Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) data verification to the 31st of March, 2022.Advertisment\n\n\u201cThe stakeholders have applauded the Federal Government on the significant growth in the number of NIN enrolments and the increased drive to enlighten Nigerians and legal residents across the country. As of 30th December 2021, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued over seventy-one million (71m) NINs with over fourteen thousand (14,000) enrolment centres set up across the country.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has also set up enrolment centres in over thirty-one (31) countries to cater for Nigerians in the Diaspora. The unprecedented growth in the National Identity Database to over 71 million unique NINs in such a short period, with about 3 to 4 SIMs linked to a NIN, reflects the concerted effort of the Federal Government, the Nigerian populace and legal residents and this is truly commendable.Advertisment\n\n\u201cFollowing the request by stakeholders, including citizens, legal residents and Nigerians in the diaspora, the Federal Government has extended the deadline of the exercise to the 31st of March, 2022. This extension would enable the Federal Government to consolidate the gains of the process and accelerate the enrolment of Nigerians in key areas like the remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centres, and the registration of legal residents.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister has however implored Nigerians and legal residents to enrol for their NINs and link with their SIMs during this period of extension as more services will be requiring the NIN for identification. He also reiterated the commitment of the Federal Government to support the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) in ensuring that the objectives of the exercise are achieved.Advertisment\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister, the Executive Vice Chairman/CEO of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, and the Director-General/CEO of NIMC, Engr. Aliyu A. Aziz, on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria, wish to thank all Nigerians and stakeholders for their commitment and support towards the success of the project.

          "title": "Expect Continued Progress Against Our Challenges In New Year, Buhari Tells Nigerians",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has asked Nigerians to envision a year of continued progress against the nation\u2019s combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\nHe gave the charge on Friday in his New Year message to Nigerians to usher in the year 2022.\n\nThe President also urged the people, irrespective of their religious and political affiliation, to come together in the fight to keep the country united against all odds.\n\nREAD ALSO: World Ushers In 2022 After Another Pandemic-Ridden Year\n\nHe admitted that the persistent insecurity in parts of the country may have threatened the overall objective of his administration to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress.\n\nPresident Buhari, however, assured that the government would remain resolute in its commitments and would continue to press ahead with its programmes and plans.\n\nTo achieve this, he stressed that standing together against all odds, was by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to highlight some of the efforts made so far by his administration, and what Nigerians should expect in the areas of security, economy, and anti-corruption fight, among others.\n\nRead the full text of President Buhari\u2019s New Year message below:\n\nWe remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet another Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determination to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous nation of our dream.\n\n2. I salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to restore the global economy and social order.\n\n3. The persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the economy and in the administration\u2019s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible trajectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans.\n\n4. The path to nationhood is often fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resilience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, standing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ultimately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.\n\n5. There is no doubt that the issue of Security remains at the front burner of priority areas that this Administration has given utmost attention to. As a follow up to our promise to re-energize and reorganize the security apparatus and personnel of the armed forces and the police, it is on record that this Administration has invested heavily in re-equipping our military in line with upgrading the platforms and firepower required to tackle the current challenges being faced in the country.\n\n6. The net results of these efforts have been the number of insurgents and bandits who have willingly surrendered to our Security Forces and continue to do so through various channels and the Safe Corridor created for that purpose.\n\n7. Government, however, realizes that victory on the battlefield is just one aspect of sustainable victory. We know that to fully win this war, we must also win the peace and real security lies in winning the hearts and minds of the affected citizens. To this end, working with our international partners and neighbouring countries, we would be deploying multi-faceted solutions that will be targeted at addressing human security at the grassroots, before it leads to insecurity.\n\n8. Once again I would like to take a moment to remember and honour the gallant Military, Police Officers, and other security agents who have lost their lives in the cause of protecting the territorial integrity of this Nation against both internal and external aggressors, assuring their families that their sacrifices would not be in vain.\n\n9. We equally remember and commiserate with Nigerians who have lost loved ones as a result of insecurity in different parts of the country. Every life matters and every single death caused by any form of insecurity is a matter of personal concern to me both as a citizen and as the President of this great country.\n\n10. We remain fully committed to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect all Nigerians from any form of internal and external aggression.\n\n11. On the economy, we have shown a high level of resilience to record some significant achievements despite the turbulence that has characterized our economy and indeed the global economy. The lessons we have learned and keep learning from COVID-19 have encouraged us to intensify efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects on our Nation.\n\n12. The major wins we have recorded can be clearly seen in Nigeria\u2019s most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The 4.03% growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021 is indicative of the recovery being recorded in our economy and the confidence that is being shown through the policies that our Administration has put in place after the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n13. We may also recall that this recent growth is closely followed by the 5.1% (year on year) growth in real terms recorded by Nigeria in Quarter 2 of 2021. This growth was one of the best recorded by any nation across Sub-Saharan Africa. The 5.1% growth at that time was and remains the highest growth recorded by the Nigerian economy since 2014.\n\n14. Despite the challenges we have faced as a Nation, the good news is that we have so far recorded four consecutive quarters of growth after the negative growth rates recorded in Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2020 due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n15. On August 16, 2021, I signed the landmark Petroleum Industry Act into law. The signing of this legacy legislation is a watershed moment in the history of our Nation, considering the massive positive impact the new Act would have on the economy. I would like to sincerely commend the 9th Assembly for the grit they demonstrated, succeeding where others have failed, and the cooperation that led to the completion of this process after almost two decades.\n\n16. Just like I stated during the investment trips and fora that I have attended recently, the legislation is expected to serve as a liberalizing force in the energy industry, and we are optimistic that this law will provide the much-needed legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the development of the energy sector, the host communities, and Nigeria as a Nation. Our objective to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market is still very much at the forefront of some of the policies we would be pushing in the new year.\n\n17. In year 2022 and going forward, our Administration would intentionally leverage ICT platforms to create jobs, while ensuring that the diversification of our economy creates more support to other emerging sectors. I am proud to announce that several foreign investors are taking advantage of our ranking as one of the leading start-up ecosystems in Africa to invest in our digital economy.\n\n18. We have given the utmost priority to fighting corruption and other related offenses which have been a bane to the growth and prosperity of our dear Nation. We have made major strides and breakthroughs through the innovative use of technology and forensics in the investigative and prosecutorial procedures with commendable results to show that the anti-corruption drive of our Administration is succeeding.\n\n19. In the meantime, the accomplishments that have been recorded so far can be traced to the dedication of the Nation\u2019s anti-corruption Agencies who have received the necessary support needed to effectively prosecute their duties.\n\n20. Despite our challenges in 2021, it was also a year in which the Administration executed successfully, key projects, programmes, and initiatives to fulfil the promises made under the Security, Economy Anti-corruption (SEA) agenda.\n\n21. As we welcome 2022, let us, with hope, envision a year of continued progress against our combined challenges arising from security and socio-economic issues.\n\n22. As it is said, the past is but a story told, the future will still be written in gold. Let us be united in our fight to keep our Nation united against all odds and with gratitude, celebrate life in this new epoch.\n\n23. I wish you a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari",

          "text": "Timi Edwin was only 10 years old when her peers started to taunt her for having a big stomach and no breasts. They called her all sorts of names, which made her sad. \u201cI felt bad, insignificant,\u201d Timi told channelstv.com. \u201cI felt like I shouldn\u2019t have been born. And it affected my psychology because I developed low-self esteem, which affected my studies.\u201d\n\nIn university, she was advised to pull out of school because she was always falling ill.\n\nWhen she started dating, most of her partners acted like they were doing her a favour. One engagement fell through after two years.\n\nAt some point, Timi wished for death.\n\nBut relying on support from her mother and God, she resolved that sickle cell disease would not define her.\n\nToday, Timi has degrees from Covenant University and Business School Netherlands. She also has more than a decade of experience working in the corporate world and is the founder and CEO of CrimsonBow Sickle Cell Initiative, a nonprofit that aims to enlighten more Nigerians about sickle cell disease and provide emotional and medical support to patients.\n\nWith support from the Ford Foundation and other donors, CrimsonBow, since 2017, has organised community outreaches in rural communities where people are sensitised and tested for the disease. CrimsonBow also holds a monthly clinic where drugs and emotional support are provided to patients. Thousands have benefited. \u201cI am extremely fulfilled,\u201d Timi said.\n\nSickle cell disease, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), is a major genetic disease where the normal round shape of red blood cells become like crescent moons, leading to blood clots which can cause extreme pain in the back, chest, hands and feet.\n\nA stem cell transplant, a procedure that requires a donor, is expensive, emotionally exhausting and carries fatal risks, is the only known cure.\n\nThe disease is prevalent in Nigeria, perhaps more than anywhere in the world.\n\nAbout 30 per cent of the Nigerian population are carriers of the sickle cell trait. And almost three per cent of Nigerians are living with the disease.\n\nIt is considered to be the most common genetic disorder in the country, but testing is not available to the vast majority of infants, leading to thousands of deaths every year.\n\nEarly detection is key because most sickle cell patients die during the first five years of life.\n\nApproximately 50% of deaths occur during the second six months of life, according to one study.\n\nLekmark Tyoden was one of those who made it through to adulthood.\n\n\u201cIt has been a journey that is tough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is associated with painful episodes. I lived with it through childhood. And a lot of my activities were disrupted, including schooling.\n\n\u201cI used to love playing football, but I have to watch my limits. If it becomes too strenuous, it can be a source of trigger.\u201d\n\nAs a child, he too was stereotyped.\n\n\u201cPeople called me a weakling, a sickler,\u201d Lekmark, who is now a clinical psychologist in Jos city, said.\n\n\u201cSome say because you are living with sickle cell, you cannot live above a certain age. And it is expected that you will die soon. Those kinds of statements can affect people psychologically. You have people who go into depression because of these forms of stigma. They isolate themselves, they have self-doubt.\n\n\u201cBut we are capable of making contributions to humanity. We are capable of living.\u201d\n\nControversial moves\n\nIn September, the Nigerian Senate passed a bill seeking to improve the prevention and management of sickle cell disease. It was a pivotal moment.\n\nChairman of the Senate committee on health, Yahaya Oloriegbe, said the bill \u201cwill strengthen existing structures\u201d to eliminate the disease.\n\nAccording to a copy of the bill obtained by channelstv.com, it will empower the Ministry of Health to accredit reputable public and private hospitals which will offer free genotype testing, counselling and treatment.\n\nThe bill, which was originally sponsored by Senator Sam Egwu of Ebonyi, also contains clauses that actively seek to dissuade carriers of the sickle cell gene from getting married and birthing children. This stems from an unproved belief that ensuring two carriers of the sickle cell gene do not produce children may, in a generation or two, wipe out the disease.\n\nBut these clauses have been criticised by Annette Akinsete, a public health physician and National Director at the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simplistic,\u201d she said in an interview with channelstv.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as it appears in real life. We have to base whatever we do on science. What is the scientific evidence?\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, there is scientific evidence that when you compel or force people who are interested in marrying each other from not doing so because of sickle cell disease, it leads to a lot of dislocation of relationships. They go on and marry other people, but they don\u2019t bring their complete selves into their current relationship.\n\n\u201cAlso, it\u2019s a human rights issue. You have no right to compel other people to go along with your belief.\u201d\n\nIn 1995, the Military Administrator of Oyo State proposed a punitive edict aimed at prohibiting marriages between carriers of the sickle gene, but it was later deemed to be unconstitutional and a contravention of the human rights charter, to which Nigeria is a signatory.\n\n\u201cThe reality . . . is that enforced selective mating of couples has never been shown anywhere in the world to have reduced the incidence of any inherited disorder,\u201d said a paper by Professor Olu Akinyanju, a Hematologist and Founder of the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria. It was attempted by the Church in Cyprus for the control of thalassaemia but led to \u201cincreased anxiety and stigmatisation of affected persons and healthy carriers of the gene.\n\n\u201cThis, in turn, led to widespread denial and falsification of haemoglobin genotype results among carriers who wanted to marry each other.\n\n\u201cWhat the Church in Cyprus now does is to ensure that all couples have been counselled on thalassaemia before marriage.\u201d\n\nAkinsete has proposed a similar revision for the Nigerian sickle cell bill.\n\n\u201cWhat you need is excellent counselling practices,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that goes hand-in-hand with testing. So when you test early, we are targeting young people in elementary, primary, secondary and university; long before they get into relationships, they already know what their genotype is. So it\u2019s not when they are ready to walk on the aisle, you begin to do tests. That\u2019s pretty late. At that point, they are already invested in each other. We are asking for a bill that speaks to early diagnosis.\n\n\u201cCouples who come forward for counselling, even those who are near marriage, 80 per cent of those that are properly counselled will not go along. It\u2019s the 20 per cent that will decide to proceed. So, those 20 per cent, you should give them the available options. There is what you call prenatal diagnosis, so they can determine the genotype of the foetus. And sickle cell is getting better and better treated globally; we were just talking about clinical trials for new drugs.\n\n\u201cThen there is what we call preimplantation genetic diagnosis. It\u2019s done through IVF. That is also fraught with a lot of ethical, sometimes religious considerations. I\u2019m Catholic and in catholicism that amounts to murder. But these are still options that are available. There is also adoption.\u201d\n\nLiving with the pain\n\nBunmi Eunice, 31, wasn\u2019t diagnosed with sickle cell disease until she was seven years old, after suffering from waist pain for over two years.\n\n\u201cI would scream; it was so uncomfortable,\u201d she said of the waist pain. Then she was admitted to the hospital and tests revealed her red blood cells were sickle-shaped.\n\n\u201cI used to miss school for weeks; and when I resume everybody would be like \u2018sorry\u2019; and nobody must flog you and you weren\u2019t allowed to do anything strenuous,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt different from everybody else. I felt like I couldn\u2019t do what others could do. But I also knew it was for my own good.\u201d\n\nOver the years, she has learnt to live with the disease.\n\n\u201cI have grown to a place where I can take care of myself,\u201d Bunmi, now a graduate of the University of Benin, told channelstv.com. \u201cMy crises have reduced. I don\u2019t have any other underlying issues apart from sickle cell disease. And I take care of myself and observe my medication \u2013 Folic Acid, B-Complex, Vitamin C and multivitamins. I drink a lot of water and eat well, including a lot of fruits.\n\n\u201cRecently, I have been exercising and found out it was of help; but nothing so strenuous; something I know my body can cope with. I also take painkillers. I go for blood tests to check the level of my PCV (Packed Cell Volume) once I don\u2019t feel good, especially when I\u2019m done with my period.\u201d\n\nBut a lot of sickle cell patients are not so lucky due to a multitude of factors, including genetics, quality of healthcare and emotional support. The behaviour of sickle cells can lead to stroke, chest pain and difficulty in breathing, hypertension, damage to organs such as the kidneys, liver and spleen. Others include blindness and leg ulcers. In men, sickle cells can lead to painful, long-lasting erections which can lead to impotence over time. And pregnant women with sickle blood cells are more likely to experience miscarriage or premature birth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d says Eunice. \u201cWhen I am down medically, I get necessary treatment as fast as I can; and psychologically, I just try to be happy. All over your body, you are feeling pain; you can\u2019t even get up, you can\u2019t even breathe properly. Someone who doesn\u2019t have it does not really understand. The degree of pain is like a hundred raised to the power of 10.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not the end of the world. You just have to keep going. Because when you start feeling depressed, you start degrading your self-worth. And it can lead to suicide. People in the world have other challenges; there is cancer, Covid, HIV/AIDS. Sickle cell disease is not the worst.\u201d\n\nA permanent cure?\n\nEbenezer Mathew, 20, thought he would always live with excruciating pain and countless trips to the hospital. But in 2013 he received a stem cell transplant in Benin-City and his genotype changed from SS to AA.\n\n\u201cThe difference is much,\u201d Mathew, who is now studying to be an anesthesiologist, told channelstv.com. \u201cI don\u2019t fall sick again. I don\u2019t think I have been admitted to a hospital since then. The surgery changed my life.\u201d\n\nStem cell transplant is the proven way to permanently cure sickle cell disease, but it is out of reach for millions of Nigerians affected due to its cost implications, according to the surgeon who operated on Mathew, Professor Nosakhare Bazuaye.\n\n\u201cAn average transplant will cost close to about $20,000 (N10 million),\u201d Professor Bazuaye said in an interview. \u201cTransplants in low-resource countries like India will cost about $25,000. But in Europe, it will cost about $250,000, and that\u2019s millions of naira.\n\n\u201cBut we can do it in Nigeria for between 10 to 15 million naira. Everything we use is in dollars; all the drugs are imported in dollars. Power is also a big problem. To run the centre, the patient is on admission for two to three months, we need to power the clinic for those months. And in a month, you spend over a million on power \u2013 diesel is very expensive. On average, for just power alone, you are spending over four million. Whereas in developed countries, power is usually available.\n\n\u201cAnd then you buy drugs again, and another four million is gone. And bed fees and other ancillary things like blood. So just the cost gulps more than N10 million. This is something we had hoped the government would come in fully, just like they do in India, and make it medical tourism. I get patients from Ghana and other West African countries. But it\u2019s on a small scale. We only have four isolation rooms, whereas where I was training in Switzerland, we had over 30 isolation rooms. And we could do an average of 30 to 40 transplants in a month. In Benin-city, we can only do an average of two to three transplants in a month. How many Nigerians can also afford it?\u201d\n\nProfessor Bazuaye is on record as the first doctor to perform a successful stem cell transplant in Nigeria, in 2011, at the University of Benin\u2019s Teaching Hospital (UBTH). The patient was a five-year-old, Ndik Mathew. His blood was drained and replaced with that of his brother, which has no trace of sickle cell anaemia. To deliver a successful operation, UBTH ensured there was 24-hour electricity supply. He was also kept in an air-tight room in the Stem Cell Centre for months. The centre was powered by two industrial generators gulping up 60 to 100 litres of fuel per hour.\n\nOver a decade after that operation, not much has changed in terms of power infrastructure or significant government intervention. After just three successful surgeries at UBTH, Professor Bazuaye and his team partnered with Celltek healthcare, a private facility in Benin City. At least 17 stem cell transplants have been carried out under that partnership.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m Chief Medical Director in Igbinedion University Teaching Hospital,\u201d Professor Bazuaye said. \u201cWe are trying to use a CBN facility to build an international transplant centre. We want to be able to do as many transplants and make it medical tourism.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping, for example, that the wife of the governors can take it as part of their responsibility. If every wife of a governor sponsors one transplant a year, they would have sponsored 37 times four. That would go a long way. Most Nigerians cannot afford the transplant. But we are hoping that NGOs, the government, wives of governors can come in and make this thing as easy as possible.\u201d\n\nThe case for early testing\n\nZainab Bagudu, now a doctor abroad, lost two aunts to sickle cell disease while living in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMy grandparents had eight to nine kids. I know two passed away from sickle cell before I was even born. And the other two, in their adulthood.\u201d\n\nShe remembers the deaths as painful and now believes they may have survived for much longer if her grandparents had better access to information about the disease.\n\n\u201cIt boils down to education,\u201d Dr Bagudu said. \u201cEven the politicians need to be educated.\u201d\n\nA huge proportion of sickle cell disease deaths in Nigeria occur in children under five. According to a recent study in the respected medical journal The Lancet, the disease contributed about six per cent of total deaths among under-five Nigerian children between 2003 and 2013. During this time period, the disease killed approximately 35,000 children every year. Most parents do not even know their children have the disease until tragedy strikes and explanations like witchcraft and bad luck are proffered.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2012, the Federal Ministry of Health initiated a plan to establish six special Millenium Development Goal (MDG) sickle cell centres across each geopolitical zone (Kebbi, Gombe, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Lagos and Bayelsa). Each centre was equipped with a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) machine, used for diagnosing the disease. But by 2017, the number of newborn babies screened was fewer than 2,000 across the six centres, according to one study due to low budgetary allocation, inadequately trained personnel, expired reagents, limited availability of consumables, absence of mechanisms to collect samples from babies regularly and, of course, erratic power supply.\n\nIn 2020, the Consortium on Newborn Screening in Africa (CONSA), an initiative funded by the American Society of Haematology (ASH), was launched to screen 10,000 \u2013 16,000 babies per year over the next five years in seven African countries, including Nigeria. Professor Obiageli Nnodu, a haematologist with 36 years of field experience, is coordinating the CONSA programme in Nigeria.\n\nWhile the pilot CONSA programme will only cover a tiny fraction of all babies born in Nigeria, it aims to establish the value of newborn screening to the government.\n\nRather than invest in expensive equipment without adequate support facilities like in the past, Professor Nnodu has co-published a paper showing how a $2 test can be incorporated into existing immunisation programmes in primary healthcare settings. In an interview with channelstv.com, she said the Federal Government was in the process of formulating a policy that inculcates the $2 test, but it remains unclear how successful the nationwide execution will be.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is more education,\u201d Professor Nnodu\n\nsaid. \u201cSickle cell disease can be easily treated if newborn babies are tested early and are placed on medication.\u201d She gave an example of two babies who tested positive for sickle cell disease at the beginning of the CONSA programme last year. While one set of parents refused to believe their baby had sickle cell since they looked healthy, the second set of parents quickly began the necessary line of treatment. The untreated baby died weeks later while the other baby has already celebrated a first-year birthday.\n\nKeeping hope alive\n\n\u201cWhen people know their genotype, it will go a long way in reducing sickle cell cases in Nigeria,\u201d Timi Edwin, whose organisation Crimsonbow had organised numerous community outreaches, told channelstv.com.\n\nShe hopes the government makes testing mandatory for all newborns and ramps up sensitisation about sickle cell disease across the country.\n\n\u201cGovernment has the machinery to create impact on a larger scale,\u201d Lekmark, the clinical psychologist in Jos, said.\n\nBut, like Timi, Lekmark is not just waiting for the government. In Jos, he is part of a group that provides emotional support and medication to sickle cell disease patients and those who want to learn more about the condition.\n\n\u201cGod has been gracious to me,\u201d Lekmark said, about what keeps him going besides the support of family and friends.\n\n\u201cI have seen him come through for me. Developing that relationship with my creator also gives me a sense of purpose, that I have to keep living. He was the one that created me, he has a plan for me. I believe that so much. I know that I am not a coincidence. I carry that positivity in my mind.\u201d",
          "summary": "Early detection is key because most sickle cell patients die during the first five years of life.\nWe are capable of living.\u201dControversial movesIn September, the Nigerian Senate passed a bill seeking to improve the prevention and management of sickle cell disease.\nAnd sickle cell is getting better and better treated globally; we were just talking about clinical trials for new drugs.\n\u201cSickle cell disease can be easily treated if newborn babies are tested early and are placed on medication.\u201d She gave an example of two babies who tested positive for sickle cell disease at the beginning of the CONSA programme last year.\nShe hopes the government makes testing mandatory for all newborns and ramps up sensitisation about sickle cell disease across the country.",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria has called on Nigerians to pray for God\u2019s mercy in 2022.\n\nIn a New Year message signed on Friday by CAN President Samson Ayokunle, the group said Nigerians irrespective of their religious affiliations should \u201ccry for the mercy of God\u201d that can preserve the nation and bring an end to all insecurity.\n\n\u201cI call on all Nigerians, irrespective of their religious affiliations, to rise up and cry for the mercy of God that can preserve us and bring an end to all these pains. It appears as if our governments have got to their wit end over the menace of insecurity. Their major focus now is on the 2023 general election. Can the 2023 election happen if the nation is overrun by criminals? Our nation must survive first and be at peace before an election can take place.\n\n\u201cExcept for the mercy of God to intervene divinely and miraculously, we would be like Sodom and Gomorrah. It is only God who can make the 2023 general election a reality. It is only God in his own way who can teach our leaders the right step to take. It is only God who can send us help from above. Because of the desperate situation, we are in, some governors are already calling for self-defence and declaration of the state of emergency! This is unprecedented,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nREAD ALSO: 2022 Budget: Why Buhari Is Unhappy With Changes By NASS\n\nLooking back to the activities of 2021, Ayokunle said, \u201cGlory be to our God who helps us to escape all dangers and threats of the Year 2021 occasioned by the criminal activities of the bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and other unscrupulous elements amidst us.\u201d\n\n\u201c2021 was one year too many as a result of the ways and manners these criminals have been operating with impunity as if this is not the country, we have been all these years. It is as if they have taken over the country. They invade communities, markets, churches, and schools. They kill, maim, destroy, and kidnap without much resistance or hindrance.\n\n\u201cThey have turned our roads into death traps where they now kidnap for money, apparently due to the poor conditions of our roads and suddenly kidnapping has become a big business as the innocent people are being kidnapped and ransom in millions are being demanded and paid.\n\n\u201cFamilies of kidnapped people are at the mercy of the criminals! Some were not even fortunate as they were killed after the ransom has been paid! Our security agencies have been overstretched and the best done by our government is far from being enough if we must say the truth without deceiving ourselves. The Police have been parading the arrested kidnappers on the television but surprisingly, it appears as if they are too busy with their investigations to prosecute them!,\u201d the CAN President lamented.\n\nHe stressed further that the call for help from the developed world and the United Nations over rising insecurity got little attention as \u201cthey seem to be more occupied and busier with COVID-19 than pay attention to the daily destruction of lives going on in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe called on denominational and church leaders to use the opportunity of the New Year Fasting and Prayers programme of churches to rescue Nigeria from those who are hell-bent on destroying it by deliberately praying for the mercy of God over our unfortunate situation.\n\n\u201cFor the Lord, our God is a merciful God. He will not leave us or allow these heartless criminals to destroy us. We serve a God who is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.\n\n\u201cIt was in His mercy that He rescued the family of Noah against the Great Flood; He delivered Lot and his family in Sodom and Gomorrah shortly before the destruction of those cities. By his mercy, he delivered Israel from Egyptian captivity without Israel fighting any battle. The list of God\u2019s merciful intervention in human affairs is endless. That same God will surely have mercy on our country in Jesus\u2019 name,\u201d he said.\n\nHe prayed that 2022 be the year of total deliverance from all manners of insecurity challenges in the country.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill of N17.126 trillion into law.\n\nThe President signed the budget presented to him by his Senior Special Assistant (Senate) on National Assembly, Senator Babajide Omoworare, on Friday at the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nHe was, however, displeased with some changes as well as major additions and reductions made by the National Assembly in critical projects \u2018without justification\u2019.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari\u2019s Remarks After Signing 2022 Budget Into Law [Full Text]\n\nPresident Buhari highlighted some of the worrisome changes in the budget to include an increase in projected Federal Government independent revenue by N400 billion, reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion, and reduction of the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively; all without any explanation.\n\nHe also expressed his reservations on the inclusion of new provisions totalling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote, which he said negated the principles of separation of powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\n\nThe President was also concerned about the changes to the original Executive proposal in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects, as well as reduction of the provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects and the introduction of 6,576 new projects into the budget.\n\nAccording to him, most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of state and local governments and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed, and cost.\n\nPresident Buhari said he would revert to the National Assembly with a request for an amendment as soon as the lawmakers return from their recess, to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to his administration do not suffer a setback as a result of reduced funding.\n\nHe recounted that during the presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, he stated that the 2022 fiscal year would be very crucial in his administration\u2019s efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects, as well as improve the general living conditions of Nigerians.\n\nThe President insisted that the cuts by the lawmakers could render the implementation of the budget impossible.\n\nHe promised to commence early preparation of the 2023 transition budget and quickly begin the process to ensure early submission of the 2023-2025 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper as well as the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; and Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, among others, witnessed the signing of the budget.\n\nIn his response, the Senate President told State House correspondents that the lawmakers were right in their decisions.\n\nThe reservations of the Executive, according to him, are not unusual and may not necessarily coincide with that of the legislature.\n\nThis comes a week after lawmakers in the House of Representatives and Senate chambers of the National Assembly passed a budget of N17.126 trillion, increasing the benchmark price of crude from $57 to $62 per barrel.\n\nDuring the plenary on Wednesday last week, the Senate had passed the 2022 budget while Senate President Lawan gave an assurance that the bill would be sent to the President for assent the following day.\n\nLawmakers in the House of Representatives had also passed the budget last Tuesday. The National Assembly raised the total 2022 budget figure from the proposed N16.391 trillion to N17.126 trillion.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, had disclosed to Channels Television on Tuesday that the budget would be signed on Friday.\n\nChannels Television had also obtained a communication addressed to the Presidency by the Clerk to the National Assembly, Mr Ojo Amos, indicating that the bill had been transmitted by the National Assembly.\n\nThe document, with Reference Number NASS/CNA/37/Vol.1/35, suggested that the budget was transmitted last Friday and received by the Office of the Chief of Staff to the President on Saturday.",

          "title": "Buhari Signs Nigeria\u2019s 2022 Budget, to Seek Amendment Due to \u2018Worrisome Changes\u2019 By Parliament",
          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari Friday in Abuja signed into law the 2022 Appropriation Bill and the 2021 Finance Bill.\n\nThe President signed the documents in the Presidential Villa in the presence of Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and other members of the Federal Executive Council.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the President said the 2022 Budget provides for aggregate expenditures of N17.127 trillion, an increase of N735.85 billion over the initial Executive Proposal for a total expenditure of N16.391 trillion.\n\nThe President explained that N186.53 billion of the increase however came from additional critical expenditures that he had authorised the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to forward to the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Minister will provide the public with the details of the budget as passed by the National Assembly, and signed into law by me,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President announced that as the 2023 Budget is going to be a transition budget, work will start in earnest to ensure early submission of the 2023-2025 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper as well as the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n\nHe, therefore, directed Heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, more specifically with the Budget Office of the Federation, to realise this very important objective.\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed strong reservations on the \u2018\u2018worrisome changes\u2019\u2019 made by the National Assembly to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal.\n\nHe announced that he would revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment as soon as the Assembly resumes to ensure that critical ongoing projects cardinal to this administration do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\nThe President recounted that during the presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, he had stated that the fiscal year 2022 would be very crucial in his administration\u2019s efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects, as well as improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is in this regard that I must express my reservations about many of the changes that the National Assembly has made to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal.\n\n\u2018\u2018Some of the worrisome changes are as follows:\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in projected FGN Independent Revenue by N400 billion, the justification for which is yet to be provided to the Executive;\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Maturing Bonds by N22 billion without any explanation;\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction of the provisions for the Non-Regular Allowances of the Nigerian Police Force and the Nigerian Navy by N15 billion and N5 billion respectively.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is particularly worrisome because personnel cost provisions are based on agencies\u2019 nominal roll and approved salaries/allowances;\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, an increase of N21.72 billion in the Overhead budgets of some MDAs, while the sum of N1.96 billion was cut from the provision for some MDAs without apparent justification;\n\n\u2018\u2018Increase in the provision for Capital spending (excluding Capital share in Statutory Transfer) by a net amount of N575.63 billion, from N4.89 trillion to N5.47 trillion.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed concern in the reductions in provisions for some critical projects, including N12.6 billion in the Ministry of Transport\u2019s budget for the ongoing Rail Modernisation projects; N25.8 billion from Power Sector Reform Programme under the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning; N14.5 billion from several projects of the Ministry of Agriculture, and introducing over 1,500 new projects into the budgets of this Ministry and its agencies.\n\nFurther, the President also expressed his reservations on the following:\n\n\u2018\u2018Inclusion of new provisions totaling N36.59 billion for National Assembly\u2019s projects in the Service Wide Vote which negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislative arm of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018The changes to the original Executive proposal are in the form of new insertions, outright removals, reductions and/or increases in the amounts allocated to projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Provisions made for as many as 10,733 projects were reduced while 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Reduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment\u2019 projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018The cuts in the provisions for several of these projects by the National Assembly may render the projects unimplementable or set back their completion, especially some of this Administration\u2019s strategic capital projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Most of the projects inserted relate to matters that are basically the responsibilities of State and Local Governments, and do not appear to have been properly conceptualised, designed and costed.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many more projects have been added to the budgets of some MDAs with no consideration for the institutional capacity to execute the additional projects and/or for the incremental recurrent expenditure that may be required.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari declared that it was surprising that despite the National Assembly increasing projected revenue by N609.27 billion, the additional Executive request of N186.53 billion for critical expenditure items could not be accommodated without increasing the deficit, while the sum of N550.59 billion from the projected incremental revenues was allocated at the discretion of National Assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018I signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to enable its implementation to commence on 1st January 2022.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, I will revert to the National Assembly with a request for amendment and/or virement as soon as the Assembly resumes to ensure that critical ongoing projects that are cardinal to this administration, and those nearing completion, do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn COVID-19 and budget implementation, the President said despite the lingering adverse effects of the pandemic, he was happy with the success recorded in the implementation of the 2021 Budget.\n\n\u2018\u2018The sum of N3.94 trillion that was provided for the implementation of capital projects by MDAs during the fiscal year has been released fully.\n\n\u2018\u2018To enable MDAs to complete the implementation of their 2021 capital projects and optimise the impact of the capital budget on the economy, they have been allowed to continue to expend the funds released for their 2021 capital budgets till 31st March, 2022,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President commended the understanding and speedy action of the National Assembly on this matter.\n\n\u2018\u2018As the 2022 Budget will be the last full year budget to be implemented by our Administration, its effective implementation is very critical for delivering our legacy projects, promoting social inclusion and strengthening the resilience of the economy.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning will implement all measures required to ensure timely and targeted release of capital votes.\n\n\u2018\u2018All MDAs are to effect early commencement of project implementation, while ensuring productive use of funds provided for achievement of the objectives set for their sectors.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the incidence of new COVID-19 variants globally, we will ensure timely implementation of measures provided for in the 2022 Budget to contain the spread of the virus and protect our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018We continue to count on the collaboration of the State governments in our effort to protect the lives and livelihood of our people.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo achieve the laudable objectives of the 2022 Budget, President Buhari pledged that the Federal Government would further intensify revenue mobilisation efforts.\n\nHe expressed optimism in the ability of the Government to finance the budget considering the positive global oil market outlook and the continuing improvement in non-oil revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2018To achieve our revenue targets, revenue generating agencies, and indeed all MDAs must ensure prompt and full remittance of collected revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2018Relevant Agencies must also ensure the realisation of our crude oil production and export targets.\n\n\u2018\u2018I also appeal to our fellow citizens and the business community at large to fulfil their tax obligations promptly.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, being a deficit budget, the specific Borrowing Plan will be forwarded to the National Assembly shortly.\n\n\u2018\u2018I count on the cooperation of the National Assembly for a quick consideration and approval of the Plan when submitted.\n\n\u2018\u2018All borrowings will be judiciously utilised and invested in our future growth and prosperity.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President also directed MDAs to liaise with the Bureau of Public Enterprises and/or the Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission to explore available opportunities for public-private partnerships, concessions as well as climate finance arrangements to fast-track the pace of infrastructural development.\n\nHe thanked the Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning, the Budget Office of the Federation, and all who worked tirelessly and sacrificed so much towards producing the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u2018\u2018Let me conclude by commending the understanding, sacrifice and resilience of our people during these challenging times.\n\n\u2018\u2018As a Government, we remain committed to improving the general living conditions of our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will continue to implement measures aimed at moderating the unintended negative effects of policies on the citizenry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Hundreds of homes have been destroyed and tens of thousands evacuated in Colorado, United States, after wildfires driven by high winds engulfed two towns near the state capital, Denver.\n\nAt least one first responder and six others were injured on Thursday, though Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle acknowledged there could be more casualties due to the intensity of fires that quickly swept across the region as winds gusted up to 169 kilometers per hour (105 milers per hour)\n\nAuthorities ordered evacuations for Louisville, which has about 21,000 residents, and Superior, home to 13,000 people and a suburb of Boulder.\n\nThe neighbouring towns are roughly 32km (20 miles) northwest of Denver, a city of more than 715,000 people.\n\nA towering plume of smoke from the wildfires was visible in Denver. Several buildings were seen burning in Superior.\n\nResidents evacuated fairly calmly and orderly, but the winding streets in the suburban subdivisions quickly became clogged as people tried to get out. It sometimes took cars as long as 45 minutes to advance just a few hundred metres.\n\nStructures burn as a wind-driven wildfire forced evacuation of the Superior suburb of Boulder, Colorado, on Thursday [Trevor Hughes/USA Today via Reuters]\n\nThe first fire erupted just before 10:30am and was \u201cattacked pretty quickly and laid down later in the day and is currently being monitored\u201d with no structures lost, Pelle said.\n\nA second wildfire, reported just after 11am, \u201cballooned and spread rapidly east\u201d, Pelle added. The blaze spans 6.5 square kilometres (2.5 square miles) and has engulfed parts of the area in smoky, orangish skies and sent residents scrambling to get to safety.\n\nThe activity of the fires, which are burning unusually late into the winter season, will depend on how the winds behave overnight and could determine when crews are able to go in and begin assessing the damage and searching for any victims.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of fire we can\u2019t fight head on,\u201d Pelle said. \u201cWe actually had deputy sheriffs and firefighters in areas that had to pull out because they just got overrun,\u201d he added.\n\nNews reports said at least 580 homes, a hotel and a shopping centre have burned.

          "text": "Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye was released from prison on Friday nearly five years after being convicted of corruption, fuelling debate over whether she would play any role ahead of a March presidential election.\n\nPark, 69, was the country\u2019s first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliamentary vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also led to the imprisonment of the chiefs of two conglomerates, Samsung and Lotte.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s top court in January upheld a 20-year prison sentence imposed after Park was found guilty of colluding with a friend, who is also in jail, to receive tens of billions of won from the companies, mostly to fund her friend\u2019s family and non-profit foundations.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in granted a special pardon to Park last week, citing her deteriorating health and expressing hope to \u201covercome unfortunate past history and promote national unity\u201d.\n\nBroadcasters showed Park leaving a Seoul hospital, where she had stayed since last month for medical treatment, after correction officials delivered a letter of pardon at midnight.\n\nShe did not comment but her lawyer has said Park, the daughter of a former military ruler, had offered an apology for causing public concern and thanked Moon for making a \u201ctough decision\u201d.\n\nPark\u2019s release comes as her old party, the main opposition conservative People Power Party, and Moon\u2019s Democratic Party are in a tight presidential race.\n\nHer imprisonment divided the country, with right-wing, pro-Park groups staging weekly rallies to denounce Moon and his policies and call for Park\u2019s release, until COVID-19 distancing rules stifled the rallies last year.\n\nHundreds of Park\u2019s supporters braved freezing temperatures to flock to the hospital where she was staying late on Thursday to celebrate her release, with more than 1,000 bouquets of flowers arriving.\n\nAbout 200 people held a protest in downtown Seoul against her release, the Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nIt was not clear if Park would resume any political activity but she said in a memoir released on Thursday that her conviction was politically motivated and she expressed hopes to \u201cmeet the people again one day\u201d.\n\nPeople Power\u2019s presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, who investigated the Park scandal as prosecutor-general, said on Friday he had done his job as a public servant, adding he would like to visit Park when her health improved.",

          "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has told his United States counterpart Joe Biden that any sanctions over Ukraine would be a big mistake, an aide to the Kremlin said on Thursday, after the two leaders spoke by phone ahead of lower-level talks next month.\n\nThe call, which US officials said began at 3:35pm EST (20:35 GMT) and lasted 50 minutes, came amid weeks of Western concerns over Russia\u2019s deployment of tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine.\n\nKremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Russia was satisfied with the conversation, which he said centred on security guarantees that Moscow wants from the West, but that any substantial sanctions against Russia would be \u201ca colossal mistake\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe hope this will not happen,\u201d Ushakov told reporters after the phone call.\n\nIt was the second time Putin and Biden held direct talks this month, as the Russian military buildup near Ukraine continues to heighten fears that Russia may be preparing for an imminent invasion of its neighbour.\n\nIn a statement describing Thursday\u2019s talks, the White House said Biden urged Putin to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the simmering tensions and \u201cmade clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine\u201d.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied that it plans to make an incursion into Ukraine, instead accusing Western nations of undermining the security situation in the region through the expansion of NATO and Ukraine\u2019s growing ties with the alliance.\n\nAhead of the discussion, both sides insisted they were ready to listen. But with Thursday\u2019s talks setting the stage for lower-level, face-to-face negotiations in Geneva in January, there were few indications of significant concessions on the horizon.\n\nBiden expressed support for those upcoming discussions during his call with Putin, the White House also said, and \u201creiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation\u201d.\n\nSamuel Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King\u2019s College London, told Al Jazeera that both the US and Russia \u201cneed to be seen as putting the effort in\u201d amid the tensions.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Putin to claim some victory, to show that maybe the West is buckling a little bit \u2013 if he can spin it that way,\u201d Greene said. \u201cFor the Biden administration \u2026 and the European allies, it\u2019s extremely important to really do everything they can \u2013 short of making concessions that they can\u2019t make \u2013 to ensure peace and security in and around Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTalks next month\n\nEarlier this month, the Russian government published draft security pacts demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the deployment of troops and weapons in central and eastern Europe.\n\nBut the US and its NATO allies have said only members of the alliance can decide when other nations join, while stressing that any security talks with Moscow would need to take into account NATO\u2019s concerns and involve Ukraine and other partners.\n\nSergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, said this week that Russian diplomats and military officials would take part in talks with the US next month on the list of security guarantees Moscow wants from Washington.\n\nThose discussions in Geneva are set to take place on January 10, while Moscow and NATO representatives are expected to meet on January 12. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes Russia and the US, will address the tensions the following day.\n\nRussia\u2019s delegation will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, and the US delegation by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman.\n\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the US\u2019s \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Ukraine in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, the State Department said.\n\nThe United Kingdom warned Russia last week that any incursion into Ukraine \u201cwould be a massive strategic mistake and would be met with strength, including coordinated sanctions with our allies to impose a severe cost on Russia\u2019s interests and economy\u201d.\n\nPutin has said Russia is not looking for war with its neighbour but wanted an \u201cimmediate\u201d response from the US and its allies to its demand for security guarantees.\n\nRussia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and shortly after supported a separatist rebellion in the country\u2019s east, plunging relations between Moscow and the West to post-Cold War lows.\n\nThe fighting in Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland, known as the Donbas, has killed more than 14,000 people to date, according to Kyiv.",

          "text": "Sudanese security forces have shot four people dead during nationwide protests, a doctors\u2019 group said, as tens of thousands of people marched against military rule.\n\nSecurity forces fired tear gas and stun grenades as protesters marched through Khartoum and the neighbouring cities of Omdurman and Bahri towards the presidential palace on Thursday.\n\nThe Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) said four protesters were shot dead by security forces, three of them in Omdurman.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, police authorities confirmed the death toll and said 297 protesters and 49 police officers had been injured.\n\nThe protests were the 11th day of major demonstrations since an October 25 coup, which saw Abdallah Hamdok removed and then reinstated as prime minister. The demonstrators have been demanding that the military play no role in government during a transition to free elections.\n\nReporting from Khartoum, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mohamed Vall said the situation in Omdurman had developed into a serious confrontation between the security forces and anti-coup protesters.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the day, the impression was that the protest was less violent and in smaller numbers than previous demonstrations.\n\n\u201cBut as the day progressed, it became clear that because the security forces prevented the protesters in Omdurman from crossing the bridges and reaching central Khartoum, the main confrontations took place there,\u201d said Vall.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Security forces confronted protesters about 2km (1.2 miles) from the palace in the centre of the capital, Reuters news agency reported, adding that there was a heavy security presence in the area.\n\nAmid a communications blackout, most bridges to Khartoum were closed, with at least two blocked by shipping containers. An army checkpoint with an armoured vehicle was seen at one of the bridges that remained open.\n\nProtesters heading towards the blocked bridge connecting the city of Bahri to the capital chanted: \u201cAs much as we sacrifice and die, we won\u2019t be ruled by the boot.\u201d\n\nProtesters continued facing tear gas in Bahri past sundown near the blocked bridge, a witness told Reuters.\n\nBridges were blocked off during the last protests on December 25, when tens of thousands took to the streets.\n\nProtesters opposed to military rule reached near the presidential palace that day, despite the extensive use of tear gas and a communications blackout. CCSD said more than 200 people were injured during that protest, with six caused by live bullets.\n\nAt least 52 people have been killed by security forces since pro-democracy activists launched a campaign of street demonstrations against the coup, according to the group.\n\nA source from a telecom company told Reuters the order to shut down the internet came from the Sudan National Telecommunications Corporation.\n\nActivists use the internet for organising demonstrations and broadcasting live footage of the rallies.\n\nMeanwhile, new surveillance cameras were installed on the Khartoum thoroughfares along which demonstrators were due to march on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking from Miami, Cameron Hudson, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Africa Center, said since the October 25 coup there have been \u201crepeated miscalculations by the military both in terms of the power and perseverance of the protest movement\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been more and more draconian efforts [by the military], essentially undermining whatever is left of the [political] transition at every stage,\u201d he added.\n\nBefore Thursday\u2019s protests, the US embassy appealed for restraint from the government led by military chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, which had been counting on a controversial November partnership deal with Hamdok to calm public anger.\n\n\u201cThe US embassy reiterates its support for peaceful expression of democratic aspiration, and the need to respect and protect individuals exercising free speech,\u201d a statement said.\n\n\u201cWe call for extreme discretion in use of force and urge authorities to refrain from employing arbitrary detention.\u201d\n\nActivists have condemned the sexual attacks during the December 19 protests, in which the United Nations said at least 13 women and girls were raped or gang-raped.\n\nHamdok had been held under effective house arrest for weeks before returning to the prime ministerial post under the November deal, which promised elections in July 2023.\n\nBut the agreement was widely criticised as a gift to the military that gave a cloak of legitimacy to its coup, with pro-democracy protesters accusing Hamdok of \u201cbetrayal\u201d.\n\nSudan\u2019s sovereign council this week reinstated powers of arrests, detentions and seizures to the country\u2019s intelligence service.",
