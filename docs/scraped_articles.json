          "title": "Reps debate bill to end widow, husband brothers\u2019 forced marriage",
          "text": "The House of Representatives has listed a series of cultural traditions it will outlaw, especially those infringing on the fundamental rights of widows in Nigeria.\n\nThey include preventing in-laws from taking over possession of property belonging to the late husband and forced marriage between a widow and her deceased husband\u2019s brothers.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported on December 12, 2021 that the House was about to abolish certain traditions and mourning rites that dehumanise widows.\n\nThe Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which is awaiting second reading at the House, specifically lists and defines the cultural practices, some of which are considered as mourning rites that must be performed by a widow.\n\nThe bill seeks to amend the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act No. 19, 2015, to \u201cprohibit the discrimination against widows and all forms of repressive and degrading widowhood practices, provide for remedies for victims and penalise offenders.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker representing the Akoko South-East/Akoko South-West Federal Constituency in Ondo State at the House, Adejoro Adeogun, sponsored the bill.\n\nThe bill proposes amendment to Section 46 of the Act by inserting definitions.\n\nThe proposed insertion partly reads, \u201cConsent means free, full, mutual, voluntary and informed decision not extracted under pressure or vitiated by external factors such as constraint, and consent is absent when coercive methods are used such as pressure of various kinds, emotional blackmail, physical duress, violence, abduction, confinement and confiscation of official papers to deny a person the option of refusal.\n\n\u201cHarmful widowhood practices mean all traditional behaviour, attitude, or practices, which negatively affect the rights of a widow and include (a) compelling a widow to (i) express her sorrow of losing a husband by wearing black, white or any other colour of clothes, not taking her bath or having a change of clothes, or wailing and falling against her will, (ii) go into seclusion for any length of time, (iii) sleep in the same space with the body of her deceased husband, (iv) un-weave her hair, keep a low cut, shave or scrape her hairs, (v) sit or sleep on a bare floor or mat, (vi) cook or eat from broken plates, (vii) swear to an oath or drink the bath water of her deceased husband in order to prove her innocence of any allegation or as part of cultural practice, (viii) under any guise, whether levirate or sororate, enter any form of marriage without her consent, or (ix) undergo any other repressive and degrading widowhood practices;\n\n\u201c(b) Maltreatment of a widow; (c) property grabbing against a widow; (d) willing of the matrimonial home to another person when the late husband is survived by a widow who has not remarried;\n\n(e) Transfer of the legal guardianship of a child of a widow to another person unless it is proven that (i) she is of unsound mind and body, or (ii) vesting guardianship of the child with her would be detrimental to the interests and welfare of the child; or (f) disinheriting a widow from a property jointly owned by her late husband and in-laws.\u201d\n\nThe bill also defines discrimination against widow to include \u201cany distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of her being widowed,\u201d while levirate marriage means the marriage of a widow to the brother of her deceased husband.\n\nIt further read, \u201cMaltreatment of widows includes domestic violence, sexual assault, forced marriage, trafficking, property grabbing, conversion of property, forced evictions, repressive widowhood practices as well as discrimination against widows.\n\n\u201cProperty grabbing includes taking of property of a deceased person from his widow or children and such property may include the marital home, land, or any other moveable or non-moveable property.\n\n\u201cSororate marriage means a husband engaging in marriage or sexual relations with the sister of his wife, usually after the death of his wife or if his wife is proven to be barren.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a widow residing with her in-laws or parents according to custom, tradition or due to other circumstances \u201cshall not be denied access to the facilities under this bill on that ground.\u201d\n\nThe bill also proposes a \u201cNational Day for the Prohibition of Discrimination against Widows, Women and Girls\u2019 to be marked every May 23.\u201d\n\nThe National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons will also be responsible for the enforcement of the proposed law, according to the bill.\n\nNAPTIP is to, among other things, \u201cmaintain a register of widows with such particulars and in such manner as may be prescribed by rules or regulations; collate and verify the antecedents of every widow covered under this bill to assess her need for assistance in such manner as may be prescribed by rules or regulations; provide for the abandoned or destitute widows, on an application prescribed for the purpose.\u201d\n\nUpon the application, the agency is to provide subsistence financial allowances per month, where the widow is infirm, destitute or has dependent child or children; or other monthly allowances where she has no dependent child or children.\n\nOthers are residential accommodation free of cost, where necessary; free education, including technical education to the dependent children of the widow; gainful employment; vocational training, where required; and such other facilities as may be prescribed by rules or regulations.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He said undeveloped plots had remained an eyesore in Abuja, despite the huge amount of money spent to provide basic infrastructure in the districts.\n\n\u201cHussaini recalled that the owners of these undeveloped plots scattered around the Abuja metropolis had been warned several times in the past, yet some remained recalcitrant.\u201d\n\nThe director also said although there were thousands of uncollected Certificates of Occupancy in the vaults, he noted that the department had given 495 Cs of O to bonafide owners from January to December 2021.\n\nHe, however, implored other allottees to come over and pick their certificates as such an act would help lubricate economic activities of the territory.\n\nOn the issuance of Rights of Occupancy within the year under review, Hussaini explained that the Land Administration Department released a total of 1,319 titles to the beneficiaries.\n\nHussaini said the department had witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of fresh applications for land in the FCT during the year under review, noting that 8,010 applied for land between January and December this year.\n\nThe director stated that the department released a total of 546 Certified True Copies to allottees in the year under review.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

And on the issue of passport, yes there are requests for people who need to renew their passports or get fresh passports.\n\n\u201cBut the mission has captured thousands of Nigerians who are having issues with passport in the past months and that is a great deal.\n\n\u201cThere was an intervention about three months ago, especially in my own city, Modena, we were able to capture about 250 people, we went to another city called Pesaro and we were able to capture 138 people.\n\n\u201cWe went to another city which I supervised and they were able to capture over 170 people. So, if you sum all these figures up you will get about a thousand.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, there are other cities that need to be covered and that is not to say that they are up to a million. I stand to debunk that any day, any time.\n\n\u201cNUNAI as it were is the umbrella body of all Associations in Italy which NIDO should be part of, and NUNAI has been working with Embassies long before the existence of NIDO in Italy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to speak more in favour or in criticism of NIDO because I do not know their modus of operandi and how they got their information.\n\n\u201cNUNAI has been in the forefront of issues that concerns Nigerians in Italy, in terms of welfare, in term of documentation, we have been working assiduously in collaboration with Embassies,\u201d David said.\n\nMr Mike Oputteh, Welfare Officer of NUNAI, also appreciated the federal government, the Nigerian Ambassador to Italy, Mfawa Abam, and the Immigration attache to the Mission for their response.\n\nOputteh said that Amb. Abam and the Immigration Attach\u00e9 to the mission have been working tirelessly to ensure the challenges of scarcity of passports is solved to ameliorate the plight of Nigerians living in Italy.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware of the challenges the Nigeria Immigration Service is experiencing, which is not only affecting Nigerians in Italy but even those living in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe supply of booklets to Italy is not regular, but there are cases where the Embassy gets 1,000, gets 500, gets 2,000.\n\n\u201cAfter we have made a passionate appeal to the two Ministers, the Comptroller General of Immigration, we have started getting supply.\n\n\u201cBefore the Christmas we got supply of about 1,500 because I work closely with the Immigration and they promised to give us more, they are talking of giving us 10,000 booklets to clear the backlog.\n\n\u201cThere is an improvement, and the Immigration and the Nigerian mission is working but more need to be done because Nigerians have to renew their passports and get new ones.\n\n\u201cI am using this medium to continue to appeal to the Minister of Interior who have been supporting NUNAI, the Foreign Minister, the Comptroller General of Immigration to please continue to supply us booklets.\n\n\u201cAt least if we can be getting regular supply of 2,000 booklets monthly, it will help us clear backlog but for now, we do not have regular supply,\u201d Oputteh said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Warns Mohammed against garbing himself with Propagandists Toga\n\n***Says insurgents chose Buhari as chief negotiator\n\n***Warns President against propagandist spokesmen\n\nBy Henry Umoru, ABUJA\n\nFORMER Federal Commissioner for information and South-South leader, Chief Edwin Clark has taken a swipe at the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed for saying that if not for President Muhammadu Buhari, terrorists would have declared Nigeria as an Islamic state.\n\nClark who warned Lai Mohammed against garbing himself with propagandists toga as if he was still the National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, urged him to use his office to build bridges among Nigerians, adding that it is not true that President Buhari expelled Boko Haram of 14 Local Government Areas of Borno State.\n\nAccording to the Elder statesman, it was former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration that flushed out Boko Haram insurgents just before the 2015 general elections from the 14 local government areas they held in Borno state as against the claims by the Minister of information, adding that lies are being fabricated against the former President because he was President of Nigeria where some people think they alone have the exclusive right to be that position.\n\nIn a statement yesterday in Abuja, Clark who noted that it was Jonathan\u2019s administration\u2019s action that enabled elections to hold in the areas, said that the minister\u2019s recent statement was fallacious and misleading when he declared that \u201cNigeria would have been an Islamic state without President Mohammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cIt is a blatant falsehood for Alhaji Lai Mohammed to claim that but for President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would have been Islamised, that it was President Buhari government that sent Boko Haram out of the fourteen Local Government Areas in Borno State.\u201d\n\nThe Ijaw leader said that what gave Mohammed the impetus to make the statement is the fact that \u201cNigerians have not dispelled this fraudulent and false claim that it was President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government that expelled the Boko Haram group from the fourteen Local Government Areas of Borno State.\u201d\n\nClark who is the Leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) quoted excerpts from Jonathan\u2019s recent book where the former president narrated how the insurgents were flushed out saying: \u201cAnyhow, the six weeks served us well, we received the military equipment we were expecting within that period and our Armed Forces commendably, dealt a deserving blow on the terrorists and repossessed all territorial areas of Nigeria previously occupied by terrorists. Boko Haram was deflated up to the point of handing over to my successor on 29th May 2015. We concluded the elections peacefully, even if there were issues raised about the fairness, at least the nation was relieved that the election held peacefully and that there was no post-election violence.\u201d\n\nAccording to Clark, no patriotic Nigerian will believe Mohammed\u2019s statement that it was President Buhari that prevented the takeover of Nigeria by Islam, rather, \u201cmost Nigerians have the strong feeling that it is his government that has given or created the environment for the sect to return and be more daring. With all the menacing activities of this group, no armed herdsmen have been arrested. Is it by coincidence?\u201d\n\nHe said Mohammed therefore again, \u201cdecided to garb himself with the propagandist toga, which he used to wear as the Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), forgetting that he is today, the Information Minister of the country, a position which he should use to build bridges between the Federal Government and the people of Nigeria, and across all divides in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Ijaw nationalist recalled that while negotiations were being suggested with the insurgents, they chose then Major Gen. Buhari ad their chief negotiator.\n\nClark added: \u201cSetting the records straight: It is pertinent to reiterate that Boko Haram was expelled from the fourteen Local Government Areas of Borno State by former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government through the engagement of combined forces who were assisted by hired mercenaries.\n\n\u201cPrior to the period the sect was expelled, they were occupying fourteen Local Government Areas in the State. As a matter of fact, it was as a result of this that the elections could not be conducted at the initial scheduled date and had to be postponed.\n\n\u201cIt was this effrontery of making the state not to hold its functions that made the then government take the bull by the horn and flushed out the Boko Haram group out of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not true that it was President Mohammadu Buhari that expelled Boko Haram out of 14 Local Government Areas of Borno State.\n\n\u201cIt must be remembered that some Nigerians believed that the Boko Haram sect will be used to harass and torment President Goodluck Jonathan, getting him out of office.\n\n\u201cEven when it was suggested then that there should be a meeting to see the possibility of having negotiations between the Nigerian state and Boko Haram, the sect chose Gen. Mohammadu Buhari, rtd, as he then was, as their Chief Negotiator, even though a few days after the choice, he (Gen. Buhari), rejected the sect\u2019s choice of him.\n\n\u201cThere were no accusations the APC did not level against President Jonathan then, including criticising him for killing innocent Northerners through the sponsor of Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile all these were fabricated lies from the pit of hell, against an innocent man whose only offence is that he as the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Force of a country, where some people think they alone have the exclusive right to be in that position,\u201d\n\nRecalling the exchange he had with three former northeast governors including Admiral Murtala Nyako of Adamawa State, Kashim Shetima of Borno State and Ibrahim Geidam of Yobe State, on their accusations of Jonathan as the promoter of Boko Haram to kill northerners, he said it was a case of giving a dog a bad name in order to hang it.\n\nClark also recounted some of the statements made by Mohammed against Jonathan after the abduction of Chibok schoolgirls by Boko Haram including accusing his government of being behind the insurgents and Jonathan trying to gain political capital from the release of the school girls.\n\nChief Clark argued: \u201cOn the contrary, one can even adduce that it is Alhaji Lai Mohammed and his co-travellers on this voyage of destroying an innocent President Jonathan, that should be the prime suspects.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the attitude of both the then Borno State Governor, Kashim Shetima of not heeding to the advice of security experts and the Federal Ministry of Education which strongly objected, to relocate the Chibok schoolgirls to another school to write their West African Senior School Certificate (WASSCE) examinations based on security reasons, was bluntly rejected by the Governor, who rather stated that he would provide adequate security for the students, but which of course he deliberately he did not do.\n\n\u201cAnother worrisome aspect about the abduction is how did the abductors get the army uniforms they wore, with which they deceived about 200 school girls that they had come to rescue them. It was reported that the girls thought that the abductors were genuine soldiers because of the uniform they wore. They took away the girls in vehicles, unchallenged.\u201d\n\nAccording to the elder statesman, the gang up against the former president started when former incumbent president Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua fell ill in the office with Jonah as his vice.\n\nClark stated: \u201cThe whole gang up against former President Goodluck Jonathan started when the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua took ill and eventually died on 9th May 2010. It was at this stage that some \u2018prominent\u2019 persons from the North have vowed to themselves that they will not want Dr Jonathan to return to power in 2011, and allegedly started orchestrating all manners of evil, including the fuelling of the activities of the monster called Boko Haram.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAccording to him, the upsurge in Boko Haram\u2019s activities especially their bombing campaign in the federal capital was the most trying time for the Jonathan administration, adding, \u201cDuring this period, the opposition, of which Alhaji Lai Mohammed was one of its arrowheads, as the spokesman, carried out all sorts of propaganda, name-calling, against a sitting President. They ensured that their false and malicious statements made headlines in the news; they had a field day with social media.\n\n\u201cHowever, today, anyone who tries to do 1/100 of what they did or said then, will be guilty of \u2018hate speech.\n\n\u201cPresident Goodluck Jonathan knew that people were out to get at him, in any way, by all means. He even openly stated that Boko Haram had infiltrated his government.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, however, those who never wanted him in office and those who never liked him were basking in joy because their handiwork was succeeding. And actually, nurtured the group to be more daring in any way possible including people who made statements that fanned the embers of their activities, like Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\n\u201cBut like the saying goes what goes around, comes around, they never knew they were raising what is like the proverbial Frankenstein monster. What they created became uncontrollable and returns to haunt them.\n\n\u201cToday, part of Niger State in the North-Central geopolitical zone is occupied by Boko Haram. The Governor of the State, Dr Abubakar Sani Bello, has cried out several times about this. The insurgents have hoisted their flags in parts of the State, collecting levies and taxes from farmers before the latter will not only be allowed to go about their business but also enable them to live in peace.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, on 19th December 40 innocent persons were gruesomely murdered in Kaduna State by terrorists, in a state that has very major state security installations. These are not imaginary persons; they are sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, relatives of persons. In fact, the names of 29 of them were published, the rest were yet to be identified.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, there were rocket explosions at different locations when the President visited Maiduguri. Yet, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Information Minister, is not seeing this; what he keeps seeing in his imagination is his warped images of 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is a blatant falsehood for Alhaji Lai Mohammed to claim that but for President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would have been Islamised, that it was President Buhari government that sent Boko Haram out of the fourteen Local Government Areas in Borno State.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Southern Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) who admonished President Buhari over the utterances of his spokesmen who he stated are the president\u2019s albatross, said, \u201cI want to reiterate that the spokesmen of President Mohammadu Buhari, are his albatross. Their unwarranted attacks, insults, arrogance on opponents, behaving like Paul Joseph Goebbels, the chief propagandist of the Nazi Party of Germany, and one of the closest allies and spokesmen of Adolf Hitler during World War 2.\n\nAs Information Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed should be building bridges, instead of widening and expanding the gulf.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Nwosu: I was accused of supplying arms to militants, causing insecurity in Imo",
          "text": "By Chris Njoku, Owerri, Emma Elekwa, Onitsha, Emmanuel Badejo and Uja Emmanuel, Makurdi\n\nThe 2019 governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA), Chief Uche Nwosu, yesterday said he was arrested by hooded operatives over an allegation that he was an arms supplier to militants and sponsor of the insecurity in Imo State.\n\nNwosu, therefore, called on the Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Usman, to investigate his arrest and the activities of the state Police command.\n\nHe spoke yesterday with reporters at his Owerri. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain had on Monday said the operatives threatened to blow off his head if he resisted arrest.\n\nNwosu was arrested during an outing service in honour of his late mother, Jemamah Nwosu, at St. Peter\u2019s Anglican Church, Eziama-Obaire in Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe incident led to a verbal altercation between the Senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, and the Imo State Government.\n\nNwosu, who is Okorocha\u2019s son-in-law, said that at the Tactical Squad Office, Abuja where he was taken to, he was informed that someone alleged in a petition he was an arms supplier to militants.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey accused me of sponsoring insecurity in Imo state. I want to thank the IGP who intervened and ordered my release,\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to IGP to look into the activities of the police personnel in Imo State because what happened was because it is Uche Nwosu, what about those that are not Uche Nwosu. I am not talking about me what about other Imo youths who have nobody to speak for them.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the IGP to look into this. The IGP is a good person because, without him, something else would have happened to me.\n\n\u201cI was taken to the Tactical Squad Office, Abuja where I was told that someone wrote a petition against me alleging that I supply arms to militants.\u201d\n\nThe former AA governorship candidate said the whole drama was done to humiliate and malign his image.\n\nFurther narrating his experience, he said: \u201cOver 15 masked security operatives jumped into the church. While some rushed to the altar, some came to where I was sitting and ordered me to move or move me. They started shooting and disrupted the sermon that was ongoing. I demanded to know what was going on but they said they had an instruction to bring me.\n\n\u201cThey manhandled me and bundled me into one of the vehicles they came in. One of them ordered me to lie down and one of them placed his leg on my head.\n\n\u201cWhen they drove off, they started making calls in the Hausa Language, and unknown to them, I understand the Hausa Language. They were telling one Shaba who is the chief security officer that they have got me.\n\n\u201cAt Umuaka, they stopped and ordered that I should get down. At that point, I thought they were to assassinate me. They bundled me into another vehicle and they drove off.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to Owerri, three other vehicles drove straight to the government house and the one carrying me drove towards Okigwe Road and I began to ask them where they were taking me to but they never responded to me. They drove towards Okigwe and stopped.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I thought they wanted to assassinate me. They asked me to remove my clothes, handcuffed me, snapped me, made a video, and sent it to the CSO.\n\n\u201cWe continued until we got to Enugu airport where we boarded a charted jet to Abuja. We moved to Force Headquarters and we did an interview. They accused me of sponsoring insecurity in Imo State.\u201d\n\nHe however said that what happened cannot deter him from being who he is or cause him to run away from Imo State.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid and can never be afraid to enter my state. So what happened cannot stop me from entering my state, I am now more courageous because God has delivered me from their hands. If I want to die it is better to die in my state than outside the state. So I am not afraid,\u201d Nwosu added.\n\nLike Nwosu, Okorocha called for an investigation of the Sunday incident, which he said was neither ordered by the state police command nor the Force Headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe however believes that the arrest would pave the way for the unmasking of unknown gunmen who have killed many persons in the state.\n\nOkorocha spoke on Politics Today, a Channels Television live programme monitored by The Nation.\n\nLamenting the manner in which Nwosu was arrested, the former governor raised the alarm that Imo State was fast sliding into Banana Republic where people now live in fear.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in Imo state is really unfortunate and the state is becoming a banana republic and everybody appears to be living in fear. What happened to Uche Nwosu is an aberration and should never happen under our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nOkorocha insisted that those that perpetrated the act were from the Imo State Government House.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s something that has to be unraveled in Imo State and that is unknown gunmen in the state and it appears these men are now getting to be known. And I task the IGP to tell the world the truth on this matter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left for the police and Imo Government Government to unmask who ordered the arrest, paid for a private jet, and directed that Uche be humiliated but the truth will come out \u201d\n\nHowever, the state government yesterday maintained that it has no hand in Nwosu\u2019s ordeal.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba described his allegation as spurious and baseless.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Imo State Government has been drawn to a spurious and baseless allegation by Uche Nwosu who was recently arrested by the police, for a yet to be disclosed crime, that the state government was behind his arrest. This is a malicious concoction, that can only be made up by a drowning man,\u201d Emelumba said in a statement.\n\nHe emphasised that the administration of Hope Uzodimma did not believe in tyranny or lawlessness.\n\n\u201cIt should be emphasized that the government of Senator Hope Uzodimma does not believe in tyranny or lawless behavior as was in the case when Uche Nwosu was the de facto deputy governor of the state,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has said that the arrest of Nwosu was another vindication that it had no hand in the attacks and kidnappings in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThis is another vindication that IPOB and Eastern Security Network (ESN) are not responsible for the numerous attacks, abductions/kidnappings in Imo State contrary to false accusations and propaganda by Hope Uzodinma and his co-travelers,\u201d IPOB said in a statement by its Spokesman, Emma Powerful.\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Imo State has however apologised to the Anglican Church over the invasion of its parish by security operatives.\n\nCAN Chairman in the state, Rev. Eches Divine-Eches, tendered the apology on Monday while addressing reporters in Owerri.\n\nCondemning the action of the policemen, Divine-Eches asked security agencies to ensure they carried out their duty in a professional manner.",

United States (U.S.) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 0.8per cent, to $76.14.\n\nBoth contracts traded at their highest levels in a month, aided by strength in U.S. equities.\n\nShell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) had declared a force majeure on exports of Forcados crude oil after a malfunctioning barge obstructed a tanker path.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe SPDC, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell Plc in Nigerian, declared force majeure on Forcados shipments, effective from 12 noon on Monday, promising that efforts were underway to restore access.\n\nForcados is Nigeria\u2019s sweet crude blend with an average output of about 200,000 barrels a day.\n\nThe shutdown comes a month after Shell said it was restoring flows from its Bonny facility.\n\nLast month, Nigeria regained the top spot in Africa, producing an average of 1.27 million barrels per day (mb/d).\n\nLibya had clinched the top spot in Africa in October with 1.24 mb/d.\n\nThe oil and gas sector accounts for about 10 percent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP and petroleum exports around 86 per cent of revenue, according to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nThe halt in crude shipments from Nigeria\u2019s Forcados will further increase the ongoing issues that have reduced crude oil export sales in recent months.\n\nAlready, Nigeria\u2019s Q3 crude oil production dipped to 1.57mb/d from the 1.61mbl in Q1 of 2021, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThis was contained in the \u201cNigerian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Q3 2021 Report,\u201d obtained by The Nation yesterday.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe nation in the third quarter of 2021 recorded an average daily oil production of 1.57 million barrels per day (mbpd), lower than the daily average production of 1.67mbpd recorded in the same quarter of 2020 by 0.10mbpd and lower than the second quarter 2021 production volume of 1.61mbpd by 0.05mbpd.\u201d\n\nThe NBS said real growth of the oil sector was \u201310.73 per cent (year-on-year) in Q3 2021 indicating an increase by 3.16 per cent points relative to the rate recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020.\n\nGrowth, said the report, increased by 1.92per cent points when compared to Q2 2021 which was \u201312.65 per cent.\n\nOn Quarter-on-Quarter, the Bureau said the oil sector recorded a growth rate of 12.05per cent in Q3 2021.\n\nNBS noted that the Oil sector contributed 7.49per cent to total real GDP in Q3 2021, down from figures recorded in the corresponding period of 2020 and up compared to the preceding quarter, where it contributed 8.73per cent and 7.42per cent respectively.\n\nContinuing, the document said the non-oil sector grew by 5.44per cent in real terms during the reference quarter (Q3 2021).\n\nAccording to the report, this was higher by 7.95per cent point compared to the rate recorded in the same quarter of 2020 and 1.30per cent point lower than the second quarter of 2021.\n\nIt noted that this sector was driven in third quarter mainly by trade, information and communication (telecommunication); other drivers include Financial and insurance (financial institutions); manufacturing (nood, beverage & tobacco); agriculture (crop production); and transportation and storage (road transport), accounting for positive GDP growth.\n\nThe NBS said in real terms, the Non-Oil sector contributed 92.51per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP in third quarter 2021, higher from the share recorded in the third quarter of 2020 which was 91.27 per cent and lower than the second quarter of 2021 recorded as 92.58 per cent.\n\nOil analyst at UBS, Giovanni Staunovo, said support for the oil price rally comes as well from high aggregated production disruptions in Ecuador, Libya and Nigeria and the expectation of another large drop in U.S. crude inventories.\n\nThe three oil producers declared forces majeures this month on part of their oil production because of maintenance issues and oilfield shutdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday that U.S. crude oil inventories are likely to have dropped for the fifth week in a row, while gasoline inventories were seen mostly unchanged last week.\n\nEngland will not face any new COVID-19 restrictions before the end of 2021, British health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday, as the government awaits more evidence on whether the health service can cope with high infection rates.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, pledged to ease a shortage of COVID-19 tests as the Omicron variant threatens to overwhelm hospitals and stifle travel plans.\n\nOmicron-induced staff shortages led to thousands of flight cancellations over the Christmas weekend in the United States.\n\nInvestors are awaiting an OPEC+ meeting on Jan. 4, at which the alliance will decide whether to go ahead with a planned production increase of 400,000 barrels per day in February.\n\nAt its last meeting, OPEC+ stuck to its plans to boost output for January despite Omicron.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe former governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) Chief Uche Nwosu has alleged that his arrest on Sunday at St Peter\u2019s Anglican Church, Eziama Obaire in Nkwere Local Government Area of Imo State, during the outing service of his late mother, Jemimah Nwosu, was intended to kill him.\n\nAddressing newsmen on Tuesday, Nwosu said however that it took the divine intervention of God and the professionalism of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Alkali Baba to save his life.\n\nNwosu who is the son-in-law to the former governor of the State, Rochas Okorocha has also accused the state government of being behind his arrest and subsequent whisk away to Abuja.\n\nHe claimed that the IGP was unaware of his being bundled to Abuja by the security operatives even as he maintained that no invitation was extended to him prior to the arrest.\n\n\u2018I want to thank the Inspector General of Police for showing professionalism, he was never sentimental, I commend him for that.\n\n\u2018I want to thank God because I don\u2019t think their intention was to arrest me but to eliminate me because if their intention was to arrest me, I know the normal police procedure, it would be to bring me to the police command and put up a report that I\u2019ve been arrested and then take me to Abuja, it is not the duty of police attached to the governor to arrest but that of the commissioner of police in the state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u2018Mine was a calculated attempt to eliminate me, but I thank God He spared my life. I want to thank the media, I don\u2019t think it was their intention to fly me to Abuja with the private jet that came to Enugu because it came one hour after we arrived, their intention was never to take me to Abuja because there was never an invitation, they said they send me invitation 3 times and I refused to come.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a law-abiding citizen, all my life as chief of staff to the Government House, I have never been involved in criminality, I have never sponsored any criminal. So when they said I was selling guns to militants I was surprised, as a former commissioner for lands, deputy chief of staff, to be dragged on the floor and treated like a common criminal.\n\n\u2018When we got to Abuja, they took me straight to the Tactical Squad Office where the IGP intervened. I was interviewed. From what I observed, the IGP was not properly briefed. All this drama was the Government House, all the security people I saw were those attached to the Governor of Imo State. They came with a military truck that was part of the governor\u2019s convoy, they came with a Ford jeep that was also part of his convoy.\n\n\u2018My pictures they took was sent to social media. Who authorised them to send the pictures? The IGP, a professional policeman that handled this matter, did not authorise them to send my pictures to social media. so I\u2019m pleading with the IGP to find out who sent out my picture to social media, to find out who paid for the private jet that came to pick me at the Enugu airport and to find out these men who did not respect God and have to desecrate the altar of God and shot; its a sacrilege in the house of God. I appeal to the IGP not to let this incident stop here. He should investigate further.\n\n\u2018When I got to the police tactical office, I was told the same man whose video was viral said I was giving them money to buy arms, and I asked them was that why you people should humiliate me, you should have invited me to know if it\u2019s true or not. I\u2019ve not even touched a trigger let alone supplying arms. I\u2019ve been a law-abiding citizen. These things were all cooked up in Government House to malign my image and humiliate me. I\u2019ve not come out of the trauma why I should be humiliated in such a manner inside the church in front of all the visitors I invited.\u2019\n\nWhen contacted, the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, denied government involvement in the arrest as alleged by Nwosu.",

          "title": "Yoruba nation group unveils App to curb kidnapping in South West",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nIn a bid to strengthen the security architecture of Yorubaland, leader of the apex Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), Prof Banji Akintoye, has unveiled a mobile application and alert system, designed to track kidnapped victims and expose danger anywhere in Yorubaland.\n\nThe mobile application named Pajawiri (emergency) launched in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, according to Akintoye, can also expose criminal elements wherever they are once the victims have the application installed in their phones, irrespective of whether the phone is switched on or off.\n\nHe explained that provision has also been made for Yoruba people that do not have android phones to enjoy the services, saying the security system also has another system called Afinihan, which can be used by those without android phones to link up with those with the full application.\n\nAkintoye, who joined the event via virtual platform, said the emergence of Pajawiri is an evidence that the Yoruba people are too intellectually sophisticated to be subdued.\n\n\u201cWe have now proven to the world that we cannot be captured nor be subdued. We are too intellectually sophisticated to be subdued. These nnovations and intellectual powers are what we will deploy to get ourselves out of the quagmires of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the benefits of the application, Akintoye, in a statement by his Communications Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, said: \u201cEvery person in possession of the Pajawiri App on their telephone will be able to activate it instantly, whenever they find themselves in danger. By activating the App, they will be able to alert their families, their friends and their neighbours that they are in danger and that they need help.\n\n\u201cIn that way, no Yoruba person needs to be alone anywhere on their farms, schools, market places, shops and anywhere else. Any person who finds himself threatened by danger and who is in possession of Pajawiri will be able to alert other persons for help.\n\n\u201cIn short, Yoruba people today, are able now to enjoy security individually and collectively through the use of the App known as Pajawiri. The Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide owes our engineers who have put this together an enormous debt of gratitude. The Yoruba people also owe a lot of gratitude to the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oduduwa, for all the encouragement and support that they have given to these engineers.\n\n\u201cThe creators of this App, Pajawiri, have magnanimously offered to put this App Pajawiri freely at the disposal of every Yoruba person for the next 30 days. That is from now till the 21st of January, 2022. This means that all Yoruba people can have the protection of Pajawiri without paying any fees for the next 30 days.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cAfter that, those who chose to continue to enjoy the protection of Pajawiri will be able to do so with an affordable monthly subscription. That is for those of us who have Smart phones(android, iOS or IPhone). For those of us who do not have smart phones, a hand-held alert device named \u2018Afinihan\u2019, has been designed to work equally as effectively as the Pajawiri on the IPhone.\n\n\u201cAfinihan, a tiny hand-held device that is able to perform wonders. This tiny device has been efficiently tested and will be available for purchase at a small affordable price. The purpose of all these technological provisions, is that the Yoruba nation must carry all its people along in this provision of security.\u201d\n\nOn the ideal features and benefits of the App, coordinator of the Pajawiri Project, Ayobami Abolaji, a United States-based IT expert, explained that the App is a system for warning and protection through an alarm and alert system that will generate protective action for the community and each individual user.\n\n\u201cThe P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App is designed to provide a technological solution or a system that allows people to warn others of impending dangers and arouse established response teams in the communities to stop and prevent various vices such as: kidnapping, raping, armed robbery, arson, theft, accidents, murders and banditry against app users and their community members.\n\n\u201cThe P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App is a technologically savvy information and communication application that alerts and locates the source and flashpoints of dangerous security breaches, where unchallenged massacre of valuable human lives and property are perpetrated. The P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App proffers a modern day means of curbing or permanently alleviating the fear that has gripped the inhabitants of any geographical location and settlements once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe P\u00e0j\u00e1w\u00ecr\u00ec App was designed to be activated through a referral process only, in order to be able to know the identities of the app users and detect suspicious and criminal elements disguising as real users. It will be free to download by any users and will be operational after the referral activated for the new user to have the referral identification.\n\n\u201cAfinihan is an Android and I-Phone (iOS) compatible application device that sends alert signals to the connected phone systems. It is a mobile alarm system that allows those without hand held phones to connect to and alert those with the smart phones and computer devices set up at data command and control centers established at various perimeters in the geographical entities that the app is operating from.\n\nPresent at the unveiling of the app were pioneer Commissioner for Education in Osun State and immediate past chairman of Ilana Omo Oodua, Prof. Wale Adeniran; immediate past general secretary of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, George Akinola; Kayode Akinwande and Akinsola Adejuwon, among others.",

But the people out there who claim they are representing us are they actually representing us? You journalists go and do investigate journalism, you will discover that some people hijacked the process of party primary, down to even the elections.\n\n\u201cIt is only in Nigeria that people easily die in election. Ballot box stuffing and snatching do happen. It is only in Nigeria that terrorists will be busy killing people in their thousands. We don\u2019t have 36,000 police to go and quell the problem of human degradation but when there was an election in Anambra State, Ogun State and elsewhere, how many vehicles were on ground? That tells you \u201cThem own cracy.\u201d They are not ready to let go, Nigeria has become a cow they are milking every day. It is not about the people, it is about what they will get out of the system. It is about corruption, it is about looting, it is about inhumanity to man by the class of people that rule us today.\u201d\n\nThe cleric said the elements of democracy should be for the people to decide who rules them.\n\n\u201cIt must be the voice of the people; democracy is the voice of the majority. How can you explain the flimsy reasons given for not signing the Electoral Act? I think there will be a rethink and the right thing will be done so that for the first time, Nigeria will say there will be free and fair elections. This government cannot deliver anything to Nigerians. How can they not for once give Nigerians an electoral process that is acceptable.\n\n\u201cI am talking to the National Assembly members\u2026I am not talking to Mr. President because he had already told us his mind; that he is not going to sign the electoral bill. The National Assembly should put signatures together to override Mr. President. There is a way we have hijacked the political process in Nigeria. And if the National Assembly wants the people to clap for them, and the name rubber stamp removed from them, it is time to show it. Nigerians are clamouring and crying that the electoral bill be signed into law.

          "text": "Shell, ExxonMobil Face Huge Remediation Costs over Abandoned Onshore Assets\n\n\u2022Aiteo considers options against multinational oil company over Nembe spill\n\n\u2022Sector not ripe for full-blown deactivation processes, says industry regulator\n\n\u2022Stakeholders want enforcement of rules\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nShell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria and ExxonMobil are presently faced with huge remediation costs over their failure to properly decommission and cap oil and gas assets across the Niger Delta, especially the ones sold to Nigerians in recent divesture programmes. A situation that creates severe environmental risks and pollution to host communities in the oil-rich Niger Delta.\n\nTHISDAY gathered from stakeholders that the recent case of Aiteo\u2019s Nembe wellhead blowout, brought to the fore the need to enforce the relevant laws and to ensure that the multinationals that sold the assets to the Nigerian companies pay remediation charges.\n\nWhile Aiteo is presently engaged in a legal tussle with Shell, seeking the sum of over $2.5 billion compensation over the sale of Oil Mining Licence 29, THISDAY gathered that the Nigerian oil and gas company is also considering fresh legal action against the multinational over the Nembe spill and other wells not properly capped.\n\nOn the other hand, Seplat Energy Plc last month announced that together with its partner, that it was in competitive discussions to acquire ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian shallow water business. With this, stakeholders have expressed concern about what would happen if the deal is sealed and some of the ExxonMobil\u2019s assets that were not properly capped causes another environment challenge.\n\n\u201cThe present environment challenge is what is likely going to be faced when Shell sells it entire SPDC oil blocs in the Niger Delta without properly capping the oil wells and providing for remediation\u201d an oil and gas expert who pleaded to remain anonymous stated.\n\nFindings by THISDAY have revealed that many of the oil and gas assets sold to Nigerians, mostly by the International Oil Companies (IOCs), are rarely decommissioned or properly abandoned, a development that clearly breaches existing laws regulating the industry.\n\nDecommissioning is the cessation of operations at an oil and gas platform and returning the seafloor to its pre-production state for installations and any relevant structures that have come to the end of their productive life.\n\nOnshore decommissioning involves capping oil wells, clean-up and taking out all production and pipeline risers that are sustained by the platform, removing the platform and getting rid of it in a junk storage area or manufacturing yard.\n\nInternational conventions guiding decommissioning operations include the Geneva Convention on the continental shelf, 1958; United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982; and Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matters, 1972.\n\nBut despite extant regulations and the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), THISDAY learnt that there was rarely any adherence to full decommissioning for the infrastructure that had been sold and there might be no such arrangements for those for which buyers were being sought.\n\nAccording to Section 232, (1) of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), \u201cThe decommissioning and abandonment of petroleum wells, installations, structures, utilities, plants and pipelines for petroleum operations on land and offshore shall be conducted in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice.\u201d\n\nIn Section, 233 (1), the new law affirms, \u201cEach lessee and licensee shall set up, maintain and manage a decommissioning fund held by a financial institution that is not an affiliate of the lessee or licensee, in the form of an escrow account accessible by the commission.\n\n\u201cThe decommissioning and abandonment fund shall exclusively be used to pay for decommissioning and abandonment costs. Where a lessee or a licensee fails to comply with the decommissioning and abandonment plan, the decommissioning and abandonment fund shall be accessed by the commission to pay for the performance by a third party.\u201d\n\nArising from one of the deals, Aiteo recently claimed in a suit that it paid $799 million to Shell for the acquisition of the NCTL pipelines and the assets and that $389.6 million had been lost by the company as a result of the leakages in the pipelines and the degraded conditions of the asset.\n\nAiteo also claimed that $933 million had been expended for the repairs of the pipelines and acquisition of equipment, including well-heads, generators, and pumps, as well as replacement of the flow lines within the NCTL, which it bought from Shell.\n\nIt was learnt that the big oil companies had continued to sell \u201cdead\u201d assets to the country\u2019s local businessmen under the guise that they could no longer cope with militancy or community issues, especially in the Niger Delta.\n\nWhat they have not told buyers is that there would be huge remediation cost down the line from over 30 to 40 years of neglect.\n\nThe recent case of Aiteo\u2019s Nembe wellhead blowout, stakeholders said, brought to the fore the need to enforce the relevant laws and implement proper shutdowns of oil and gas assets in the abandonment and restoration process. Many experts believe that if the wellhead was properly and permanently plugged and decommissioned, since it was not commercially viable, the blowout that happened in Nembe would have been avoided.\n\nIt is believed that Nigeria\u2019s transitory regulatory environment and inability of the authorities to strengthen environmental and petroleum laws for the deactivation of abandoned wells and aging oil facilities have also not helped matters.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the immediate past Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), Nigeria Council, Joe Nwakwue, stated that the availability of regulations had not always been the problem, but enforcement. However, he explained that it was not wholly an IOC issue, noting that there are usually agreements with whoever is buying non-producing assets on steps to take to decommission them.\n\nNwakwue said, \u201cThere are regulations around assets that are no longer in use and it has nothing to do with the transfer of the assets. So, whether it\u2019s Shell or Aiteo, for instance, there are rules.\n\n\u201cWhen a wellhead is no longer producing, there are two steps: it is either there\u2019s a TP&A, which is to temporarily plug and abandon it or you permanently plug and abandon.\n\n\u201cThe problem was that neither of those happened, so that means that it was still theoretically operational. There was need to have abandoned the well when it was no longer in use. That didn\u2019t happen and that\u2019s why we had that spill.\u201d\n\nHe said it did not matter who owned the assets because transfer was a different issue entirely, which should not be mixed up with the decommissioning process.\n\nAccording to Nwakwue, \u201cWhat happened to the commitments? When you talk about asset transfer you\u2019re talking about decommissioning commitment, because when you are selling the assets that\u2019s when the issue of who should decommission will come in because it goes into the pricing.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m buying an asset from you with what is called retirement obligation, I will have to deduct that cost from what I will pay you. I am sure that Shell transferred its commitment to Aiteo.\u201d\n\nNwakwue maintained that the Aiteo facility was just one of several that had been left without proper decommissioning operation, noting that there are even many more assets that have not been sold.\n\nHe held, \u201cThere might be a lot of wellheads that are no longer producing but they are active, they are exposed to pressure. Whoever owns the asset should have a programme to temporarily abandon them to make them safer.\n\n\u201cThere are regulations, but who is monitoring? That is the question. Who is ensuring that the regulations are followed? Those are the questions that need to be answered.\n\n\u201cThe regulator should step up their game. They need to have a programme where facilities that are not no longer in use are temporarily or permanently abandoned and decommissioned to keep the environment safe.\n\n\u201cIrrespective of who is operating them, the primary issue is that there are regulations that have not been followed through and is important that the commission is alive to those responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSecretary General of the Niger Delta Ethnic Nationalities, Capt. Bassey Henshaw, told THISDAY that the oil companies must clean up the environment they had degraded over the years as well as pay compensation before any talk about leaving their onshore and shallow water operations in the region.\n\nHenshaw said, \u201cWe do not dispute the fact that they can go green or whatever, but there has to be some closure. You have a business running and there are issues emanating from those businesses. You do not wake up and say you are going green. All the issues have to be fixed and resolved.\n\n\u201cWe cannot hold them to ransom if they want to leave, but they have to have a closure of the previous business they have done, the degradation of the environment, the oil spillages and all.\u201d\n\nAn oil industry enthusiast, who had covered the sector widely, Ms Ijeoma Nwogwugwu, wrote in a recent article, \u201cAs a result, oil multinationals that want to avoid spending several millions of dollars on decommissioning, have taken advantage of the loopholes by selling their oil assets, including aging and rusting infrastructure, to local oil firms.\n\n\u201cSince the late 2000s, Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have sold their stakes in about 20 to 25 oil blocks to local oil operators at ridiculously exorbitant prices.\n\n\u201cAll the acquisitions were leveraged buyouts that left several Nigerian banks with massive exposures to the oil and gas sector. Many of the loans are yet to be repaid to date.\u201d\n\nNwogwugwu said one way to avoid this debacle was to adopt what obtains in other jurisdictions where it is mandatory, prior to asset sale, for prospective bidders to possess the wherewithal to decommission aging oil and gas infrastructure. She mentioned the $3 billion sale of the Bass Strait operation in Australia, as a case in point.\n\nBut in a reaction, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the industry regulator, stressed that the industry was not mature enough for wholesale decommissioning activities.\n\nHead, Health Safety and Environment, NUPRC, Mr Afeez Balogun, told THISDAY that for divested assets, the buying companies were always encouraged to look holistically at the liabilities and factor them into the purchase arrangements.\n\nAccording to Balogun, \u201cThe premise for full-blown decommissioning is not yet there in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as many of the assets still have long mileage to offer. Add to that the fact that we are currently investing technology for improved oil recovery that will save a lot of costs and further increase the mileage of these assets.\n\n\u201cSo, there is really no crisis, as many uninformed people would want to assume. However, for divested assets, the buying companies are always encouraged to look holistically at the liabilities and factor that into the purchase arrangements.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the divesting companies are currently the big ones that have JV agreements with NNPC, and we are aware that decommissioning arrangements with the companies are being put in place.\u201d\n\nHowever, he stated that the PIA was now more explicit and gave more strength and bite to the rudimentary regulations that the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) already had in place.\n\n\u201cSo, before we reach a crisis level, if we ever will, all these arrangements should have given us adequate protection to make things easier,\u201d Balogun said.\n\n\u201cWe are also watching and are set to tap from all the numerous innovations being brought about by the developed world on decommissioning on all fronts, including environmental and legal considerations, technology, service provision and financing,\u201d he added.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, recently said the federal government would carefully scrutinise oil companies that would bid for the takeover of assets that Shell and other oil majors will be divesting from in the country.\n\n\u201cIn the past, companies were just allowed to buy assets that they had no capacity to operate.

          "text": "\u2022US CDC shortens recommended COVID-19 isolation, quarantine time\n\nMore than 2,800 flights were cancelled yesterday as COVID-19 cases surged across the globe.\n\nThis was just as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention yesterday shortened the recommended times that people should isolate when they\u2019ve tested positive for COVID-19 from 10 days to five days if they don\u2019t have symptoms \u2013 and if they wear a mask around others for at least five more days.\n\nHowever, of the more than 2,800 cancelled flights, around 1,000 were within, into or out of the United States, according to FlightAware. Almost 11,000 flights are delayed.\n\n\u201cThe nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation,\u201d a United memo obtained by CNN disclosed.\n\nAccording to the CNN, globally, airlines cancelled more than 6,000 flights on Christmas Eve, Christmas and the day after Christmas. In the United States, more than 1,200 flights were cancelled and more than 5,000 were delayed on Sunday alone as staff and crew call out sick.\n\nThe cancellations come at the busiest time of year for air travel. The US Transportation Security Administration said it screened millions of people each day over the holiday weekend, peaking at 2.19 million travelers on Thursday, December 23. On Wednesday, more people passed through TSA checkpoints than on the same day in 2019.\n\nAlaska Airlines, which cancelled 133 flights of 19 per cent of its operations Monday, attributed its cancellations and delays on winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. The airline said it cancelled almost 250 mainline flights scheduled to arrive or depart from Seattle Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has the most delays and cancellations in the world, according to FlightAware.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working as quickly as possible to get all our affected guests rebooked on other flights, while operating safely,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement. \u201cReservations is experiencing extremely long hold times of up to 11 hours.\u201d\n\nSaturday air travel was a bit slower because of the flight cancellations: More than 1.53 million people passed through security checkpoints Saturday.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) said last week it had to cancel hundreds of flights because it lacked enough crew members to safely fly all of its scheduled routes.\n\nDelta (DAL) said it was working to get all stranded travelers home as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans,\u201d Delta said in a statement. \u201cDelta people are working hard to get them to where they need to be as quickly and as safely as possible on the next available flight.\u201d\n\nEuropean airlines also experienced a small number of cancellations amid record-breaking numbers of COVID-19 cases in several European nations.\n\nA British Airways spokesperson told CNN yesterday that the airline had cancelled, \u201ca number of flights due to operational constraints,\u201d and were instead using larger aircrafts, where possible, to get customers to their destinations. According to tracking website FlightAware, 46 flights from British Airways were cancelled yesterday.\n\nVirgin Atlantic told CNN flying continues \u201cas scheduled,\u201d noting the exception of one of their London Heathrow \u2014 New York JFK rotations which saw cancellations on December 21.\n\nA Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told CNN: \u201cWe continue to take pre-emptive measures to uphold operational and staffing resilience, always putting the health and safety of our customers and people first.\u201d\n\nAlso, German airline, Lufthansa, said it would cancel 10 per cent of its winter flight schedule as the pandemic continues to hit the aviation industry.\n\nIn an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung last week, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said that due to \u201ca sharp drop in bookings\u201d the airline will have to cancel 33,000 flights from mid-January to February 2022 or 10% of the group\u2019s winter flight schedule.\n\nSpohr\u2019s comments were confirmed to CNN by the Lufthansa press office.\n\nMeanwhile, the CDC also shortened the recommended time for people to quarantine if they are exposed to the virus to a similar five days if they are vaccinated and often to no time if they are boosted.\n\n\u201cGiven what we currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation from 10 days for people with COVID-19 to 5 days, if asymptomatic, followed by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others,\u201d CNN quoted a CDC statement to have disclosed.\n\n\u201cThe change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after. Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for five days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimise the risk of infecting others,\u201d it added.\n\nQuarantine refers to the time people stay away from others if they are exposed to a disease but not yet testing positive or showing symptoms.\n\nCDC changed those recommendations, too.\n\n\u201cFor people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose (or more than two months after the J&J vaccine) and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for five days followed by strict mask use for an additional five days,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, if a 5-day quarantine is not feasible, it is imperative that an exposed person wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure. Individuals who have received their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure, but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure. For all those exposed, best practice would also include a test for SARS-CoV-2 at day 5 after exposure. If symptoms occur, individuals should immediately quarantine until a negative test confirms symptoms are not attributable to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022New rate almost doubles 2021 budget benchmark of $40pb\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nOil prices rose over three per cent yesterday on hopes that the Omicron COVID-19 variant would have limited impact on global demand in 2022, even as surging cases caused flight cancellations in some countries.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude rose $2.59, or 3.40 per cent, to $78.73 a barrel yesterday, while the United States West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.01, or 2.7 per cent, to $75.80 a barrel.\n\nPrices of oil which had plunged by more than 10 per cent on November 26, when reports of a new variant first appeared, started to gain last week after early data suggested that Omicron could cause a milder level of illness.\n\nAlthough the variant had been spreading faster than any COVID-19 variant yet, there\u2019s been some relatively relieving news that most people infected with Omicron showed mild symptoms so far.\n\nHowever, more than 1,300 flights were cancelled by US airlines on Sunday as COVID-19 reduced the number of available crews while several cruise ships had to cancel stops.\n\nThis caused disruption to the supply of goods and services from isolating workers, notably air travel, although the global recovery story for 2022 still remains on track.\n\nBrent has risen by more than 45 per cent this year, supported by recovering demand and supply cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+.\n\nOn January 4, the producer alliance would decide whether to go ahead with a planned 400,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) production increase in February, but the cartel has so far stuck to its plans at its last meeting to boost output for January despite Omicron.\n\nOPEC has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by the 400,000 bpd each month, with Nigeria lagging behind for months.\n\nBut the country, a very active OPEC member had said even if prices fell to between $50 to $60, it won\u2019t be much of an issue, with the country\u2019s oil benchmark for the 2021 budget being $40.\n\nNigeria has failed for months to meet its allocation, due largely to waning investment, ageing upstream infrastructure and disruptions by some local host communities.\n\nBut the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) last week assured that by the year\u2019s end, Nigeria should be able to produce about 1.7 million bpd. That target now looks almost impossible.\n\nOn December 22, Nigeria\u2019s federal lawmakers approved a N17.126 trillion ($38 billion) budget for 2022, anchored on an oil price benchmark of $62 per barrel.\n\nThe approved oil price assumption was higher than the $57 per barrel price that President Muhammadu Buhari had proposed to the parliament on October 7, and also higher than the oil price benchmark of $40 per barrel adopted by the government for the 2021 budget.\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the increase in oil price was to reflect the current market values of the oil barrel in the international market and to generate more funds for critical sectors of the economy.\n\nHowever, the parliament retained the oil production target of 1.88 million bpd, including condensate production of between 300,000-400,000 bpd, for the purpose of its revenue calculation in 2022.\n\nThis compared to the output target of 1.86 million bpd the government had set for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nIn all, oil exports account for around 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange revenue, although the country has battled with a sharp drop in revenue amid a drop in production.\n\nNigeria has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million b/d of crude and condensate, but in recent months its output has been languishing below 1.55 million bpd.\n\nIn November, the NNPC was only able to contribute about N10.5 billion of its projected N122 billion to the federation account jointly run by the federal, state and local governments in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is distributed legally and illegally to other parts of Nigeria, especially Edo and Kano states.\n\nUnder a 2018 Nigerian government policy, Tramadol is a restricted pharmaceutical product used to treat severe pain and be administered only through prescription by medical professionals.\n\nDespite this, it is widely imported, smuggled and used \u2013 particularly among young people \u2013 for recreational and non-medical purposes. Health experts warn that this constitutes a threat to health security in the country.\n\nAhmed Yakasai, the former president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, told ENACT that Tramadol's rebranding for shipment into Nigeria had been ongoing for some time.\n\nHe said there was \"a criminal collaboration between some pharmaceutical companies in Asia, especially India, and criminal gangs in Nigeria that import Tramadol in concealed brands into the country.\" Examples include Tapentadol, an opioid medication used to treat severe pain.\n\nReasons for the rebranding include crackdowns by regulatory agencies over the past two years.

          "text": "Manufacturers in India have rebranded the opioid Tramadol to Tafrodol to evade detection by customs officials at Nigeria's ports and borders, a report by Enactafrica has revealed.\n\nWhile the name change makes the drug look like Tramadol, Tafrodol contains two ingredients that should not be combined and can reportedly cause respiratory infection, coma and even instant death.\n\nThe rebranding comes shortly after several shipments of Tramadol were seized at Nigeria's border posts.\n\nIn August 2020, the Nigeria Police Force, Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) intercepted 33 containers of Tramadol shipped from India worth N1.3 trillion in three different locations in Lagos.\n\nAnalysis by the ENACT organised crime project found that Lagos serves as a major market for Tramadol originating from Asia and shipped in through Cotonou in Benin. It is distributed legally and illegally to other parts of Nigeria, especially Edo and Kano states.\n\nUnder a 2018 Nigerian government policy, Tramadol is a restricted pharmaceutical product used to treat severe pain and be administered only through prescription by medical professionals.\n\nDespite this, it is widely imported, smuggled and used \u2013 particularly among young people \u2013 for recreational and non-medical purposes. Health experts warn that this constitutes a threat to health security in the country.\n\nAhmed Yakasai, the former president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, told ENACT that Tramadol's rebranding for shipment into Nigeria had been ongoing for some time.\n\nHe said there was \"a criminal collaboration between some pharmaceutical companies in Asia, especially India, and criminal gangs in Nigeria that import Tramadol in concealed brands into the country.\" Examples include Tapentadol, an opioid medication used to treat severe pain.\n\nReasons for the rebranding include crackdowns by regulatory agencies over the past two years. In November 2018, 581 million Tramadol tablets, worth over N241 million and weighing about 118 metric tons, were seized in Lagos by NDLEA.\n\nIn June 2020, customs seized 379 packs of Tramadol worth over N56 million in Kaduna. These efforts have been complemented by restrictions on the movement of people and goods due to COVID-19.\n\nAs a result, the quantity of Tramadol in circulation across Nigeria has plummeted, causing demand and prices to rise.\n\nDr Ibrahim Abdul Abubakar, NDLEA head in Kano State, told ENACT that a 20 kg pack of Tramadol sells for as much as N20 million in Nigeria, especially on the black market.\n\nIt's popular among armed insurgents and terror groups from Niger, Mali and Libya for use by their fighters.\n\nOfficials from NDLEA and NAFDAC, who spoke to ENACT on condition of anonymity, say that Tramadol smuggling persists despite all measures because of the involvement of corrupt officials.\n\n\"Colleagues from sister agencies are involved in this,\" said a senior NDLEA member. He said when other regulatory agencies record seizures at ports, they send cases relating to cannabis and other illicit drugs to NDLEA for prosecution, but rarely for Tramadol.\n\nLagos is a major market for Tramadol originating from Asia and shipped in through Cotonou in Benin.\n\nThis was confirmed by a NAFDAC director, who told ENACT that while some agencies were working hard to address the challenge, others were sabotaging it.\n\nTwo factors enable public sector corruption in smuggling illicit drugs into Nigeria. First, the bribes offered run into millions of US dollars, and second, those who have resisted the offers from the smuggling networks have been threatened or killed, Yakasai said.\n\nBesides the complicity of government officials, the porosity of Nigeria's entry points and national borders facilitate the trade of Tramadol and illicit substances. Beyond rebranding, smugglers 'have learnt to adopt some models of concealment that are yet unknown to law enforcement agencies,' said Abubakar.",

After careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true.\n\n\u201cRather, the proposed amendments entail significant legal, financial, economic and security consequences for all Nigerians, principal among which would be a severe spike in the cost of holding primary elections by parties \u2013 integral to democracies the world over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd who would shoulder these costs? The Nigerian taxpayer of course. And who would benefit? Only the richest of political parties. At a time when the nation is seeking to extricate itself from the economic mire of the worst global health crisis in living memory, whatever other merits the new bill may have, now is not the time for such frivolous spending of public money.\n\n\u201cUntil then, the President will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this Bill.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, the ruling APC is one of those that stand to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties. But it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy.\u201d",
          "summary": "The presidency says the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to reject the electoral act amendment bill is to protect Nigerians.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, said the bill did not seek to enhance the country\u2019s democratic process.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has come under scrutiny from media and political circles.\nOnly the richest of political parties.\n\u201cUntil then, the President will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this Bill.",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021. With a more inclusive funding infrastructure built by GetEquity, this trend promises to continue for Nigeria come 2022.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lighting address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lighting developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "West African e-commerce platforms take local fashion makers global",
          "text": "\u201cI\u2019ve always loved and wanted to wear African prints more here,\u201d says Bami Adenike, expressing her enduring fondness for African wear despite staying close to alluring luxury boutiques in Paris. Adenike, a 28-year-old Nigerian artist, moved to France in 2016 and has mostly bought clothes from French fashion retail stores since relocating due to the prohibitive costs of having custom-made African dresses shipped to Europe.\n\nBy late 2020, when Adenike wanted to update her closet, she discovered a number of online platforms offering to deliver African apparel to Europe, at affordable rates, and took a chance ordering through Fashtracker, a marketplace that connects more than 40 African designers with local and international consumers. Within two weeks, her prints were delivered to her door in Paris by DHL.\n\n\u201cI have to admit I was shocked the dresses were well fitted. I used to spend hours looking through Ankara images on Pinterest without any idea how to get them,\u201d she told TechCabal on a phone call. \u201cNow, it\u2019s become a norm for me to patronise brands from Nigeria and sometimes other West African countries.\u201d\n\nAfrican fashion has in recent times attracted significant media interest from the Global North, partly fueled by megastars\u2014such as Naomi Campbell, Alicia Keys, and Beyonc\u00e9\u2014who occasionally rock clothes designed on the continent. Last year, the latter, a 28-time Grammy award winner, was spotted wearing a patterned dress and wide-leg pants made by Tongoro, a Senegalese brand owned by designer Sarah Diouf.\n\nWhile entertainment celebrities have had a hand in propelling African designers to international fame, Africans in the diaspora like Adenike are the biggest consumers of clothes exported from the continent, with e-commerce platforms\u2014such as Nigeria-based Fashtracker and Ivorian site Afrikrea\u2014playing middlemen.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe African Union Commission defines the African Diaspora as \u201cpeoples of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union\u201d. Globally, this group is spread out across several continents. An estimated 36 million Africans live outside the country of their birth, with just over 50% resident within the continent. The sheer size of the African Diaspora means there\u2019s a large potential market for African fashion collections outside the continent.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal for this article, Fashtracker founder and CEO Wunmi Akinsola revealed the platform was originally built to serve markets in Africa. But that changed when the team realised more traction was coming from outside the continent than within. \u201cI was only running ads for Nigeria and neighbouring countries, and yet about half of my customers came from other parts of the world. So, it became obvious that there\u2019s a massive market out there,\u201d Akinsola said.\n\nMoulaye Tabour\u00e9, the founder of Afrikrea, grew up in Mali but has lived and worked in several countries. While in Paris, he discovered that the Africans he came across abroad were mostly interested in African fashion items but could not readily access them. That inspired the founding of his online marketplace in 2016 with the ambition to export African culture globally.\n\n\u201cA few months after we launched and had some designers, our close ones noticed we were wearing more African products and got more interested,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cAfrikrea led us to consume more from African businesses, not by solidarity or charity, but out of pure interest.\u201d\n\nThis year, Afrikrea\u2019s community of merchants has carried out almost \u20ac8 million worth of transactions, according to the company\u2019s data, with over 80% of its orders coming from outside the continent\u201440% from Europe and 30% from the US. It claims to record more than 500,000 site visits monthly.\n\nDespite facing stiff competition from several other similar platforms, Tabour\u00e9 believes product diversity has helped Afrikrea grow rapidly, considering the African Diaspora isn\u2019t a monolithic group. \u201cThe black diaspora is the largest in the world and also probably the most heterogeneous. So having a wide array of sellers, products, and experiences to cater to everyone has always been key to our success,\u201d he said.\n\nAfrikrea and its counterparts are increasingly attracting African designers and micro-businesses along the fashion and art value chains that wish to gain awareness among customers outside the continent. Within five years, Afrikrea grew its seller base from 500 to 10,000 across 47 African countries and currently allows them to showcase and sell African-inspired clothing and accessories to 170 countries around the world.\n\nEssentially, these platforms provide a gateway to reach global consumers demanding African fashion collections and handle all the resource-intensive components, including marketing, cross-border shipping, and payments, which would otherwise hinder local fashion designers and dealers from selling outside their national borders.\n\n\u201cAfter launching on Instagram and boosting our post, we started getting a lot of inquiries from people abroad about purchasing items. But there was no way to get things to them effectively,\u201d says John Pelumi Oyedokun, founder and creative director of Mode Vert Limited, a Nigerian company behind fashion label Jon Pelumi, which launched in 2019. Oyedokun then partnered with Fashtracker after Akinsola reached out to him. \u201cAfter signing up [on Fashtracker], we\u2019re able to sell our products to a growing customer base in Ghana, the US, and Canada.\u201d\n\nFor Olakunmi Oni, Lagos-based fashion designer and the founder of minimalist women\u2019s clothing line, 1964 Brand, selling online and shipping abroad was never a problem but admits that listing her brand products on Fashtracker \u201cshows our designs to a much wider audience.\u201d\n\nTypically, designers selling on e-commerce sites can create storefronts and receive payments from anywhere in the world. Once a purchase is made, the platform deducts a commission of 10-15% per sale. For the logistics side of things, Afrikrea, for instance, has a partnership with DHL that allows micro-retailers selling via its platform to ship to their customers for as low as $20 per package. The company also recently launched ANKA, a SaaS e-commerce solution for African fashion designers and merchants, offering a single dashboard to manage multiple sales channels, inventory, and payments.\n\nAnkara dresses are now popular among Africans and non-Africans in Europe and North America, thanks to e-commerce. Photo credit: Umaizi\n\nWhether curators like Afrikrea or single-brand sites such as Ghana\u2019s KIKI Clothing, platforms for African fashion tap into a growing global demand for African designer goods, riding on e-commerce. Africa\u2019s e-commerce opportunity is estimated to be $19.8 billion by Statista, and in terms of general e-commerce activities on the continent, McKinsey & Company estimates consumer spending to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025.\n\nThat presents an opportunity for local retailers to promote African fashion globally, especially with consumers increasingly switching to online shopping amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic. For designers, partnerships with e-commerce platforms transform their otherwise small tailor businesses into fashion brands with global patronage while opening up the $31 billion sub-Saharan Africa clothing market to the rest of the world.\n\nBut scaling globally isn\u2019t without its own challenges. Custom officers mostly within the continent still pose a major constraint to cross-border shipment, especially in the absence of an effective free trade agreement. \u201cInitiatives like the AfCFTA are there but yet to become concrete realities,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 said. He adds that African governments can do more by facilitating customs for people shipping outside of the continent, particularly to Europe. \u201cWe want to take African culture to you wherever you are. Our job is mainly to remain optimistic but pragmatic.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0. Find out a little about them.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Techpoint Africa is a digital media company that amplifies the best innovations out of Africa through its media, data, and events.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Outlook for 2022: Tech founders talk scale after record funding year",
          "text": "Nigerian start-ups cut the biggest slice of a record $4.2 billion investment in Africa tech companies in 2021, marking a pivotal year for the ecosystem experts believe is likely to continue in 2022.\n\nImportantly, the New Year will see the companies with millions of dollars in investments pushing to expand user adoption and solving hard problems in the Nigerian society, experts say.\n\nA report compiled by Maxime Bayen, senior venture builder for Catalyst Fund at BFA Global, and Max Cuvellier, head of Mobile for Development, GSMA, shows that $4.2 billion came from over 800 fundraising deals completed in 2021.\n\nNigerian start-ups reportedly raised a total of $1.7 billion and contributed the most number of unicorns with the likes of OPay and Flutterwave joining the league this year.\n\nHenry Mascot, the co-founder/CEO of Curacel, an African technology start-up creating innovative infrastructure for the insurance sector and which raised $450,000 in March, told BusinessDay that the main contributor to the increased attention in 2021 was due to three high-profiled exits that took place towards the end of 2020.\n\nOne of the exits was the acquisition of Paystack by Stripe. ROAM also acquired Jobberman. These acquisitions brought the validation foreign investors who were once sceptical of the possibilities of exit for African businesses were looking for. In 2021, the investors doubled down on funding the tech companies in the country.\n\nFor Femi Adeyemo, founder/CEO of Arnegy, a distributed utility company, another reason there has been so much success over the past few years is down to tackling issues around access to essential goods and services. This should remain a core part of the company\u2019s strategy in 2022.\n\nWhile the number of very large deals grew in 2021, the number of smaller (pre-seed) deals has exploded. 2021 also saw an increase in the number of organisations actively investing in startups in Africa, which doubled from 2020 to reach more than 810.\n\n\u201cDuring the second half of 2021, we have seen a large number of Africa-focused VCs closing new funding, meaning this additional money will be deployed over the coming years,\u201d Maxime Bayen says. \u201cI am quite confident the trend we have seen in 2021 will continue in 2022. When you compare with other regions, in 2021, while startups in Africa have raised $4.2 billion, startups in India have raised more than $27 billion and startups in Latin America closed over $12 billion. Things have just started for the continent.\u201d\n\nFunding links to market maturity\n\nIgnatius Akpabio, head of growth and strategy, TradeDepot, says the funding is indicative of the maturity of the tech ecosystem in Nigeria, which now attracts a material share of high-growth capital and top-quality talent.\n\n\u201cHaving multiple well-funded players all playing their part in driving innovation is a good sign of how far the ecosystem has come. There is, however, still quite a journey to travel and we are excited to see what the coming years will bring,\u201d Akpabio states.\n\nCelestine Omin, chief technology officer at Alta Labs, says the maturity of the ecosystem was evident in the increased involvement of local investors in the funding scene.\n\n\u201cWe have grown to the point where local investors are taking as much as 50 to 70 percent in investment rounds as opposed to when almost everyone in a particular round was from abroad,\u201d Omin notes.\n\nFor Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, founder/general partner at Future Africa, a fund that connects investors to mission-driven startups, the highlight of the investments in 2021 is the diversity and spread, which was not the case 10 years ago when the ecosystem was just beginning.\n\n\u201cFounders with more diverse backgrounds are getting funding,\u201d he states. Noting, \u201cThere is an explosion of remote work and technical talent. The government has even acknowledged our contributions by working with us to do more with the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSB). Quite a lot has changed and I hope the current progress continues.\u201d\n\nThe NSB is a joint initiative by Nigeria\u2019s tech startup ecosystem and the Presidency to harness the potential of the digital economy through co-created regulations. The bill plans to ensure that Nigeria\u2019s laws and regulations are friendly, clear, planned, and work for the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn December, the minister of communications and digital economy, Isa Ali Pantami said it had been approved by the Federal Executive Council and was now making its way to the National Assembly.\n\nAboyeji says he expects that the bill will be passed by lawmakers in 2022 and that states across the country will domesticate the NSB.\n\nDiverse funding, diverse focus\n\nThe funding diversity meant that startups in other sectors of the Nigerian economy also got attention from investors. Some of the sectors include healthcare, energy, automotive, education, and agriculture. Some of the funding announcements in these sectors were record-setting. For example, uLesson\u2019s $15 million Series B raise in December was the largest investment in an edtech company in Africa.\n\nIkenna Nzewi, CEO/co-founder of Releaf, an agritech startup that landed $4.2 million in funding in September 2021, says the focus should now be on reaching more consumers located outside the cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. While these cities represent immense opportunities, the jobs and wealth they see are limited to the cities.\n\n\u201cOur rural communities already play a key role in providing the largest proportion of jobs and an increasing share of the food we eat. By innovating around the opportunities that already exist in these communities and developing technology solutions for longstanding problems, we can catalyse long-term growth across the nation,\u201d Nzewi says.\n\nAgroEknor, a floriculture company that exports hibiscus flowers grown in Nigeria, got funding from Aruwa Capital Management. Timi Oke, AgroEknor\u2019s executive director, Operations and Strategy, tells BusinessDay that increased adoption of technology in the agric sector could rake in an additional $500 billion to the global gross domestic product by 2030. Nigeria and Africa can contribute a significant proportion of this due to the nature of the challenges that currently impact the agriculture ecosystem.\n\nHowever, with all the funding, nearly all the tech companies face tough business operations with Nigeria\u2019s grossly low power generation capacity. Currently, 43 percent of Nigerians do not have access to electricity from the national grid. The World Bank estimates the country loses $26.2 billion each year due to a lack of reliable power.\n\nFemi Adeyemo states the COVID-19 pandemic led many people to work from home and made them realise the critical place of reliable energy sources. This led to a rise in demand for Arnegy\u2019s services. The company has now developed a proprietary Solarbase platform on the cloud to enable full access and monitoring of the database to ensure there is no disruption for customers when they are working from home.\n\nRead also: Alitheia hits $100m funding target to power female-led African startups\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAlthough there are concerns in the founders\u2019 community that the $1.7 billion raised might be too much and tech companies may not be able to make returns, Henry Mascot says it is still good for the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cTime has also shown that investors still win even if not all of them,\u201d Mascot states.\n\nGoing forward, a few areas that tech companies can focus on in 2022 include automation, leveraging artificial intelligence to drive business efficiency and continuity, according to Adeyemo. This is especially useful for generating data that provide an in-depth analysis of the markets the companies are in. He sees the complete digitalisation of businesses as being able to provide improved customer experiences, where the entire customer journey is seamless, easily tracked, and measured.\n\nThe founders acknowledge that COVID-19, which continues to be a major headache for the rest of the world, would play a role in the direction of funding in 2022.\n\nHowever, Timi Oke says there is too much momentum behind the current wave of innovations with signs suggesting that the investment attracted in 2021 will continue to rise in 2022.\n\nMascot and Nzewi also agree that the pandemic will not reduce capital allocation; instead, it will reinforce the need for it. In 2020, the lockdown imposed as a result of the pandemic only led to increased adoption of tech innovations and accelerated digitisation.\n\n\u201cSome reports actually predict a sharp acceleration with funding for African tech companies expected to exceed $10 billion in 2025, and we believe the current trends we observe support this,\u201d notes Akpabio of TradeDepot.\n\nThe major need still lies in using technology to improve the quality of life of millions of Nigerians. For long-term impact, Aboyeji and Akpabio say it is critical to partner the universities and the broader academic institutions to train more talent as well as leverage data and tools that are emerging across different sectors to drive further innovation, refine products and services, and reach new users.\n\nThere is also the intersection of technology and government policies. In 2021, many tech companies began to prioritise engagement with regulators. Some companies like Flutterwave went as far as bringing experienced people to handle new positions that interface with the government.\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in quality data for targeting our customers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to invest in product design and research that enables us to build products that are culturally aware and meet the people where they are. We need to partner with legacy companies to improve our distribution channels and build trust with consumers. There is so much to do so we can serve the people.\u201d",

          "text": "As the world battles a new variant of COVID-19 just a few months after it seemed as though global travel was recovering, the uncertainties around travel are already making people set trends on how they want to travel in the coming year.\n\nTravel and tour companies are keeping a watch on these trends to build and adapt their products, and to help their clients to be prepared for the changing demands from travellers.\n\nThe resurgence of COVID-19 is accentuating the alteration of social and business norms and interactions, while also becoming tiresome.\n\nDaniel Batchelor, vice president, Global Corporate Communications and Social Responsibility, says, \u201cWith vaccines and digital health passports now making the rounds, we can finally begin looking forward to new adventures, both near and far.\u201d\n\nSeyi Adewale, CEO \u2013 Mainstream Cargo Limited, tells BusinessDay that the trend for 2022 will continue to include increase in diplomatic spat because of this resurgence, flight restrictions, forced isolation in government centres, huge levies on Covid related remedial or mitigating actions, cancellation of major global events and limited powers of global institutions to prevail on sovereign states for harmonised Covid approach.\n\nAdewale says the reaction of individuals, families and indeed businesses is to postpone planned travels and send money to loved ones rather than the preferred physical travels as experienced in the now resolved UK-Nigeria red listing \u2018brawl.\u2019 This has discouraged many travellers both ways.\n\nDespite these obvious realities, here are key travel trends that will shape travel in year 2022:\n\nReduction in business travel\n\nThere are indications that business trips will be reduced as countries may increase the cost of tourists in a bid to cushion the effect of losses incurred from reduced business trips.\n\nRead also: Omicron: Nigerian travellers lament over treatment by Ghanaian government\n\nAccording to Adewale, for businesses, online meetings and conferences appear to now be the norm as so many consulates worldwide are operating below capacity in order to tame the Covid spread, and this has hampered travellers who now have to wait several months beyond the ordinary for travel visas.\n\nShort-haul destinations\n\nCOVID-19 has made many people keen to travel within the country or to short-haul destinations. If there is any chance of a global lockdown, they would not be stuck far from home. Besides, travel restrictions, including testing requirements and quarantine, are also forcing people to opt for domestic travel or within the same region.\n\nPrashant Pitti, co-founder, EaseMyTrip, says his company found that people are making the most of long weekends where bookings are up by nearly 60 percent, such as during Dasara.\n\nKojo Bentum-Williams, UNWTO senior expert on communications, says, \u201cWe are effectively providing a focused and thematic tourism development agenda for building strong domestic tourism economies, health, online and offline safety and security, sustainability thinking, and talent development in the tourism industry and the AfCFTA.\n\nTravel by chartered planes\n\nAnother noticeable feature is that the demand for travelling by chartered planes is also on the rise. Sachit Wadhwa, co-founder, BookMyCharters, says his company has seen a rise in inquiries now compared to pre-Covid times, pointing out that wedding charters are also in demand, especially between November and March.\n\n\u201cIndeed, government activities such as the recently concluded IATF Conference in South Africa needed the intervention of states to fast track visa issuance, charter private jets (flights) to convey delegates to this event as an example and growing trends that was also experienced during the Arise Fashion Event in Dubai,\u201d Adewale explains.\n\nDomestic tourism/travel\n\nThe driving force behind the recovery of the tourism industry and the local economy; domestic tourism is what travel experts believe will be the first step and leading role in 2022 trends in the travel industry.\n\nExploring closer to home is the final piece of the puzzle. With travel bubbles on hold, travelling closer to home is the perfect way to itch that travel bug while having as little impact as possible. Better yet, travellers can get to know their own country a little more and visit those places that they have always wanted to see.\n\nWith outdoor experiences being hot on the trends, a traveller taking their own car adds to the experience with the chance to really immerse themselves in nature, maybe even camping too.",

          "text": "As the real return on investment across many Nigerian instruments remained in the negative following a high inflation rate that exceeded yields on many asset classes, there is a need for investors to explore some strategies to reap from the opportunities that may arise in 2022, findings by Businessday have shown.\n\nAfter hitting more than 17 months-high at 9.75 percent on May 14, 2021, yields on the less-risky Federal Government Treasury Bills (T-Bills) dropped to 5 percent on December 15, the lowest in 10 months.\n\nThe performance of T-bills in the review period was similar to other instruments. Investors expect T-Bills rates to plunge further in the first quarter of 2022 before picking up in the second quarter of next year.\n\nFollowing the failed attempts in 2021 to get high returns from the risk-free government instruments and other investments, fixed income investors redirected some of their funds to the more attractive banks\u2019 placement and commercial paper (CP), according to BusinessDay findings.\n\nCiting where investors were redirecting their investment, Ayo Ebo, Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham said \u201ca lot of corporates have been issuing commercial paper at attractive rates.\u201d This is coupled with \u201cplacement with banks that also comes at an attractive return.\n\nFrom a total asset under management at N1.49 trillion at the beginning of 2021, the Nigerian mutual fund industry shed N220.18 billion to record N1.27 trillion as of December 10, 2021, as analysed from the data by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nMoney market and bond funds took the front seat among peers that recorded a decline in their net asset value (NAV) in the review period. Both funds shade N702.77 billion and N220.11 billion, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Mixed/balanced and Equity-based funds led other mutual fund asset classes as their net asset value increased by N514.15 billion and N241.80 billion, respectively.\n\nRead also: Google\u2019s first investment from African fund goes to transport startup, SafeBoda\n\nInvestment analysts at financial advisory firm, Afrinvest expect that next year a mix of fundamental and market sentiment will drive market activities across regions of the world, markets, and even asset classes.\n\n\u201cWe think the investment landscape is going to be driven by both fundamentals especially coming from the recovery that we have seen in 2021 from the dip of 2020,\u201d Robert Omotunde, chief investment officer, Afrinvest, said.\n\nLooking at the key themes that are likely to shape the investment landscape for 2022, Afrinvest identified the following investment pointers that can guide investors towards an appropriate investment strategy next year.\n\nCautious optimism\n\nIn the euphoria of economic recovery, investment analysts at Afrinvest advise investors to be cautious in their optimism in order not to be caught off guard.\n\n\u201cWe expect investors to be guided by both fundamental and market sentiment.\u201d\n\nMarket timing\n\nTiming and accuracy, according to the Lagos-based financial advisory firm are the two factors that differentiate great investors from informed investors.\n\nThe firm advised that in 2022, it will be better to identify and position investors\u2019 portfolios to benefit from market movement.\n\n\u201cOne of the key things that will differentiate great investors in 2022 is the fact that they can time the market,\u201d it said.\n\nBecause of the fear of different variants of the pandemic, Afrinvest said there will be periods that will present opportunities to buy cheap and it thinks \u201cinvestors can take advantage of this\u201d and so \u201cmarket timing is going to be very crucial as part of the overall theme for investment strategy in 2022.\u201d\n\nStaying liquid\n\nStaying liquid was highlighted as the third strategy for 2022 because the market could present a pocket of opportunities in the year ahead and so \u201ccash is king\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also like to emphasize the need to stay liquid as much as possible,\u201d Omotunde said.\n\nLooking at the model portfolio of Afrinvest for 2022, it showed that it allocated up to 70 percent of its clients\u2019 investment in liquid assets because they believe investors need the flexibility to be able to move in and out of the assets and to take advantage of different opportunities that will arise.\n\nDiversification\n\nIn a time of economic recovery, Afrinvest said it expects investors to diversify across and within assets to minimize risks and improve returns. As a result, it highlighted that diversification remains a key theme of its 2022 strategy.\n\n\u201cDiversification is key within the traditional and alternative assets and even within the specific asset class; there is still can be diversification across corporate, sovereign and even across and within maturities.\u201d\n\nPortfolio rotation\n\nAccording to the advisory firm, 2022 is expected to be a year of policy normalization across the world, as a result, Afrinvest said it believes that investors should rotate from long-term assets to short/mid dated assets as the former is more vulnerable in such period.\n\nBecause of the outlook on the interest rate and the stability that it expects from the overall economy both locally and globally, Afrinvest projects that portfolio rotation will be a very good investment strategy next year from short to long term duration instrument across different asset classes.",

I will not do anything behind your back, as we will sit together to negotiate and make decisions that will benefit us all.\n\n\u201cI am a digital governor; I work with data. Even without delineation by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), no ward in Oredo has less than 25 polling units.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cFor the purpose of appointment, Oredo is now 25 wards, not 12 anymore. It will affect everything else, including the number of Senior Special Assistants (SSAs) and Special Assistants (SAs). Leaders should meet today and finalise the list of political appointees and submit it to me. I will announce the names on the list by 7 pm and the inauguration will be done tomorrow in Government House by 12 noon.\u201d\n\nCharging on politics of inclusion, the governor noted that the target for the party\u2019s e-registration exercise is one million members, adding, \u201cAny party that doesn\u2019t include people to share in its ideology is already a failure as everyone is important to the party.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Senator Representing Edo-South Senatorial District, Sen. Matthew Urghohide reiterated the need for the party to remain one united family, noting that politics is a game of numbers.\n\n\u201cThe vehicle that we are using, which is the PDP, is not the exclusive right of anybody. So, we must work together to build the party,\u201d he charged.\n\n...",

          "text": "The presidency has, once again, given reasons why President Muhammadu Buhari rejected assent to the Electoral Bill 2021.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Tuesday, noted that the President\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has come under scrutiny from media and political circles.\n\nAccording to him, it was quite correct because it is a decision that will impact all Nigerians, saying the President\u2019s Office has decided, therefore, to issue an official statement to make its position clear.\n\nHe explained that Nigeria\u2019s strength as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa with one of its highest standards of living owes all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStating that it is the subsisting Act which the new Bill seeks to amend, Shehu said the amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon the nation\u2019s democratic processes.\n\nAccording to him, after careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true.\n\nHe stated, \u201cRather, the proposed amendments entail significant legal, financial, economic and security consequences for all Nigerians, principal among which would be a severe spike in the cost of holding primary elections by parties \u2013 integral to democracies the world over.\n\n\u201cAnd who would shoulder these costs? The Nigerian taxpayer of course. And who would benefit? Only the richest of political parties. At a time when the nation is seeking to extricate itself from the economic mire of the worst global health crisis in living memory, whatever other merits the new bill may have, now is not the time for such frivolous spending of public money.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cInevitably, the usual voices are making themselves heard, with cynical claims of election rigging and so on. This is nothing new. We heard their self-serving cries of fraud in 2015, when we saw the first peaceful transfer of power in independent Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThen again in 2019, when President Buhari was re-elected with a lead of over three million. We will hear them again in 2023.\n\n\u201cUntil then, the President will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this Bill.\u201d\n\nThe presidential spokesman noted that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, the ruling APC is one of those that stand to benefit from a legislation that favours wealthier parties.\n\n\u201cBut it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy.\n\n\u201cTo those that would rather that limited public funds be spent on politicking during this time of global crisis, we say: cease these cynical games.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTell the Nigerian people openly what you want. Put your \u2013 or rather their \u2013 money where your mouth is,\u201d he added.",

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 73 cents, or 1 per cent to $76.30, after rising to $76.92.\n\nBoth contracts reportedly traded at their highest in a month.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSupport comes as well from high aggregated production disruptions in Ecuador, Libya and Nigeria and the expectation of another large drop in U.S. crude inventories,\u201d said UBS oil analyst, Giovanni Staunovo.\n\nLEADERSHIP reported that about 200,000 barrels of crude oil is currently stranded as oil major Shell Plc halted crude shipments from Nigeria\u2019s Forcados export terminal.\n\nThe action is considered another blow to Nigeria which has struggled to stem falling production.\n\nShell Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria Ltd issued a notice of force majeure on Forcados shipments, effective from midday on December 21, and plans to issue a revised offtake program in due course.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMore than 200,000 barrels a day of Nigerian crude normally pass through the terminal.\n\nThe shutdown comes just a month after Shell said it was restoring flows from the nearby Bonny facility. Force majeure is a clause that allows companies to skip contractual obligations following issues outside of their control.\n\nThe stoppage occurred during replacement of one of the two single point moorings at Forcados, with the positioning of a jack-up barge preventing tanker access, export operations and resumption of full production into the terminal, Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said in a notice.\n\nThe presence of the jack-up offshore support vessel Seacor Strength at the Forcados moorings was confirmed by ship tracking data monitored by Bloomberg.\n\nNeither the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) nor Shell gave an indication of the likely duration of the stoppage. The force majeure suggests it will be long enough to affect four remaining cargoes that a port agent report seen by Bloomberg shows are due to be loaded this month.\n\nSince Shell announced the month-long force majeure at the Bonny site in October, only one ship has loaded a cargo from that terminal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresently, Nigeria, Libya and Ecuador have declared force majeures this month on part of their oil production because of maintenance issues and oilfield shutdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday that U.S. crude oil inventories are likely to have dropped for the fifth week in a row, while gasoline inventories were seen mostly unchanged last week.\n\nEngland will not face any new COVID-19 restrictions before the end of 2021, British health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday, as the government awaits more evidence on whether the health service can cope with high infection rates.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to ease a shortage of COVID-19 tests as the Omicron variant threatens to overwhelm hospitals and stifle travel plans.\n\nInvestors are awaiting an OPEC+ meeting on Jan. 4, at which the alliance will decide whether to go ahead with a planned production increase of 400,000 barrels per day in February.\n\nAt its last meeting, OPEC+ stuck to its plans to boost output for January despite Omicron.\n\nRussia is unlikely to hit its May target of pre-pandemic oil output levels due to a lack of spare production capacity but could do so later in the year, analysts and company sources said on Tuesday.\n\nMoney managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to December 21, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday.\n\nThe speculator group raised its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 4,634 contracts to 259,093 during the period.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s effort to meet its production quota recorded a 10 percentage points drop month on month to 239 per cent in November even as the country raised production slightly.\n\nOverall, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC)+ compliance with oil production cuts rose to 117 per cent in November from 116 per cent a month earlier, two sources from the group told Reuters, indicating production levels remain well below agreed targets.",

The force majeure suggests it will be long enough to affect four remaining cargoes that a port agent report seen by Bloomberg shows are due to be loaded this month.\n\nSince Shell announced the month-long force majeure at the Bonny site in October, only one ship has loaded a cargo from that terminal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresently, Nigeria, Libya and Ecuador have declared force majeures this month on part of their oil production because of maintenance issues and oilfield shutdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday that U.S. crude oil inventories are likely to have dropped for the fifth week in a row, while gasoline inventories were seen mostly unchanged last week.\n\nEngland will not face any new COVID-19 restrictions before the end of 2021, British health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday, as the government awaits more evidence on whether the health service can cope with high infection rates.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden pledged to ease a shortage of COVID-19 tests as the Omicron variant threatens to overwhelm hospitals and stifle travel plans.\n\nInvestors are awaiting an OPEC+ meeting on Jan. 4, at which the alliance will decide whether to go ahead with a planned production increase of 400,000 barrels per day in February.\n\nAt its last meeting, OPEC+ stuck to its plans to boost output for January despite Omicron.\n\nRussia is unlikely to hit its May target of pre-pandemic oil output levels due to a lack of spare production capacity but could do so later in the year, analysts and company sources said on Tuesday.\n\nMoney managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to December 21, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday.\n\nThe speculator group raised its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 4,634 contracts to 259,093 during the period.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s effort to meet its production quota recorded a 10 percentage points drop month on month to 239 per cent in November even as the country raised production slightly.\n\nOverall, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC)+ compliance with oil production cuts rose to 117 per cent in November from 116 per cent a month earlier, two sources from the group told Reuters, indicating production levels remain well below agreed targets.",

          "title": "Clark to Lai Mohammed: Jonathan flushed out Boko Haram from 14 Borno LGAs, not Buhari",
          "text": "FORMER Federal Commissioner for information and South-South leader, Chief Edwin Clark has taken a swipe at the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed for saying that if not for President Muhammadu Buhari, terrorists would have declared Nigeria as an Islamic state.\n\nClark who warned Lai Mohammed against garbing himself with propagandists toga as if he was still the National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, urged him to use his office to build bridges among Nigerians, adding that it is not true that President Buhari expelled Boko Haram of 14 Local Government Areas of Borno State.\n\nAccording to the Elder statesman, it was former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration that flushed out Boko Haram insurgents just before the 2015 general elections from the 14 local government areas they held in Borno state as against the claims by the Minister of information, adding that lies are being fabricated against the former President because he was President of Nigeria where some people think they alone have the exclusive right to be that position.\n\nIn a statement yesterday in Abuja, Clark who noted that it was Jonathan\u2019s administration\u2019s action that enabled elections to hold in the areas, said that the minister\u2019s recent statement was fallacious and misleading when he declared that \u201cNigeria would have been an Islamic state without President Mohammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cIt is a blatant falsehood for Alhaji Lai Mohammed to claim that but for President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would have been Islamised, that it was President Buhari government that sent Boko Haram out of the fourteen Local Government Areas in Borno State.\u201d\n\nThe Ijaw leader said that what gave Mohammed the impetus to make the statement is the fact that \u201cNigerians have not dispelled this fraudulent and false claim that it was President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government that expelled the Boko Haram group from the fourteen Local Government Areas of Borno State.\u201d\n\nClark who is the Leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) quoted excerpts from Jonathan\u2019s recent book where the former president narrated how the insurgents were flushed out saying: \u201cAnyhow, the six weeks served us well, we received the military equipment we were expecting within that period and our Armed Forces commendably, dealt a deserving blow on the terrorists and repossessed all territorial areas of Nigeria previously occupied by terrorists. Boko Haram was deflated up to the point of handing over to my successor on 29th May 2015. We concluded the elections peacefully, even if there were issues raised about the fairness, at least the nation was relieved that the election held peacefully and that there was no post-election violence.\u201d\n\nAccording to Clark, no patriotic Nigerian will believe Mohammed\u2019s statement that it was President Buhari that prevented the takeover of Nigeria by Islam, rather, \u201cmost Nigerians have the strong feeling that it is his government that has given or created the environment for the sect to return and be more daring. With all the menacing activities of this group, no armed herdsmen have been arrested. Is it by coincidence?\u201d\n\nHe said Mohammed therefore again, \u201cdecided to garb himself with the propagandist toga, which he used to wear as the Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), forgetting that he is today, the Information Minister of the country, a position which he should use to build bridges between the Federal Government and the people of Nigeria, and across all divides in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Ijaw nationalist recalled that while negotiations were being suggested with the insurgents, they chose then Major Gen. Buhari ad their chief negotiator.\n\nClark added: \u201cSetting the records straight: It is pertinent to reiterate that Boko Haram was expelled from the fourteen Local Government Areas of Borno State by former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government through the engagement of combined forces who were assisted by hired mercenaries.\n\n\u201cPrior to the period the sect was expelled, they were occupying fourteen Local Government Areas in the State. As a matter of fact, it was as a result of this that the elections could not be conducted at the initial scheduled date and had to be postponed.\n\n\u201cIt was this effrontery of making the state not to hold its functions that made the then government take the bull by the horn and flushed out the Boko Haram group out of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not true that it was President Mohammadu Buhari that expelled Boko Haram out of 14 Local Government Areas of Borno State.\n\n\u201cIt must be remembered that some Nigerians believed that the Boko Haram sect will be used to harass and torment President Goodluck Jonathan, getting him out of office.\n\n\u201cEven when it was suggested then that there should be a meeting to see the possibility of having negotiations between the Nigerian state and Boko Haram, the sect chose Gen. Mohammadu Buhari, rtd, as he then was, as their Chief Negotiator, even though a few days after the choice, he (Gen. Buhari), rejected the sect\u2019s choice of him.\n\n\u201cThere were no accusations the APC did not level against President Jonathan then, including criticising him for killing innocent Northerners through the sponsor of Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile all these were fabricated lies from the pit of hell, against an innocent man whose only offence is that he as the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Force of a country, where some people think they alone have the exclusive right to be in that position,\u201d\n\nRecalling the exchange he had with three former northeast governors including Admiral Murtala Nyako of Adamawa State, Kashim Shetima of Borno State and Ibrahim Geidam of Yobe State, on their accusations of Jonathan as the promoter of Boko Haram to kill northerners, he said it was a case of giving a dog a bad name in order to hang it.\n\nClark also recounted some of the statements made by Mohammed against Jonathan after the abduction of Chibok schoolgirls by Boko Haram including accusing his government of being behind the insurgents and Jonathan trying to gain political capital from the release of the school girls.\n\nChief Clark argued: \u201cOn the contrary, one can even adduce that it is Alhaji Lai Mohammed and his co-travellers on this voyage of destroying an innocent President Jonathan, that should be the prime suspects.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the attitude of both the then Borno State Governor, Kashim Shetima of not heeding to the advice of security experts and the Federal Ministry of Education which strongly objected, to relocate the Chibok schoolgirls to another school to write their West African Senior School Certificate (WASSCE) examinations based on security reasons, was bluntly rejected by the Governor, who rather stated that he would provide adequate security for the students, but which of course he deliberately he did not do.\n\n\u201cAnother worrisome aspect about the abduction is how did the abductors get the army uniforms they wore, with which they deceived about 200 school girls that they had come to rescue them. It was reported that the girls thought that the abductors were genuine soldiers because of the uniform they wore. They took away the girls in vehicles, unchallenged.\u201d\n\nAccording to the elder statesman, the gang up against the former president started when former incumbent president Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua fell ill in the office with Jonah as his vice.\n\nClark stated: \u201cThe whole gang up against former President Goodluck Jonathan started when the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua took ill and eventually died on 9th May 2010. It was at this stage that some \u2018prominent\u2019 persons from the North have vowed to themselves that they will not want Dr Jonathan to return to power in 2011, and allegedly started orchestrating all manners of evil, including the fuelling of the activities of the monster called Boko Haram.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the upsurge in Boko Haram\u2019s activities especially their bombing campaign in the federal capital was the most trying time for the Jonathan administration, adding, \u201cDuring this period, the opposition, of which Alhaji Lai Mohammed was one of its arrowheads, as the spokesman, carried out all sorts of propaganda, name-calling, against a sitting President. They ensured that their false and malicious statements made headlines in the news; they had a field day with social media.\n\n\u201cHowever, today, anyone who tries to do 1/100 of what they did or said then, will be guilty of \u2018hate speech.\n\n\u201cPresident Goodluck Jonathan knew that people were out to get at him, in any way, by all means. He even openly stated that Boko Haram had infiltrated his government.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, however, those who never wanted him in office and those who never liked him were basking in joy because their handiwork was succeeding. And actually, nurtured the group to be more daring in any way possible including people who made statements that fanned the embers of their activities, like Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\n\u201cBut like the saying goes what goes around, comes around, they never knew they were raising what is like the proverbial Frankenstein monster. What they created became uncontrollable and returns to haunt them.\n\n\u201cToday, part of Niger State in the North-Central geopolitical zone is occupied by Boko Haram. The Governor of the State, Dr Abubakar Sani Bello, has cried out several times about this. The insurgents have hoisted their flags in parts of the State, collecting levies and taxes from farmers before the latter will not only be allowed to go about their business but also enable them to live in peace.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, on 19th December 40 innocent persons were gruesomely murdered in Kaduna State by terrorists, in a state that has very major state security installations. These are not imaginary persons; they are sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, relatives of persons. In fact, the names of 29 of them were published, the rest were yet to be identified.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, there were rocket explosions at different locations when the President visited Maiduguri. Yet, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Information Minister, is not seeing this; what he keeps seeing in his imagination is his warped images of 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is a blatant falsehood for Alhaji Lai Mohammed to claim that but for President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would have been Islamised, that it was President Buhari government that sent Boko Haram out of the fourteen Local Government Areas in Borno State.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Southern Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) who admonished President Buhari over the utterances of his spokesmen who he stated are the president\u2019s albatross, said, \u201cI want to reiterate that the spokesmen of President Mohammadu Buhari, are his albatross. Their unwarranted attacks, insults, arrogance on opponents, behaving like Paul Joseph Goebbels, the chief propagandist of the Nazi Party of Germany, and one of the closest allies and spokesmen of Adolf Hitler during World War 2.\n\nAs Information Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed should be building bridges, instead of widening and expanding the gulf.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

And not just Imo, but the entire nation and humanity. Imo State is becoming a banana republic, where there is complete lawlessness and where people live in fear. There is no day that somebody is not being killed, harassed.\n\n\u201cIt appears as if the happenings in Imo state have some backing from Abuja. That\u2019s what I could figure out. And there seems to be enmity between the people here and the presumed federal government of Nigeria just because of a communication gap.\n\n\u201cMost people have been wondering about the mystery of unknown gunmen. But it appears to me now that unknown gunmen have finally been unraveled with the recent happenings.\n\n\u201cUnknown gunmen now is a set of policemen from Government House who, without the consent of the Commissioner of Police, the Inspector General of Police, or the DIGs, but on their own on the instruction of the government of Imo State, led by Hope Uzodimma, and his CSO, Shaba, who give directives to arrest people at will and lock up people at will and sometimes the whereabouts of these people are unknown.\n\n\u201cThey get policemen from the Government House and go to execute unholy acts. And when they run into problems, they quickly say it is the police.\u201d\n\nThe Imo State Government said Mr. Nwosu\u2019s arrest was part of an independent police investigation and that Mr. Okorocha was attempting to politicise the issue.\n\nMr. Nwosu, who has since been released by the police, said his arrest was politically motivated.\n\nHe said his release was ordered by the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba.",

          "text": "The Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) and Assembly of Healthcare Professional Associations (AHPA) have said they would not guarantee industrial peace in the sector if Consolidated Health Salary Structure (CONHESS) is not adjusted in the 2022 Budget before passage.\n\nThe health workers said any attempt to do otherwise would be met with stiff resistance.\n\nJOHESU National Chairman Biobelemoye Josiah issued the threat Monday while speaking on Kakaaki, a breakfast programme on African Independent Television.\n\nHe said the unions would not guarantee industrial harmony in the health sector if the president fails to include the adjusted salary structure.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting that Mr President will do us well because as a union we have yielded to his request that we should keep the health sector strike-free for the period. We have done our part; we expect that no matter the games that the Federal Ministry of Health is playing by trying to deny us our own right, the president has the power to direct that the committee\u2019s job should be included in the budget before he signs it.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to call on Nigerians to plead on our behalf because we have been very patient, we have been very patriotic and we will not want a situation where all the efforts we have put to ensure that there is peace in the health sector to waste because if it is not put into the budget, next year \u2013 a few days from now, which when we go into next year, certainly, the health sector will not be as peaceful as we have tried to keep it.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t put the adjusted CONHESS into the budget, then they should be ready for us,\u201d the JOHESU chairman said.\n\nJosiah said the unions were aware of a provision of N80 billion set aside to take care of the salary adjustment for health workers.\n\nHe said it would be wrong for the Federal Ministry of Health to \u201cdivert\u201d the funds for other purposes.\n\nThe union leader said: \u201cAt the peak of our agitation, the office of the chief of staff to the president also intervened. We are aware that there was a provision of N80 billion made to take care of adjustment of salaries. It is our strong belief that even if they have not specifically stated that this amount is for CONHESS adjustment, I think there is a provision made already.\n\n\u201cOur money from what the committee has worked out is not beyond that N80 billion. So, for the president who appealed to us and who we have also listened to, we have kept our deal; we have kept our gunpowder dry, we have not shot anyone, so the president should do us that favour by giving us that level of love that we have shown.\n\n\u201cWe believe that there is provision already imputed in the budget but the federal ministry of health in its well \u2013 celebrated bias would want to say the money is not meant for us so that they can favour those who they want to favour.\u201d\n\nOn the adjustments made to the hazard allowance, Josiah said the unions had accepted the explanation offered by the federal government.\n\nHe, however, warned that any attempt to favour one union against the other would be resisted.\n\nSpeaking on the hazard allowance, he said: \u201cAs for the approval of the hazard allowance, it is not where we wanted to be, but as far as we are concerned, government pleaded that that is what they can afford for now. In as much as we would have loved it to be higher than what we asked for, we have decided to give peace a chance and see how it is implemented.\n\n\u201cGovernment has issued a circular and we will abide by it for now. But where the government listens to any agitation and increases by one kobo, that must be given to us too. Where government wishes to take our high level of understanding for granted, we will certainly tell them it is not weakness.\u201d\n\nHe also called for a balance in the leadership of the Health Ministry, saying this would benefit the country.\n\nJosiah added: \u201cIf any government wants a proper health system, a developed health system in this country we should change from this leadership where they put medical doctors at the helm of affairs. Let us go back to what took us to be among the best in the commonwealth. Hospitals\u2019 administrators should take charge so that there will be fairness and neutrality in handling hospital affairs for all professional groups.\n\n\u201cToday, a matter that ought to have been handled by the HR in the Federal Ministry of Health, it is the Directorate of Hospital Services that is handling it and that is headed by medical doctors. That is why there is huge bias being displayed every now and then and that is why since 1985, the health system has dropped from its high point down to where we are and if we must talk about international best practices then we must rejig the leadership.\n\n\u201cRight from the beginning of this administration, we asked that the three top personnel should not come from one profession. The minister and minister of state should not come from one profession and the permanent secretary. For now that has not been heeded and the country is suffering for that.\n\n\u201cI want to ask again; if the president is hearing me, that he should rejig and any other government that is coming should take this free advice and make the health system work for the masses of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, Garba Shehu, has given further insight into the President\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mr Shehu said the move is part of efforts to protect the democracy of the nation and the President will do whatever he can to protect it.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, the ruling APC is one of those that stands to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties. But it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nRELATED:\n\n[Electoral Bill] Buhari\u2019s Decision Not The End, Says Adesina\n\nBuhari To Sign 2022 Budget On Friday\n\nPresident Buhari had last Tuesday declined assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill over the direct primaries clause.\n\nIn a letter sent to the National Assembly, the President cited several issues with the clause, including legal, economic security challenges.\n\nHe added that it would also impact negatively on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\nAnother of his aides, Mr Femi Adesina had reiterated the concerns of the President, stating that he had sourced the opinions of several stakeholders before arriving at the decision.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s strength as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa with one of its highest standards of living owes above all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\n\u201cIt is this act which the new bill seeks to amend. These amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon our democratic processes. After careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true,\u201d Mr Shehu reiterated in his statement on Tuesday.\n\nRead his full statement below.\n\nIn Amending The Electoral Act, The Nation First, Always First For Mr. President\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to withhold assent from the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has come under scrutiny from media and political circles.\n\nThis is quite correct because it is a decision that will impact all Nigerians. The President\u2019s Office has decided, therefore, to issue an official statement to make its position clear.\n\nNigeria\u2019s strength as a nation and its status as one of the wealthiest economies in Africa with one of its highest standards of living owes above all to its proud democratic processes, which are enshrined in the Electoral Act of 2010.\n\nIt is this act which the new bill seeks to amend. These amendments have been presented as a means to enhance and build upon our democratic processes. After careful review, the President\u2019s Office has found that the opposite is true.\n\nRather, the proposed amendments entail significant legal, financial, economic and security consequences for all Nigerians, principal among which would be a severe spike in the cost of holding primary elections by parties \u2013 integral to democracies the world over.\n\nAnd who would shoulder these costs? The Nigerian taxpayer of course, and who would benefit? Only the richest of political parties. At a time when the nation is seeking to extricate itself from the economic mire of the worst global health crisis in living memory, whatever other merits the new bill may have, now is not the time for such frivolous spending of public money.\n\nInevitably, the usual voices are making themselves heard, with cynical claims of election rigging and so on. This is nothing new. We heard their self-serving cries of fraud in 2015, when we saw the first peaceful transfer of power in independent Nigeria\u2019s history. Then again in 2019, when President Buhari was re-elected with a lead of over three million. We will hear them again in 2023.\n\nUntil then, the President will do whatever he can to protect this county\u2019s democracy, and that includes withholding assent from this Bill. It is worth noting that, as one of Nigeria\u2019s largest political parties, the ruling APC is one of those that stand to benefit from a bill that favours wealthier parties. But it is not the job of this government to protect the APC. It is the job of this government to protect Nigeria, her people and her democracy.\n\nTo those that would rather that limited public funds be spent on politicking during this time of global crisis, we say: cease these cynical games. Tell the Nigerian people openly what you want. Put your \u2013 or rather their \u2013 money where your mouth is.",
