          "text": "The group, No Alternative to Buhari and Osinbajo 2019, have condemned the anti-open grazing law governors from the 17 southern states plan to enact in their jurisdictions.\n\nThis was contained in a statement in Abuja signed by its National Coordinator, Vincent Uba, describing the ban as an unfair criminality label on legitimate businessmen, stating that the herdsmen targeted in the law were not known to carry arms.\n\nThe statement also said that reports linking herdsmen to criminality were unsubstantiated.\n\nHe said, \u201cGranted that there could be some bad eggs or criminals within herders who perpetrate these crimes, it is pertinent to note that criminal tendencies equally obtain in other professions or occupations.\n\n\u201cIt would, therefore, be unfair to label the entire herdsmen as criminals. This is in no way an attempt to condone criminality.\u201d\n\nUba urged the governors to reconsider their position and not add more fire to the flame that is already causing a crisis in the country. He added the governors should also consider that the herders are mostly illiterate and would education on the reasons why open grazing should be done away with.\n\n\u201cTo the southern governors and others who have banned open grazing, we urge you to tread softly. Banning a system that is as old as Nigeria itself is bound to produce rebound effects. This will definitely breed more crises and insecurity than is desired to be avoided.\n\n\u201cLegislating against open grazing without first providing alternative means of herding is likely to fuel more crises and heat up the polity.\n\n\u201cThe much talked about ranching is no doubt the way to go, with due consideration taken that the vast number of these people who engage in nomadic herding are illiterates. Educating them on the need for a new approach to their way of doing business is key,\u201d Uba added.",

          "text": "By Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Monday, ordered the immediate release of the international passport of a former Governor of Rivers State, Dr. Peter Odili, which was seized by the Nigeria Immigration Service, NIS.The court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo, held that there was no legal justification for the action the NIS took against the former governor.\n\nOdili, who piloted affairs of Rivers State from 1999 to 2007, had approached the court to challenge the seizure of his international passport by the NIS.\n\nHe told the court that his passport with numbers B50031305, was seized from him on June 20 by NIS officials for undisclosed reason, shortly after he landed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.\n\nHe said the NIS had since refused to release the passport to him.\n\nIn an 8-paragraphed affidavit he personally deposed to, the former governor, said he landed at the airport from the United Kingdom where he had gone for his routine medical checkup.\n\nHe averred that upon his arrival, his traveling documents were checked and given back to him, but while he waited for his luggage to be cleared, an Immigration official approached him and demanded for the passport on claim of routing check.\n\nOdili told the court that he complied and handed his documents over to the official who went away with and failed to return it back.\n\nStressing that he is a law abiding senior citizen of Nigeria that did not do anything to warrant the seizure of his passport, Odili, prayed the court to intervene in the matter.\n\nHe prayed the court to compel the two Respondents in the matter to release the passport to him, as well as to issue an order of perpetual injunction stopping them from further harassing, embarrassing, intimidating or interfering with his fundamental right to freedom of movement.\n\nHe equally prayed the court to compel the Respondents to tender written apology to him for the embarrassment caused him by the Immigration.\n\nCited as Respondents in the matter were the NIS and its Comptroller General.\n\nThe NIS had in processes it filed before the court, maintained that its action was based on a directive from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, which it said had placed the erstwhile governor on its watchlist.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Other states where APC had parallel congresses are Enugu, Ogun, Osun, Bauchi, Kano, Kwara and Niger.\n\nIn the PDP, crisis over sharing of National Working Committee, NWC, positions zoned to the South-West worsened, with some PDP leaders being at daggers drawn with Oyo State governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde.\n\nAlso, leaders of the party in the South-East opposed alleged imposition of Senator Sam Anyanwu as national secretaryship candidate.\n\nIndeed, the PDP in Oyo is factionalised and the party had parallel state congresses, on Saturday with hoodlums disrupting the congress of one of the factions in Ibadan. National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party hierarchy would take measures to resolve the crises so that the party will go to the national convention in 11 days time with a united front.\n\nIn like manner, a top leader of the APC said the party has laid down measures for resolving issues arising from the parallel congresses. One of the measures is to sanction those who went out of line to stage a parallel congress without exhausting internal mechanism for resolving grievances.\n\nAccording to the National Committee Chairman for Osun State APC congress, Gbenga Elegbeleye, any congress not supervised by the team from the national headquarters is a mere jamboree. He spoke as the newly elected Abia State Chairman of the APC, Mazi Enyinnaya Habour, extended a hand of fellowship to all aggrieved members of the party to reposition the APC for the 2023 polls in Abia.\n\nConfusion as APC gets three state excos in Akwa Ibom\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, an end to the supremacy battle rocking the APC appears far from sight as the party conducted three separate state congresses and elected three state executives to steer the ship of the party in the state.\n\nThe faction loyal to Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio held its state congress at the Kara Event Centre, along stadium road,Uyo where Mr. Steve Ntukekpo emerged as state chairman.\n\nIt was gathered that Mr. Victor Antai, a former Commissioner for Culture and Tourism before he moved to the APC ahead of 2019 general elections stepped down for Ntukekpo.\n\nOn another hand, Mr. Douglas Pepple was also elected as state chairman by another group loyal to the Senior Special Assistant to the president on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang.\n\nThe list of 36 elected state officials obtained by Vanguard, yesterday, in Uyo, was signed by Group Capt. Sam Ewang, retd; Senator Ita Enang and Dr Maurice Ebong for Akwa Ibom APC leaders.\n\nHowever, a statement by Dr. Ita Udosen, state caretaker committee chairman, and a group loyal to Senator John Akpanudoedehe showed that Mr. Augustine Ekanem was elected state chairman, thereby bringing to three the number of state executives elected in the state.\n\nThe state entitled: \u201cResults of APC state congress Elections\u201d read in part: \u201cIn line with the Constitution of All Progressives Congress, I wish to bring to the notice of all APC members and the general public, the official results of state congress Elections conducted through open secret balloting on Saturday, October16, 2021, at Sheergrace Arena, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State as announced by the 7-man State Congress Committee from Abuja who conducted the exercise.\n\n\u2018The Congress was attended by the party chieftains; Atuekong Don Etiebet, HE Godswill Akpabio, HE Group Captain Sam Ewang, Mr. Umana Okon Umana, Senator Ita Enang, Sir Bassey Dan-Abia, Dr. Ita Udosen, Archbishop Sam Rt. Hon. Emman Ekon, Rt. Hon. Emman Akpan, Otuekon Sunny Jackson Udoh, DIG Udom Ekpoudom, Chief Godwin Afangide, Chief Engr. Benedict Ukpong, Dr. Bassey Antai, Dr. Edet Atti, Rt. Hon Nse Ntuen, Barr. Ibanga Akpabio, Hon. Engr. Akanimo Edet\n\namong other important party dignitaries that graced the occasion and cast their votes.\n\n\u201cThe attendance cuts across all the major shades of opinion in our party and there was no one left in doubt as regard the authenticity of the Congress which was very peaceful\u2026The party therefore warns that members who attempt to circulate forged list of party organs and those found impersonating to confuse the public will find it hot in the hands of security agents this time. The party directs all members to accord the newly elected state officers the due respect.\u201d\n\nIt was observed that officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and APC congress committee from Abuja, led by Sheriff Banky monitored the congress held by the Senator Akpanudoedehe\u2019s faction.\n\nHowever, while addressing the congress at Kara Event Centre, Senator Akpabio promised to work towards ensuring unity among the leaders in the state in order to position the party to take over power in 2023.\n\nHis words: \u201cI want you to note today, do not look at the disagreement of the elders, because every war whether first world war or second world war was settled at the round table. And many of you will not be there when the war will be settled. But one thing is sure, I brought the message of peace.\n\n\u201cNow you are wrestling power from a sitting government, don\u2019t take it for granted, it\u2019s not a tea party. No single group can do it alone, we must do it together. But one thing we can resolve is, never again shall we be in opposition in 2023 and we should be wise in electing who will lead us.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Senator Ita Enang assured the party members that the different congresses are working for the interest of the party, stressing, \u201cI have seen other congresses going on, all are working for the APC. People must always disagree to agree but the most important thing is that we are all working for the party.\u201d\n\nSome party members in the state have described the development in the party as worrisome and confusing.\n\nAny congress not conducted by APC national officials\u2019s jamboree\u2014 Elegbeleye\n\nMeanwhile, the National Committee Chairman for the congress in Osun State congress, Mr. Gbenga Elegbeleye, said any congress apart from the ones approved the national headquarters has described is a mere jamboree.\n\nThe faction of APC in Osun, loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, had organised a congress at Ladsol area, Ogo-Oluwa, while the National Committee conducted the APC congress held at the Osogbo city stadium, where Prince Gboyega Famodun and Mr Kamoru Adebisi emerged as chairman and secretary respectively.\n\nMr Rasaq Salinsile and Mr Adelani Baderinwa emerged as chairman and secretary at the factional congress.\n\nAddressing journalists at the APC secretariat, yesterday, Elegbeleye said his committee was not in the state for political jamboree but to supervise and conduct congress for the APC at a specified venue, which is the stadium in the state capital, adding that neither a faction nor the National Secretariat notified the committee of any other congress.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of any congress elsewhere in Osun State, nobody notified me or any member of this committee. We are seven in number. What we don\u2019t know we don\u2019t act on it.\n\n\u201cWe came to the state secretariat of the party on Friday to hold a stakeholders\u2019 meeting and we informed all party members that the congress we were saddled to conduct by the National Secretariat, will be held at Osogbo city Stadium on Saturday. We came here to announce the venue of the congress. So if anybody goes to any shrine to do anything, certainly that maybe funeral ceremony or marriage ceremony but not a congress\u201d, he said.\n\nCountering, Mr Adelani Baderinwa said Elegbeleye came to the state to do a dirty job, which he has concluded, but would not deny that form was sold to the group.\n\n\u201cHe came to do a dirty job here and he has completed it. There is no reasonable committee chairman that would be aware that the national secretariat sold two sets of forms and he would be saying he was not aware of our congress,\u201d Baderinwa added.\n\nHarbour, Abia APC chairman extends olive branch to aggrieved members\n\nTHE newly elected Abia State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Mazi Enyinnaya Habour, has extended a hand of fellowship to all aggrieved members of the party to reposition the APC for the 2023 polls.\n\nThanking party members for his election, Harbor said his victory has put the party on the path of going to the Government House, adding with him on the seat the party was sure of capturing the state in 2023.\n\nPledging to rebuild the APC in the state, he appealed to aggrieved members, adding that the doors of the party are open for genuine members.\n\nLoyalists of the Hon. Donatus Nwankpa gathered at the indoor Sports Hall of the Umuahia township stadium, for a parallel congress.\n\nHabor was elected at the state congress held in Umuahia, the state capital, on Saturday.\n\nThe congress was conducted by the Seven-man committee from the national headquarters led by Hon. Babatunde Kolawole and Hon. Muktar Bajeh, chief whip of the Kogi State House of Assembly. Harbour, Chidi Avaja, Obinna Atuonwu were elected chairman, secretary, and organizing secretary respectively. Other officers were elected by consensus.\n\nHe belongs to the Ikechi Emenike group, whose congress was monitored by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, was attended by eminent members of the party from the 17 council areas in the state including the Member representing Isuikwuato/Umunneochi Federal constituency, Hon. Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; former Governorship aspirant, Sir Friday Nwosu; ex organizing secretary of the Nwankpa faction, Chief Obi Aham; and the Member representing Isuikwuato constituency in the state House of Assembly, and Emeka Okoroafor among others.\n\nDon\u2019t bring the party down because of your selfish interest, APC warns\n\nDisturbed by the developments, the APC has warned aggrieved members who conducted parallel state congresses at the weekend against bringing the party down due to their selfish interests, saying they should instead exhaust the option of appeal.\n\nNational Secretary of the party\u2019s Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe gave the warning while reacting to the outcome of the exercises.\n\nAccording to him, the party leadership will not recognize such parallel congresses.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe successfully concluded the first and second congresses in the Wards and Local Governments by observing all the laid down rules and regulations, including satisfying the requirements of the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore want to sound a note of warning again that any congress outside what we have endorsed is an effort in futility. All we want to appeal to them is to respect the constituted authority by exploring the Appeal Committee option when we set it up. Again, we have a listening chairman who can attend to any kind of complaint from anybody.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to bring the party down because of their selfish interests. It is not done that way. In any case, we don\u2019t want to overrate ourselves, otherwise I will say that we achieved 99 per cent successes in the three congresses we have conducted so far,\u201d he declared.\n\nAkpanudoedehe in another statement, while congratulating APC\u2019s teeming members on the successful conduct of its State Congresses across the country, said: \u201cHowever, our attention has been drawn to reports of so called and purported \u2018parallel\u2019 congresses. To borrow the phrase of one of our esteemed governors, such \u201cparallel\u201d congresses are mere naming ceremonies. The purported \u2018parallel\u2019 congresses are futile activities and very strange to the party, our Constitution and the guidelines for the conduct of the State and other congresses.\n\n\u201cOnly exercises conducted by duly inaugurated State Congress Committees are recognised by the Party. The APC leadership will not hesitate to take adequate and lawful measures against any person or interest sabotaging the collective Party\u2019s interest and efforts to achieve peace and unity in our great party.\n\n\u201cWhere contestations exist, adequate conflict resolution measures have been put in place to address them. The party has Appeal committees for every Congress.\n\n\u201cRecall also that the Party has inaugurated the National Reconciliation Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Abdullahi Adamu, former Governor of Nasarawa state to reconcile all differences among stakeholders and party members,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSouth-West PDP crisis deepens\n\nIn the PDP, moves by the Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to distribute National Working Committee, NWC, offices micro-zoned to the South-West among his allies, is causing unrest in the zonal chapter of the PDP ahead of the October 31 national convention, a national officer of the party Sunday, confided in Vanguard.\n\nAccording to him, the Offices of the Deputy National Chairman (South), Deputy National Secretary and National Publicity Secretary were micro-zoned to the South-West following the recommendation by the Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led zoning committee and subsequent ratification of same by the National Executive Committee, NEC for swapping of party offices between the North and South.\n\nThe party official said Governor Makinde\u2019s lack of consultation may do the South-West more harm than good if \u201coutstanding issues are not resolved,\u201d in the interest of all parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe crisis in the South-West PDP is not being managed well by Governor Seyi Makinde. He is the creator of the problem. He wants to fix the three positions zoned to the South-West among members of his political camp. He did not consult with the leaders of the zone and that was the beginning of the problem.\n\n\u201cHe wants to single-handedly share those three NWC offices without consulting leaders like Ayo Fayose, Ladi Adebutu, Ademola Adeleke and Adedeji Doherty, among others.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhen he (Makinde) met with our leaders following the intervention of Fayose, he was told clearly to allow the states that make up the South-West to bring their nominations. He told them that he had already picked Oyinlola to be Deputy National Chairman but the people of Osun rejected it.\n\nMeanwhile, Diran Odeyemi, deputy national publicity secretary of the PDP has called on the leadership of the party in the zone to put its house in order ahead of the convention.\n\n\u201cIt will be a shame on the leadership of the South-West where we have had leaders of the party to allow this crisis unresolved before the national convention. It will not portray us as a zone with leaders and elders who are capable of resolving issues.\n\nPDP Scribe: Obi, Udenwa, Ihedioha kick against imposition of Anyanwu as S/E candidate\n\nLeaders of the PDP in the South-East have rejected what they called the imposition of Senator Sam Anyanwu as the consensus candidate for the position of national secretary of the party from the zone.\n\nThe chieftains including ex- governors of Anambra and Imo states, Mr Peter Obi and Chief Achike Udenwa as well as Emeka Ihedioha, among others, pointed out that what happened at the PDP meeting held on October 14, in Enugu and hosted by Governor Ugwuanyi can best be described as a stalemate.\n\nNo decision at the meeting, they insisted was taken to pick Senator Anyanwu to represent the South-East as PDP national secretary.\n\nAccording to them, Governors Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and Okezie Ikpeazu of Enugu and Abia states merely came to the meeting and announced the selection of Senator Anyanwu. Most of the people who attended the meeting, according to the PDP chieftains, vehemently objected to it and refused to accept it.\n\nThe PDP chieftains, according to a statement by Chief Madu Chinemerem, a former official of the PDP from Imo State, said: \u201cWhat transpired at the PDP meeting held on Thursday 14th October at Enugu hosted by Governor Ugwuanyi can best be described as a stalemate. The meeting certainly didn\u2019t elect Sam Anyanwu to represent the South-East as PDP national secretary.\n\n\u201cGov Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu came to the meeting and just announced the selection of Senator Anyanwu. Most of the people who attended vehemently objected to it and refused to accept it. The entire Anambra delegation led by Peter Obi rejected it. Imo delegates led by former Govs Emeka Ihedioha and Achike Udenwa also rejected it.\n\n\u201cThe state chairmen of some of the state chapters also said no. The meeting ended without any agreement.\n\n\u201cWhat was most annoying to South-East leaders was that Sen Sam Anyanwu is being imposed on them by a Governor from South-South who nominated him.\n\n\u201cDefinitely Anambra and Imo States have better materials for the office if it is zoned to them,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWe\u2019ll resolve issues arising from state congresses before natl convention\u2014 PDP spokesman\n\nSpeaking on the problems, Spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, assured party faithful that crises arising from Saturday\u2019s state congresses will be resolved before the October 31 national convention of the party.\n\nIt would be recalled that the congresses recorded varying degree of successes across the country. While Plateau and Ebonyi state chapters both conducted peaceful and successful congresses, the story was different in Osun as two factions held parallel congresses.\n\nIn Lagos state, the exercise was cancelled amid allegations of shady deals. All these have led to fears of possible tension in affected state chapters ahead of the convention.\n\nMr. Ologbondiyan said the party has already initiated moves to put things right before the convention.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt is true that some issues arose from the congresses we conducted yesterday (Saturday) but I can assure our teeming members and well meaning Nigerians that we will do all it takes to resolve these issues.\n\n\u201cPDP is different from other political parties because we are first and foremost, members of one political family. Already, the leadership of the party is looking at the issues and we have initiated steps to address all of them.\n\n\u201cWe are coming to the convention as one united body desirous of putting in place structures that will assist us in ousting the All Progressives Congress, APC, from power come 2023.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "State congresses of the APC, weekend, threw up more challenges as no fewer than nine states held parallel congresses with some, such as Lagos and Akwa Ibom, producing three parallel state executive committees.\nAccording to the National Committee Chairman for Osun State APC congress, Gbenga Elegbeleye, any congress not supervised by the team from the national headquarters is a mere jamboree.\nNo decision at the meeting, they insisted was taken to pick Senator Anyanwu to represent the South-East as PDP national secretary.\nThe meeting certainly didn\u2019t elect Sam Anyanwu to represent the South-East as PDP national secretary.\nWe\u2019ll resolve issues arising from state congresses before natl convention\u2014 PDP spokesmanSpeaking on the problems, Spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, assured party faithful that crises arising from Saturday\u2019s state congresses will be resolved before the October 31 national convention of the party.",

          "text": "A panel of United States policymakers has uncovered how Boko Haram terrorists operating in the North-East have been collaborating with armed bandits terrorising communities across the North-West to collect ransom from the Buhari administration and civilian victims, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe American newspaper reports that the U.S. has not recognised armed banditry as a direct threat to its interest, but officials have been monitoring bandit commanders and their possible coordination with Boko Haram insurgents.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are a distant priority for U.S. policy makers focused on Nigeria\u2019s jihadist threat, though American officials say they have intercepted calls from suspected Islamist militants in the northeast who are advising bandits in the northwest on kidnapping operations and negotiations,\u201d the Journal said in a report published on Saturday.\n\nThe report could bolster widespread calls for President Muhammadu Buhari to declare the bandits as terrorists, even though they have no declared political or religious aim.\n\nAdministration officials said the government was not in a hurry to label the bandits, but has ordered security forces to intensify raids of unsecured forests and other hideouts.\n\n\u201dThe problem is to understand the culture of the cattle rearers, the Nigerian cattle rearers do not carry anything more than a stick. Sometimes they carry machetes to just cut some herbs for the cattle, but those foreigners from other parts of Africa are carrying AK-47,\u201d Mr Buhari had said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nBut the bandits have acquired weapons far more assorted than AK-47, and they have recently shot down a fighter jet deployed to conduct reconnaissance operations in the hostile region.\n\n\u201cCriminal factions appear to be better equipped with larger-capacity advanced weaponry than national security agencies,\u201d the Journal reported, citing a security memo presented to Buhari in July.\n\nREAD ALSO: UK advises citizens against travelling to 12 Nigerian states\n\nThe Journal disclosed the U.S. findings as the outlet was reporting that the Nigerian Air Force paid N20 million in ransom to buy back an anti-aircraft machine gun from bandits before they could use the machine to bring down the president\u2019s plane.\n\nPeoples Gazette could not immediately confirm that the U.S. has shared its intelligence around Boko Haram-bandits collaboration with Buhari or his national security appointees.\n\nAlthough the Nigerian military has launched frequent attacks to take out bandits across the North-West, the gangs have shown stronger capabilities and resilience in confronting government forces over the past year.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force confirmed on July 19 that bandits had shot down one of its fighter jets, but the pilot was able to eject without and there were no casualties. The incident came as Mr Buhari was visiting his hometown for this year\u2019s Sallah.\n\nIn August, the bandits breached the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna, killing soldiers and abducting other officers, including an army major. At least three military bases have also been raided in Sokoto and Zamfara within the past few weeks.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Some residents of the South East Zone of the country have vowed to resort to firewood and charcoal if prices of cooking gas continue to soar.\n\nThe consumers told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in separate interviews that they could no longer cope with the situation as it was taking a toll on their lives.\n\nThey called on the Federal Government to address the current hike in the price of cooking gas to ease the sufferings on the people.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNAN check in some gas plants in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo States showed that the price of cooking gas had increased by more than 50 per cent.\n\nNAN reports that a 12.5kg cylinder which was sold for N6,800 in September, had increased to between N7,800 and N8,000 depending on locations.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was also observed that a 6kg cylinder, that previously sold for N2,900, had gone up to N4200 in less than a month.\n\nA manager of one of the gas plants in Awka, who pleaded anonymity told NAN that the hike was as a result of the current devaluation of the naira.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cYou know gas is refined and imported into the country, therefore, the price is dominated by the dollar. So, the more the naira is devalued, the higher the prices will continue to rise,\u201d he said.\n\nSome consumers, who spoke to NAN separately, blamed the government for its inability to control the price of cooking gas in the open market.\n\nA resident of a gas plant in Awka, who identified himself as Mr Smart Okongi, said that the continued rise in the price of cooking gas was alarming adding that the increase was being felt by many Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs a civil servant with no increment in salary, it is now becoming very difficult keeping up with the everyday rise in prices of food stuff, transportation, rent and now cooking gas.\n\n\u201cThis development is sad because our country is endowed with natural gas. I also blame the Federal government for its inability to control the price in the open market.\n\n\u201dI appeal to the government to reduce or have a fixed price for cooking gas to alleviate our sufferings,\u201d Okongi said.\n\nAnother resident, Mrs Helen Aniaso, a caterer, said that the daily rise in price of cooking gas was impacting on her business negatively.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating because for every time we go to refill, the price increases. It is affecting my business in terms of productivity and profit.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the prices of the food we sell just to meet up, but we are loosing customers because many of them cannot afford to pay.\n\n\u201cIt is not also cheaper resorting to kerosene, charcoal, or firewood because their prices too have increased.\n\n\u201cThe government should come to our aid before our sources of livelihood collapse, \u201d she said.\n\nMr Adolphus Egwu, a businessman in Onitsha, expressed fears that the price of 12.5kg gas cylinder might increase to N10,000 by December if the government did not act quickly.\n\n\u201cThis practice of gas sellers is highly unfair to users, considering the economic situation in the country. Because of this hike, a plate of food rose from about N400 or N500 to N800 or N1,000?\n\n\u201cI appeal to the relevant regulatory agencies, to halt this practice by monitoring and checking the excesses of the sellers,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a similar situation in all the states in the zone as consumers groan over the rising cost of cooking gas.\n\nSome gas dealers in the zone blamed the development to increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) to the petroleum products, high demand of gas and naira devaluation.\n\nAccording to an Umuahia resident in Abia, I now use charcoal as an alternative because a 7kg of gas that I used to refill with less than N2000 now goes for over N4,000, that is at the rate of N640 per kg.\n\nA financial expert, Mr Timothy Okoroafor, said the inflation rate posed a serious challenge and was largely responsible for increased spending on food items and cooking gas.\n\n\u201cWhat do you expect when we are only consuming and not producing as a nation?\n\n\u201cThe monetary and other fiscal policies of the government do not help matters.\n\n\u201cThere is also no price control.\n\n\u201cOur government should come up with some interventions and provide an enabling environment for industries to thrive,\u201d Okoroafor said.\n\nOn high cost of food items, Mr Jerry Okenwa, who sells food items at Isigate, said the prices of food would continue to soar because the local production could meet the ever increasing demand.\n\nAccording to him, the problem of insecurity in the country, which affected farming, coupled with the border closure, has contributed majorly to the high cost of food items.\n\nOkenwa said: \u201cThe farmers are afraid to go to farm because of fear of attacks, so the ones available are not enough for our large population.\n\n\u201cOur local production is not enough, while the border is not open for importation.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThe cost of transportation of the food items has also increased by 100 per cent.\n\n\u201cSince the cost of transporting the items from the north to this place (Abia) has increased, one has to sell according to how one buys, in order to cover cost and make some profit.\u201d\n\nSome market men and women in the zone, while expressing their grievances, attributed the high increase in the prices of foodstuffs to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOthers attributed the hike to increase in transport fares and the inability of farmers to produce enough food for domestic consumption as a result of insecurity in the country.\n\nSome of the major foodstuffs affected by the price hike, as confirmed by NAN, include rice, beans, tomato, pepper, palm oil, onions, egg, plantain, garri, spaghetti, yam, soup sauces such as Egusi, Ogbono and cocoyam.\n\nEven the prices of bread, table and satchet water, soft drinks and many other edibles have increased.\n\nMrs Joy Ekeh, a petty trader, said that the hike in food prices was alarming.\n\n\u201cTwo months ago, I bought a bottle of palm oil at the rate of N800 but today I just bought for N1,400, same goes for other commodities.\n\n\u201cIncrease in the prices of food items is getting worse by the day and that should not be. The government\u2019s agency in charge of price regulation should do something about this,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Agnes Madu, a business woman, noted that a tuber of yam that was sold for N700 to N800 had gone up to N1,200 to N1,300, adding that she could no longer afford to buy more than one.\n\n\u201cNot just yam, even the prices of beans and garri have all increased. A cup of Egusi as of August was N120 but now it is sold at the cost of N250 to N300.\n\n\u201cIf care is not taken, the poor will find it hard to feed if things continued at that rate, \u201d she said .\n\nOne Mr Angus Eleweke, a civil servant, called on the state and federal government to urgently address the situation before things get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe cannot blame the traders; there are a number of factors for food prices inflation.\n\nOne of them is the issue of security. Some of the areas where foods come from have been subjected to banditry and insecurity.\n\n\u201cFarmers out of fear for their lives have not been going to the farm. This contributes to the price increases we are witnessing.\n\n\u201cAs traders complain, so do buyers. The soaring prices of food stuffs are frustrating many families with limited budgets,\u201d Eleweke said.\n\nMrs Agnes Ebeke, a Customer described the rise in cooking gas and food prices as artificial inflation.\n\nEbeke added that average Nigerian family was finding it difficult to buy the product between N680 and N800 at its current price per kilogramme in some gas plants and outlets.\n\nShe said that the steady increase in the items were disturbing and could continue if not checked.\n\n\u201cGas outlets sell the product higher than the gas plants,\u201d Ebeke said.\n\nMr Chiwe Ogbonna, cooking gas user at Hariz Gas Plant limited, explained that price of LPG has been on steady rise since January 2021.\n\nOgbonna expressed concern that the commodity was getting beyond the reach of the average citizen.\n\nIn Ebonyi, residents appealed to relevant stakeholders to address the worsening economic down turn and reverse inflationary trend that caused hike in prices of essential commodities in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, an attendant at the Lopa gas station who spoke on condition of anonymity, alleged that gas price was not determined by the stations but according to price fixed by regulatory agencies.\n\nMrs Stella Onu and Nwamaka Ugwu Consumers while making their purchases, described the situation as unacceptable and called on relevant authorities to urgently take necessary step to reverse the price hike.\n\nMr Evans Chika, at the Margaret Umahi International Market said a bag of crayfish is sold between N75, 000 and N70, 000 as against N45, 000 and N50, 000 sold in September.\n\n\u201cA painter of crayfish is sold between N3, 000 and N3, 500 currently. The cost is getting higher gradually,\u201d they said.\n\nAnother Customer and civil servant, Mrs Amara Ezeoketa, lamented that buying food items at its current price with a salary of less than N50,000 a month was becoming difficult for her and other families as well.\n\nEzeoketa disclosed that a bag of onion now cost between N60, 000 and N55, 000 as against N18, 000 and N25, 00 in August 2021.\n\n\u201cNow a painter of beans is sold between N2, 400 and N2, 800 depending on the brand.\n\n\u201cA bottle of palm oil is now sold at N800, and a litre of groundnut oil sold between N1, 200 and N1, 500 depending on the brand.\n\n\u201cThe increase also affects other items like, floor, beverages, soft drinks, toiletries, tailoring materials among others,\u201d Ezeoketa said.

          "title": "APC congress widens cracks in state chapters",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja, Okey Sampson, Umuahia, Paul Orude Bauchi, Laide Raheem, Abeokuta, Lateef Dada, Osogbo, Rose Ejembi, Makurdi\n\nThe much-postponed state congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held last weekend has further polarised the ruling party as confusion, parallel leadership and multiple chairmen emerged in many states.\n\nTwo days after the exercise, bickering and rancour have persisted in Akwa Ibom, Kano, Bauchi, Kwara, Rivers, Niger, Osun, Delta and in almost all the South-East states as they have either two or more factional chairmen to contend with.\n\nIn Ogun State, faction loyal to Governor Dapo Abiodun has threatened to expel former governor, Senator Ibikunle Amonsun.\n\nSources from states rocked by crisis said while the situation during the congresses degenerated to shooting of guns, others though peaceful produced multiple leaderships.\n\nIn Abia, Enyi Harbor and Acho Obioma, emerged chairmen in parallel congresses. Harbor was returned as consensus chairman in the Chief Ikechi Emenike-led faction, while Chidi Abuaja emerged as state party secretary.\n\nObinna Atuonwu was announced as organising secretary and Okey Ezeala publicity secretary among others, who emerged from a consensus exercise held at Chidiebere Park Ugwunchara Umuahia opposite Holy Rosary Girls Secondary school.\n\nIn the other faction led by chairman, APC caretaker committee, Chief Donatus Nwamkpa, held at Umuahia Township stadium, Obioma polled 298 votes to defeat Sylvanus Nwaji who got one vote, Dike Nwankwo, four, Chidi Nwosu, 92 and Ikechukwu Ukaegbu 134 while there were 24 voided votes.\n\nIn Bauchi, opposing factions loyal to former speaker, Yakubu Dogara and minister of education, Malam Adamu Adamu, are at loggerheads following allegations of imposition of party officials.\n\nA faction of the party has asked Mai Mala Buni, Governor of Yobe State and National Chairman of the party to perish the idea of imposing candidates by \u201cpowerful Abuja\u201d politicians.\n\nChairman of the stakeholders committee from Bauchi South Senatorial district, Adamu S. Noma, who addressed the media at the NUJ Secretariat, yesterday, appealed to the national leadership of the party to recognise Sanusi Aliyu Kunde, who it claimed was unanimously endorsed by stakeholders from the state.\n\nNoma said Kunde was the choice of the APC and that the seven member committee headed by Jibriln Sam never conducted any congress nor elected Babayo Aliyu Misau as chairman. He alleged that the so-called congress that returned Misau done in Abuja was abnormal.\n\nThey alleged that members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had infiltrated APC and assured that the new leadership led by Kunde would bring sanity to the party.\n\nIn Enugu, former commissioner for works, Chief Ugo Agballah and former vice chairman of the party, Adolphus Ude, emerged in parallel congresses. But the issue was, however, compounded as former military administrator of Gombe State and chieftain of the party, Group Capt. Joe Orji (retd) said he was the \u2018consensus chairman designate\u2019 of the APC in the state.\n\nThe faction of former senate president, Ken Nnamani, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and ex-governor Sullivan Chime, produced Agballlah, while that loyal to outgone state chairman, Dr. Ben Nwoye, Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu and consisting of the foundation members of APC in the state elected Ude.\n\nUde, in his acceptance speech, said as progressives, promoting equity, natural justice and prosperity was their watchword. He wondered how some persons wanted to foist Agballah, who he claimed had not been publicly admitted into the party as its state chairman.\n\nHe also alleged that the same leaders who recruited Agballah had earlier recruited Rev. Okey Ogbodo to factionalise the party, resulting in APC\u2019s woeful performance in 2019 general elections in Enugu State.\n\nBut Agballah said his victory marked a new beginning for the party in the state and the party\u2019s journey to Government House and promised to unite all members of the party in the state by providing committed and selfless leadership.\n\nOrji described news relating to the emergence of any other candidate as fake.\n\n\u201cI was actually the consensus candidate of Enugu APC stakeholders at a meeting convened by former Senate President and representative of the South East in the National Caretaker Committee of the party. In that meeting representing the three senatorial districts, they settled for me. So, I am the consensus chairman designate. Anything to the contrary won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nIn Ogun State, Senator Amosun, risks another suspension from the party following the conduct of a parallel congress, a source said.\n\nAmosun had in 2019 been suspended by the national headquarters of the party for working for the Allied People\u2019s Movement (APM) candidate, Abdulkabir Akinlade against the APC candidate and incumbent governor, Dapo Abiodun.\n\nLoyalists of the former governor had converged at the Alake\u2019s Palace to elect their state officials for Ogun State.\n\nThe congress produced Derin Adebiyi, Jide Ojuko and Toyin Adesiyan as chairman, deputy chairman and secretary, respectively.\n\nPandemonium, however, erupted at the congress venue as hoodlums temporarily disrupted proceedings before the situation was brought under control by the police and other security agencies on ground.\n\nA source claimed the national leadership of the party in Abuja had issued a query to the former governor on the chaos which emanated as a result of the parallel congress by his loyalists. But this could not be confirmed at at press time.\n\nIn Benue State, congress of the APC ended in the early hours of Sunday with the emergence of Austin Agada as chairman.\n\nAgada polled 1, 385 votes out of the votes from 1,500 delegates, while his co-contestant, Omale Omale who boycotted the election was said to have polled 27 votes.\n\nHowever, some leaders from Benue South Senatorial District popularly known as Zone \u2018C\u2019 has rejected what they described as unfair and unjust accreditation of delegates by the state congress committee.\n\nThe leaders include former senate president, Ameh Ebute and former minister of agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh.\n\nThe aggrieved leaders in a petition to the Abubakar Mohammed Luggawero-led Committee, insisted that list of delegates generated in Benue South and given to the committee was not genuine, hence unacceptable.\n\nIn Osun State, the committee for the state congress, however, said there was no parallel congress in Osogbo, except funeral or marriage ceremony.\n\nChairman of the National Committee for Osun Congress, Gbenga Elegbeleye, said any other congress apart from the one held at the Osogbo City Stadium was a \u201cmere funeral ceremony.\u201d\n\nElegbeleye, at a news conference, yesterday, at the party\u2019s secretariat in Osogbo, said the committee was not aware of any parallel congress in the state as being speculated. A faction within the party,The Osun Progressives (TOP), loyal to former Governor Rauf Aregbesola, held a parallel congress on Saturday, while the Ileri Oluwa group, loyal to Governor Gboyega Oyatola, held its congress at the Osogbo City Stadium, where the immediate caretaker chairman of the party, Mr Gboyega Famodun, was re-elected as chairman.\n\nTOP, at a parallel congress, elected the immediate secretary of the party, Alhaji Rasak Salinsile, as its chairman.\n\nElegbeleye, who described the insinuations of parallel congress in the state as a fallacy, said on no account could any congress be held outside the knowledge of the committee, as prescribed by the party\u2019s principles and guidelines.\n\nIn Adamawa, no fewer than 12 local government areas had voted as the congress election continued for the second day, yesterday.\n\nProf. Umar Katsayal, chairman of the election committee, attributed the delay of the election to intensive and thorough screening of delegates.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of the election is moving smoothly according to the party\u2019s rules and regulations,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nReacting to the crisis, National Secretary APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, reiterated the resolve of the party leadership to come hard on any person or group behind the emergence of any parallel leadership in any state.\n\n\u201cWe successfully concluded the first and second congresses in the wards and local governments by observing all the laid down rules and regulations, including satisfying the requirements of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). We, therefore want to sound a note of warning again that any congress outside what we have endorsed is an effort in futility. All we want to appeal to them is to respect the constituted authority by exploring the Appeal Committee option when we set it up. Again, we have a listening chairman who can attend to any kind of complaint from anybody. They don\u2019t need to bring the party down because of their selfish interests. It is not done that way. In any case, we don\u2019t want to overrate ourselves, otherwise I will say that we achieved 99 per cent successes in the three congresses we have conducted so far.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigeria\u2019s cooking gas crisis may take a turn for the worse in the days ahead despite latest statistics that Nigeria and the Africa continent, account for a paltry four per cent of global Liquefied Natural Gas (LPG) consumption in 2020.\n\nExecutive Director, Sahara Group, Temitope Shonubi, disclosed this at the African Refiners and Distribution Association (ARDA) conference 2021 in South Africa where he spoke on the role of LPG in Africa\u2019s energy transition.\n\nHe observed that LPG consumption in Africa is low compared to other markets, adding that Africa\u2019s consumption was 14MT (translating to 12 kilogram per person) in 2020, compared to Asia Pacific\u2019s 108MT ((27kg/person), North America\u2019s 74MT (123kg/person), Europe and Eurasia\u2019s 49MT (49kg/person), Middle East\u2019s 38MT (60kg/person) and Latin America\u2019s 34 MT (53kgs/person).\n\nShonubi noted that Africa had become reliant on imports to meet its LPG demand as a result of low crude oil refining capacity and absence of adequate wet gas being processed.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s refining capacity of 3,343,000 barrels per day is limited to just 20 countries; utilisation rates have fallen from about 75 per cent in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2020. Only six African nations have combined LPG storage capacity greater than 50,000MT.\u201d\n\nThis was even as the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers (NALPGAM), Mr. Bassey Essien, disclosed that over one million metric tonnes of gas were consumed by Nigerians in 2020, with about 65 per cent of the product imported by marketers.\n\n\u2018\u2018The shortfall is made up through importation. The implication is that the importers will embed expenses incurred into the price it sells LPG to marketers at the depots and terminals. This is then passed on to the end users of the product,\u2019\u2019 Essien said.\n\nBut to reverse the lagging LPG consumption figure for Africa, Shonubi disclosed that Sahara Group, will invest over $1 billion to enhance access to LPG in Africa and emerging economies in a bid to boost energy transition on the continent.\n\nShonubi attributed the low LPG consumption in Africa to the hurdle of affordability, absence of large-scale LPG storage infrastructure, minimal vessels dedicated to the region, low set-up cost of firewood and kerosene stoves, as well as negative perceptions and fear of explosions due to poor safety standards, among other factors.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "SERAP sues Buhari over plan to monitor WhatsApp messages",
          "text": "Socio\u2013Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari, asking the court to declare illegal and unconstitutional plan by the administration to track, intercept and monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people, as it severely threatens and violates the right to the preservation of privacy.\n\nThe suit followed the proposal in the Supplementary Appropriation Act signed in July 2021 to spend N4.87 billion to monitor private calls and messages. The amount is part of the N895.8billion supplementary budget approved by the National Assembly.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1240/2021 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking an order of perpetual injunction restraining President Buhari and any other authority, persons or group of persons from unlawfully monitoring the WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people.\n\nSERAP is also seeking a declaration that any monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is oppressive and draconian, as it threatens and violates sections 37 and 39 of Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended); Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cThe plan to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is an arbitrary interference by the administration into respect for family and private life, the home, and correspondence. It also fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality. The Buhari administration has legal obligations to protect Nigerians and other people against arbitrary interference and violations of their human rights. Monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages would grant free rein to government agencies to conduct mass surveillance of communications of people. The mere threat of mass surveillance, even when secret, coupled with the lack of remedy, can constitute an interference with human rights, including the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. Privacy and expression are intertwined in the digital age, with online privacy serving as a gateway to secure exercise of the freedom of opinion and expression. Therefore, targets of surveillance would suffer interference with their rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression whether the effort to monitor is successful or not.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as respondents are Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami and Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed.\n\n\u201cThe powers to conduct arbitrary, abusive or unlawful surveillance of communications may also be used to target political figures and activists, journalists and others in the discharge of their lawful activities. Any spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy. The lack of any safeguards against discriminatory decision-making, and access to an effective remedy shows the grave threats the purported plan poses to constitutionally and internationally recognised human rights.\n\n\u201cSection 37 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide for the right to freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy and correspondence, communications and private data. Section 39 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 19 of the Covenant also guarantee the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media. The UN General Assembly has condemned unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and interception of communications as \u2018highly intrusive acts\u2019 that interfere with fundamental human rights (see General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 71/199). Interference with privacy through targeted surveillance is designed to repress the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Surveillance of journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others simply exercising their right to freedom of expression \u2013 would lead to violations of other human rights. Targeted surveillance creates incentives for self-censorship and directly undermines the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to conduct investigations and build and maintain relationships with sources of information.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "WSJ: How Nigerian Military Bought Back Anti-aircraft Gun from Kidnapping Gang",
          "text": "*Criminal gangs flush with ransom money, extorting governments\n\n*Farmers sell land to free their children, incidence fuelling inflation\n\n*NAF describes allegation of payments to bandits as \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nUgo Aliogo with agency report\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has described how the Nigerian military paid cash to buy back an anti-aircraft gun that posed a threat to President Muhammadu Buhari, who flew through the endangered airspace to his hometown, some 80 miles away.\n\nThe report alleged that kidnapping gangs that encamped in Nigeria\u2019s Rugu forest had seized the anti-aircraft gun during a clash with a military unit. It stated that the ransom, almost $50,000 in crisp Nigerian bank notes, was paid to retrieve the weapon.\n\nSoldiers, intelligence officers, and mediators, who had visited the kidnapping camps, described a surfeit of munitions, which included more anti-aircraft guns acquired since the mission to buy one back.\n\nBut the Nigerian Air Force, in a statement, described the report that it made such payment to armed bandits as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State (and) other parts of the North-west,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt said despite the allegation, NAF conducted air interdiction in the area recently.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe attention of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to reports alleging that the NAF, through one of its personnel, paid the sum of N20 million to armed bandits operating in Jibia Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State in exchange for an anti-aircraft gun allegedly seized.\n\n\u201cThe report went on to state that the reason behind the payment was to retrieve the anti-aircraft gun which, it alleged, the NAF feared could be used against aircraft operating within Katsina State.\u201d\n\nNAF said there was no iota of truth in the allegation, adding that it is designed to cast aspersion on the service.\n\nIt alleged, \u201cThe said report is totally false. It should therefore be taken as fake news and disregarded. Indeed, we ordinarily would not have responded to such baseless and utterly illogical allegation but for the need to set the record straight as well as reaffirm the NAF\u2019s unflinching commitment to decisively dealing with the armed bandits and all other criminal elements.\u201d\n\nNAF stated further, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, it must be stated that there is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State, other parts of the North-west as well as other Theatres of Operation in the country.\u201d\n\nHowever, the federal government did not respond to THISDAY\u2019s request for comments.\n\nBut the foreign journal maintained, \u201cCriminal factions appear to be better equipped with larger-capacity advanced weaponry than national security agencies,\u201d quoting a confidential internal report presented to the president in July.\n\nWSJ further alleged that over several months, the militant leader had agreed to part with the truck-mounted 12.7 millimetre anti-aircraft gun in exchange for the ransom.\n\n\u201cHis men had plenty more munitions,\u201d he was quoted to have said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the army\u2019s weapons,\u201d according to an officer, whose account was corroborated by another senior Nigerian official involved in the previously undisclosed mission, the report said.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t pay, we kill them,\u201d a militant leader in Zamfara State, Shehu Rekeb, was quoted to have said in a phone interview.\n\nHis men were herdsmen, he said, who had been mistreated by the state and subjected to arbitrary arrests.\n\nOnce armed with machetes, they now have weapons on par with the military and collaborators inside the army, he was quoted to have claimed.\n\nMore so, the report disclosed that in forests in the North-west, the loosely organised criminal gangs that raised funds by kidnapping school children were now flush with arms, cash and operating beyond the reach of an increasingly fragile state.\n\nIn some instances, government officials in Africa\u2019s most populous nation have been paying the gangs to return stolen weapons and kidnapped personnel, WSJ said, citing confidential documents and interviews with senior military officials, soldiers and independent mediators, and one of the gang leaders.\n\nThe New York-based newspaper narrated how during one of the incidents, masked men emerged from the forest on motorbikes, surrounding a young intelligence officer clutching a cash-filled bag.\n\nIt said, \u201cAn hour later, the officer, who declined to be identified, was clasping hands with a leader of a diffuse network of criminals, whose campaign of kidnapping civilians\u2014including hundreds of schoolchildren\u2014has raised millions of dollars to build an arsenal of heavy weaponry they are using to wrest control of swaths of the north, including the president\u2019s home state.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s government\u2014still battling Islamic State militants in the North-east\u2014refers to the lesser-known criminal groups in its North-west as \u201cbandits\u201d, the WSJ report said.\n\nIt said several senior security officials described mass kidnapping for ransom as the country\u2019s primary new security crisis.\n\nThe report said one official, who had reviewed intercepts of bandit leaders\u2019 communications, described how the militants spoke of accumulating weapons to defend themselves from rival gangs and from government-backed vigilantes and to conduct increasingly brazen operations against schools, villages, state officials and each other.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re settling scores\u2026government cannot do anything,\u201d one senior government security said.\n\nThe bandits have seized more than 1,000 children from their schools this year. Thousands of schools have closed in a country, where half the population is under 18 and which has become home to the world\u2019s largest population of out-of-class children\n\nFarmers have abandoned their land or sold it to purchase their children\u2019s freedom, sending the price of corn, rice and beans to new highs. Hundreds of villages have been deserted, after fighting that has left a quarter of a million people homeless.\n\n\u201cMy son has been captive in the forest for months,\u201d said Bulus Kwoi, whose firstborn was one of 140 students abducted from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna in July. \u201cPlease, will you give us the money to free them?\u201d he appealed.\n\nMost of the bandits are from the Fulani ethnic group, a traditionally cattle-rearing society, whose herdsmen have been fighting for years with farmers over access to dwindling grazing lands.\n\nThe report also alleged that more recently, some herdsmen had reorganised into kidnapping gangs, seizing everyone from villagers to prominent politicians.\n\nLast month, bandits raided a military training college in Kaduna State, north of the capital, killing two soldiers, grabbing more weaponry and kidnapping a ranking military officer, a major at the country\u2019s national defense academy.\n\nConfident that they hold the upper hand, the bandits have called in to talk radio stations to boast of their weaponry and have invited journalists to photograph their stockpiles, WSJ reported.\n\nThe Nigerian Police last month said they arrested three suspects in the kidnapping of students from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna State.\n\nIn the past three months, bandits have been blamed for abducting political leaders and Catholic priests, and for regular killings of policemen. In July, the air force said a pilot was shot down over the Rugu forest after attempting an airstrike on bandit encampments there.\n\nThe report said bandits were a distant priority for United States policy makers focused on Nigeria\u2019s jihadist threat, though American officials said they had intercepted calls from suspected Islamist militants in the North-east, who were advising bandits in the North-west on kidnapping operations and negotiations.\n\nThe Nigerian military opened a new offensive last month, bombarding forest encampments with airstrikes from US-delivered jet fighters. The government ordered cell phone reception suspended across four states, cutting off tens of millions of residents, as part of a military offensive that some officials claimed was succeeding.\n\nVillagers have paid bandits to not kidnap their children, intensifying a protection racket. Unable to defend communities, the governors of three northern states have told citizens to pick up weapons, fuelling a local business of fashioning muskets from scrap metal.\n\n\u201cHardly a day passes by without a person being killed or kidnapped. No single day,\u201d Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari, had said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the people to rise up,\u201d he added.\n\nWSJ reported that the mission to buy back the anti-aircraft gun began with a handoff from a high-ranking air force intelligence officer in Abuja: a black zip-up bag he alleged was full of N20 million.\n\nIt was given to the young intelligence officer tapped to exchange it for the anti-aircraft gun the bandits had seized in an area, where Buhari frequently flew to visit his hometown of Daura.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThe officer flew to the town of Jibia on the border with Niger, where a dozen armed men emerged from the forest to meet him. They escorted him on motorbikes into thickening forest for hours, arriving at the home of their leader, a wiry man in his 30s, who collected the sack.\n\n\u201cWhile the bandits began disassembling the antiaircraft gun and attempting to strap it to a wobbling motorbike, their leader aired a series of grievances against the state: Vigilantes had kidnapped his father, young men could no longer earn a livelihood rearing cattle, and airstrikes were killing civilians in his camps. \u201cYou are bombing us from the air,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are killing our children.\u201d\n\nHis fighters were conducting reprisal operations against vigilantes and the army, which had helped them accrue a huge weapons stockpile, he said.\n\nEventually, WSJ said, the bandits strapped the antiaircraft gun across two motorbikes and began to wheel it out of the camp. \u201cThey made it look so simple,\u201d the air force officer said. \u201cThey made it feel casual.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Pledges continuous support in fighting insecurity\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi\n\nThe United States Government has described the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria\u2019s North-east as one of the world\u2019s most challenging and complex. U.S Consulate Public Affairs Officer, Stephen Ibelli, disclosed this at the Nigeria Info 99.3 FM \u201cSecurity and Development Summit\u201d, during a session on \u201cUS and Nigeria Security Assistance and Cooperation\u201d.\n\nThe summit was in commemoration of the radio station\u2019s 10th anniversary.\n\nIbelli pledged the U.S. government\u2019s continuous support to Nigeria in the fight against insecurity. He said estimates by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think-tank, showed that more than 350,000 people had been killed in the North-east since 2009, while about three million people had been displaced across the Lake Chad Basin region.\n\nIbelli further said the trail of death, destruction, and personal losses inflicted by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa was immeasurable. He said the North-west also faced the threat of banditry, a type of organised crime that included kidnapping, armed robbery, murder, rape, cattle-rustling, and the exploitation of environmental resources.\n\nAccording to the envoy,\n\n\u201cThese armed groups have terrorised communities, killed and displaced thousands, hindered socio-economic development, and threatened democratic governance.\n\n\u201cThere is also the farmer-herder conflict worsened by climate change, rising populations, and competition for dwindling resources.\n\n\u201cDisagreements between pastoralist and farmers that may have once seemed manageable and isolated have escalated into large-scale disputes that have resulted in burned villages, stolen cattle, destroyed farm produce, and violence.\n\n\u201cIllegal, unreported, unregulated fishing, oil bunkering, trafficking of weapons, narcotics, and people, as well as the on-going threat of Nigeria-based piracy and armed robbery at sea also pose a major threat to commerce, economic development and the environment for not just Nigeria, but the entire region.\u201d\n\nIbelli said countering these threats was a common goal for Nigeria and the United States. He stressed that the US mission in Nigeria would continue to work in concert with the Nigerian government, fellow diplomatic missions, and civil society to address the multi-faceted dimensions of conflicts and armed violence in the country.\n\nHe said the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \u201cbased in our Embassy in Abuja has the lead on coordinating the US government\u2019s humanitarian response, as well as helping to rebuild the basic civil institutions essential to re-establishing civil and social life in the hardest hit states and areas of northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs some of you may already know, the United States is the largest humanitarian donor in response to the North-east crisis, providing $1.45 billion since 2015 and supporting almost two million conflict-affected households.\n\n\u201cOur Public Affairs Section at the Embassy in Abuja also oversees our Countering Violent Extremism messaging efforts and provides support to train a cadre of indigenous messengers best poised to reveal the falsity and vileness of Boko Haram and ISIS propaganda. PAS Abuja also awards grants in support of Nigeria\u2019s response to the on-going instability in the North-west and North-central regions.\n\n\u201cSince 2017, Department of State and Department of Defense security assistance for Nigeria totals approximately $650 million. In addition to this assistance, the Super Tucano sale is valued at almost $500 million and remains the United States\u2019 largest Foreign Military Sale in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nOn the import of the summit, he said it provided a valuable forum for frank conversations on critical shared priorities, including security cooperation, humanitarian assistance, and stabilisation efforts.\n\nHe said \u201cwithout security, it is impossible to have the stability and environment that is conducive to robust economic development and capacity building.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the fundamental role of a free and independent media in a democracy, Ibelli said journalists helped ensure that citizens were informed and exposed to diverse perspectives on key issues, such as national security.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWell-informed citizens make countries stronger, and the exchange of ideas is the foundation for accountable governance and development in addition to the economy. To this end, the United States will never rest in supporting initiatives that promote press freedom, access to information and freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nIbelli described the United States as Nigeria\u2019s partner of choice against insecurity, adding that a military response alone cannot lead to sustained peace.\n\nHe stated,\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s success does not just depend on its military effectiveness on the battlefield \u2013 it requires improvements to the economy, fiscal transparency, violence free elections, anti-corruption, anti-nepotism efforts, a welcoming business environment for investors, and governance off the battlefield as well.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a comprehensive, all of government response is necessary to build a better future in all parts of this great country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Exercises successful, ruling party congratulates members\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sunday said the crises in 20 state chapters of the All Progressives Congress (APC), where parallel congresses were held on Saturday to elect state officers of the party, were a clear reason why the nation was in conflict.\n\nBut the ruling APC has described the crisis-hit state congresses as successful and therefore congratulated its members for a good showing.\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, explained that the fractious congresses of the APC had shown how greed and lust for power by the partyleaders created crisis in all facets of the nation\u2019s national life.\n\nThe party described the APC congresses as a harvest of confusion in which leaders of the party engaged in physical, verbal and emotional assault against another, while using their thugs to unleash mayhem on party members with charms and dangerous weapons.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed despicable that a party that has the incumbent President of the country could not successfully conduct state congress, as their leaders were seen behaving recklessly and investing heavily in violence; a development that speaks volumes on why our nation has been under the heavy yoke of violence, division, bloodletting and acts of terrorism under the APC watch.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of APC congresses in many of the states has shown that it is a party that lacks leadership direction and internal cohesion; a party of unruly people, who are averse to peace, which explains why our country is reeling in crisis under the APC,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nThe main opposition party said the APC could not guarantee or give unity, tranquility and progress to the nation. Instead, it said, \u201cAPC has continued to worsen the tension in the country. It has continued to show itself as a party that is troubled from within and only waiting to implode at any time.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be wary of the APC. If the APC congresses turned out this bad, one can only imagine the type of mayhem that would characterise its primaries as well as their involvement in the general election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also said the APC state congresses presented an unprecedented scenario in the history of Nigeria, where a party, which produced the incumbent President, would have its ranks so torn down in shameful spectacle\n\n\u201cNigerians should make a correct interpretation of the signal sent out by APC congresses, which is that the ruling party is a mere contraption and an inchoate body of desperate elements. Such a party cannot organise for the genuine development of the country.\n\n\u201cOur party, the PDP is not however unaware of the efforts by the APC to inject crisis into our congresses but we commend the deft handling of issues in all our congresses to avert a crisis situation plotted by the APC.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the APC cannot lead Nigeria to the promised land. It can only worsen the current uncertainty it has hitherto unleashed on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe PDP remains the umbrella party that symbolises the yearning of Nigerians for unity, development, and security. The PDP is refocused to rebuild our national fabrics, reunite our people and chart a way forward for sustainable development in our country,\u201d it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement, described the parallel Congresses held in some states as mere naming ceremonies.\n\nHe stated: \u201cIn adherence to internal democracy and the charge by the leader of our great party, President Muhammadu Buhari that the party be returned to the people, card-carrying party members came out enmasse to elect executives, who will take charge of APC affairs accross the states for the next four years.\n\n\u201cHowever, our attention has been drawn to reports of so-called and purported \u2018parallel\u2019Congresses. To borrow the phrase of one of our esteemed governors, such \u2018parallel\u2019Congresses are mere naming ceremonies.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe insisted that the purported \u201cparallel\u201d Congresses are futile activities and very strange to the party, it\u2019s Constitution and the guidelines for the conduct of the state and other congresses.\n\nThe party noted that only exercises conducted by duly inaugurated state congress committees were recognised by the party.\n\n\u201cThe APC leadership will not hesitate to take adequate and lawful measures against any person or interest sabotaging the collective party\u2019s interest and efforts to achieve peace and unity in our great party,\u201d Akpanudoedehe added.\n\nHe assured members that where contestations existed, adequate conflict resolution measures had been put in place to address them, saying the party has Appeal Committees for every Congress.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*PPPRA: Domestic supply increased by 11,000mt in September\n\n*Kyari pledges more transparency in NNPC\u2019s operations\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite soaring cooking gas prices, which the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recently attributed to short supply of the commodity, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), yesterday stated that the market has continued to grow beyond expectations.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, yesterday, signed by the General Manager, Corporate Services, PPPRA, Kimchi Apollo, the organisation stated that Nigeria presently produces a major portion of the LPG consumed in the country locally, stressing that the so-called \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, remains on track.\n\nThe \u201cgrowth\u201d in the sector, the PPPRA stated, was because of the \u201cenabling environment created by the federal government through its programmes and policies to attract investment into the entire gas value chain.\u201d\n\nThe PPPRA stated that its assessment of LPG supplied in September 2021, indicated that out of the 76,578.986 metric tonnes of LPG supplied nationwide, 49,453.081mt was locally produced while 27,125.905mt was imported.\n\nIn the month of September 2021, it stated that the LPG data showed that 49,453.081MT was supplied into the domestic market by Algasco, Stockgap, NIPCO, 11 plc, Prudent, Greenville Natural Gas, PNG Gas, NPDC and Ashtavinayak Hydrocarbon Ltd with 66.58 per cent of the supply sourced from the NLNG, while 27,125.905 mt was imported by Rainoil, Algasco and Prudent.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy to note that the quantity of LPG sourced locally rose from 38,040.457mt in August to 49,453.081mt in September, while importation reduced from 47,224.346mt to 27,125.905mt.\n\n\u201cThe marked improvement in local production reflects the success of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva in providing the right enabling business climate for the gas industry to thrive,\u201d it stated.\n\nPPPRA stressed that policies and programmes such as the National Gas Policy (NGP), Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP), National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) and the Decade of Gas declaration were responsible for the quantum of investments in the gas industry currently.\n\nIt listed some of the investments as the NPDC Oredo Integrated Gas Handling Facility, Kwale Hub Gas Processing Plants (PNG, Ashtavinayak Hydrocarbon) Greenville LNG, Rivers State and the OSO/Bonny River Terminal project.\n\n\u201cIn terms of policies, the waiver of import duties on LPG production equipment as well as the zero VAT for locally produced LPG have indeed heightened the prospects of domestic investment in the sector,\u201d the PPPRA said.\n\nIn addition, it stated that the Pioneer Status Incentive (PSI) for some categories of LPG investments was also introduced, stressing that it remains committed to the development of Nigeria\u2019s vast gas resources and strengthening the entire value chain.\n\nIn the last one year, the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), otherwise known as cooking gas, has been on the rise and has more than doubled in several parts of the country, a situation largely blamed on the scarcity of the product.\n\nOther factors that occasioned the rise included forex scarcity, naira devaluation and rising inflation, excessive arbitrary charges by government agencies as well as the newly-added 7.5 per cent Valued Added Tax (VAT).\n\nNigeria currently consumes about 1.2mmt of LPG, with the Nigeria LNG (NLNG) currently 450,000mt to the market, while marketers are left to import the remaining 750,000mt.\n\nA 6-kilogram LPG refilling unit now costs between N3,500 and N4000, while that of 12.5kg refilling unit costs between N7000 to N8000, depending on the part of the country the transaction is done.\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, has stated that the corporation remains committed to conducting its operations with transparency and accountability.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by the spokesman of the corporation, Mr. Garba Muhammad.\n\nSpeaking when he received, \u201cThe Sun Man of The Year Award,\u201d in Lagos at the weekend, Kyari attributed the successes recorded by the management team of the NNPC to the, \u201cfreehand and support\u201d accorded him by President Muhammadu Buhari, who he said has never interfered with the affairs of the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done in recent years is to ensure that we take out all the opaqueness in NNPC. We also ensured that we represent Nigerians and work for them,\u201d the GMD added.\n\nSpeaking on the award, the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Newspapers, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh said Kyari was honoured for his \u201cdoggedness and resilience\u201d in the way he managed the operations of the NNPC during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, which saw the economies of many countries across the word struggling for survival.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Boss Mustapha: I\u2019ve No Idea How I Became SGF",
          "text": "A drive to the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, tucked right inside the Shehu Shagari Complex, within the Three Arms Zone, Abuja, presented a rather distinct picture of the nature of assignments the office is cut out for. Far-flung from the familiar hustle and bustle often associated with federal secretariats, the serenity here spoke volumes; although on a weekend, its character, it was said, never changes. With a visibly organised setting, including the human and material coordination of the office, Mustapha didn\u2019t waste time with informal exchanges and with a business-like mindset, gave the go-ahead for the engagement with THISDAY, which lasted a little over two hours. Excerpts:\n\nWhat\u2019s your passion? Seeing this picture of you with a horse, one wonders what your passion is all about.\n\nI am passionate about keeping animals, particularly horses \u2013 racing horses. I have a few that I keep here in Abuja, and back home in Yola, I have quite a couple of the local breeds: the Sudanese, the Arewa. They are all racing horses.\n\nDo you hire them out?\n\nNo. They go for competitions \u2013 local competitions. I also have horses in Kaduna \u2013 Pichoka. They are preparing for the race in Jaji, which is being organised by the armed forces sometime in November. You know, horse-racing in Nigeria used to come with a lot of royalty during festivities. That was then. It\u2019s now gone to the scale of what polo is. It used to be much more in terms of colour than polo in those days. But after a while, polo took over and I believe that it is going to return and that\u2019s what we are trying to do.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get down to brass tacks. What is your job description as SGF, what do you do? Someone once said the position of the SGF is making tea for the president. Is that what you do?\n\nWell, the Office of Secretary to the Government of the Federation is a creation of our Constitution, the 1999 constitution as amended, particularly section 171, which provides for the authority of the president to appoint people to certain offices. The first on that list is the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Basically, the mandate of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation is to coordinate government policies, monitor and ensure full implementation of those policies, programmes and projects.\n\nI also serve as the secretary to the highest policy-making body in the country, which is the Federal Executive Council (FEC), and also the Council of State. The membership of the Council includes the 36 state governors, the FCT minister, former Heads of State and former Chief Justices. So, those are the two most important functions. Also, the office is structured in such a way that we are the front-line advisor institution to the president.\n\nYou seem to have a lot on your plate.\n\nYes!\n\nSo, will it be correct to say this office is the brainbox of the federal government?\n\nWhether brainbox or not, I will just say this is the office that provides the operational basis for the presidency. Technically, we provide the President with the secretariat to function efficiently and effectively. We also provide advisory support to the presidency and government\u2019s institutions. The office is structured in such a way that you have to coordinate the activities of government from a wide perspective, because you are dealing with agencies of government, ministries, or institutions, etc. So, it\u2019s really a mixture of a lot of things.\n\nThe job description you just reeled off is quite enormous. How do you coordinate? What\u2019s the biggest challenge coordinating all the ministries, MDAs, etc. and ensuring everything is in sync?\n\nYes, the skill you bring to the office is very, very helpful in your understanding of the responsibilities that are entrusted. One of the things that I know has helped tremendously in coordinating the office and also in ensuring that the contending forces do not fall apart is this: You see, in providing secretariat to the federal executive, we have 43 ministers, two have been dropped, so we have 41. If the president replaces the two, that will come back to the 43. They all come from different constituents with different needs and backgrounds.\n\nYour ability to coordinate that will be based on your strict adherence to extant rules and procedures. Once you do that, you will get a grip on what is happening.\n\nThe other thing is that I have received tremendous support from the President and that has been a source of strength for me to do some of the things to ensure that the government machinery was not in any way impeded, and work in harmony \u2013 collaborate, ensuring that there is a smooth working relationship with all agencies of government. I also interface with the National Assembly on behalf of the government. The interface is very, very important in dealing with the challenges of the office. It is better you do not underestimate the challenges. But try as much as possible to interface as often as possible, so that if the challenges are brewing, you\u2019ll be able to deal with them before they manifest and become a problem to the administration.\n\nYou came at a time the office was bedeviled with all sorts of allegations, and your appointment seemed to have turned the tide, stabilised things, while the image of the office has improved. What attributes did you bring to the office that have helped in reshaping public perception?\n\nThe first thing I will say in this regard is truly, the confidence that the President has in my ability to man the office. I came with a modest ability of managing men and resources, having served in different capacities, and having been involved in the eyes of the public in different fora. He has been a great source of support and strength. This has helped tremendously, taking into cognizance the fact that this office, as you rightly observed, is the front office of the president.\n\nThe ability and the tact you bring to the office in managing all tendencies have helped tremendously. You remember when I came in, the first thing I did was that I visited the National Assembly. That\u2019s one area, where at the beginning of this administration, there was a very, very sour friction. I paid them a visit and I told them that we are all in this together. That it\u2019s a partnership and shared responsibility. We know that they are an independent arm of government, but there\u2019s a dependency and we cannot promote that. This modest skill has helped me to also bring some harmony in the workings of government, because we have consciously come to realise that if we don\u2019t work together, we will not be able to achieve much.\n\nTell us, how did you get this job?\n\nI have no idea. I ascribe my appointment to God, who laid it on the heart of the president to appoint me at the time. But let me put it in context. In 2014 after the nomination of President Muhammadu Buhari, then a candidate, I was asked to be part of the campaign organisation and as the director of contact and mobilisation, my responsibility was to organise the campaign structure in terms of rallies, town hall meetings and logistics in terms of even movement, hiring aircraft, or hiring buses.\n\nIt was such an all-encompassing responsibility. I will say that was the last time I got into close proximity of walking with the president, then candidate Buhari. And I was part of the management of the election processes. We eventually won and I was appointed the Managing Director of National Inland Waterways. It was from there that I was appointed secretary to the government. So, that\u2019s why I said, I won\u2019t in any way know who recommended me but as I said before, I ascribe the appointment to God, who laid it on the heart of the president to appoint me.\n\nDid managing campaign issues prepare you for this position?\n\nOne, I have been in the political process for a very long time and served at different positions in party politics. At the time that we merged and became the All Progressives Congress (APC), I was a deputy national chairman. So, I had operated within the sphere of political influence to a large extent.\n\nBut what is your relationship with your predecessor, Babachir Lawal?\n\nMy relationship with all my predecessors is excellent. I will say from Chief Ufot Ekaette of blessed memory, who I served when I was winding down the PTF; I worked with him closely. If there\u2019s one man that was prophetic about my life, it was Ufot Ekaette. When I was serving him, one day, he looked at me, this was around 2000 or 2001, he was so impressed with the way I took on that responsibility, called me and said, Boss, keep doing what you are doing; you have a great future in public service ahead.\n\nDid he see you rise to become the SGF?\n\nHe was alive when I was appointed SGF. He was so excited. I even represented the government at his funeral. Babagana Kingibe, who came after Ufot Ekaette, is somebody that I was with at the Constituent Assembly in 1988 when I represented my constituency. He was appointed secretary of the Constituent Assembly that produced the 1989 constitution. After that, we were both in SDP. I was the chairman of the SDP in Gongola State (Adamawa), while he was our national chairman. We have had a long political relationship.\n\nThen Yayale Ahmed came. He is somebody I have known since 1988, when he was working in the Ministry of Internal Affairs with the late John Shagaya as minister. I think that was the first time I met him and we were very good friends and we had a harmonious relationship.\n\nThen Pius Anyim Pius, whom I have related with, and we have been very good friends. I\u2019ve had very cordial relationships with all my predecessors that are alive. I have tapped from their wisdom, and from their wealth of experience. I consult them when I am at a crossroads and that has enriched my ability to administer this office. I have a very cordial relationship with all of them.\n\nThe thrust of that question is, are you related to your immediate predecessor, Mr.Babachir Lawal?\n\nWe come from the same community in Adamawa. We speak the same language.\n\nOne of your major assignments has been to coordinate the national response to Covid-19 and for 19 months, you have led the charge at the Presidential Task Force. What are the challenges and can you say the worst is over now?\n\nLet me start by saying this is one of the most daunting experiences in the last 19 months \u2013 to run a national response to a virus that is unknown, unpredictable. It has been a daunting experience but I thank God. The challenge with the COVID-19 was the epidemiology of the virus, when it hit the world. It has been described as the most devastating virus so far. The truth about it and let me say it out loud and clear, the COVID-19 virus is not going away soon. It is here to stay. The question now is, what do we need to do to ensure that we are safe? What do we need to do to ensure that we remain here (alive) too?\n\nFor me, that is the biggest challenge. You are dealing with something that is not going to go away soon. The second is the fact that the epidemiology of the disease was unknown when it hit the world, and that accounted for why every country and every community was having one form of restriction or the other, and resorted to all manner of formulae on how to deal with the virus. Initially, we had a challenge of technology and availability of testing materials, because we needed to test to detect before you can put somebody into isolation and provide care.\n\nEverything about COVID-19 was important. None was homegrown. Technology was a major challenge. The availability of the garment, the PPEs that you need to use for the purpose of reducing the level of infection among health personnel was a challenge. Then came access to vaccines, and with access to vaccines came vaccine hesitancy. So you can see that we are in it for the long run. It is a sprint and a marathon. It was also such a fundamental need for us to try to balance lives and livelihood. It was a balance of the health of our people and the economy and the wealth of our people. That\u2019s what confounded the entire world and as I said, it\u2019s certainly not over. And I will not want to encourage anybody to think it is over, because there are many things that should be put in place to ensure that we keep protecting our people in the conscious realisation that it is not going away soon.\n\nCuriously, you haven\u2019t contracted the virus, when many people around you have. How did you do it?\n\nEven my household was infected. All my four children, right under my nose. But God spared me and my wife. God was gracious to us, honestly. But one other thing that I kept doing was adherence to the safety protocols. Even at home, you\u2019ll find me sitting down and wearing my mask. My children would say, \u2018Daddy you are home and you are wearing mask\u2019 and I would say, \u2018Yes, I am home, but that doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t wear a mask. When they got infected, I moved them into the Isolation Centre so that at least, whatever I was telling the Nigerian people was what I practised in my home. They were there for over seven days. Even when they did the test and confirmed that they were negative, I insisted that they stayed another two days to do another confirmation test.\n\nInitially, there were concerns about your choice as the chairman of PTF as many would rather an expert in the field had led the charge. But over time, you seemed to have completely taken charge. At what point was this turnaround?\n\nThe truth about it is that yes, initially when I came on stage, there was this feeling that what does he know about infectious diseases or even in the medical field? Why not an expert in the field, not just a general practitioner? But I think in the wisdom of the president, he felt that we needed to put up a robust national response that is multi-sectorial. And that is the advantage we had. We had the medical team, the experts were part of the presidential task force. But we also realised that there were other things that had nothing to do with the medical system.\n\nThere were issues of diplomatic engagements; there were issues that were going to border on how we handled our education system; there were issues of aviation movements \u2013 in and out; there were issues of internal security. We graduated from health, the major health concern of our time, which is the pandemic that was declared by the World Health Organisation, gravitated towards the adverse impact on the economy, which has completely compounded and confounded the world.\n\nThe economy of the world will take a long time to recover. For us here in Nigeria, and elsewhere, we gravitated to the level of security concerns. COVID-19 tactically gave birth to #EndSARS. So we are dealing with these three major planks, viz. health, security and economy. It became obvious that a leadership that will lean towards just the medical concern will not be able to provide the robust national and international response \u2013 the one we\u2019ve been able to provide. And I will always say it was in the wisdom of the President, when he set up the presidential task of COVID-19, he also set up a committee that will look at the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 and that was what gave birth to the economic sustainability plan.\n\nThe committee was chaired by His Excellency, the Vice President (Professor Yemi Osinbajo) to look at what we needed to do to restart our economy, to provide palliatives for the people, to provide some source of succour for the people, because people were losing their jobs, especially, the daily wage earners. They couldn\u2019t cope. The combination of all these things helped tremendously in giving me the ability to coordinate. In the list of ministers, I had Aviation, I had foreign affairs to deal with foreign engagements, I had the interior to deal with internal security matters, I had education, I had the environment along with the experts.\n\nBecause we had this crack team of young men, who are knowledgeable in the field of infectious disease, the world found them attractive today. To begin with, Dr. Chikwe is with WHO today as a result of our response. He is the Assistant Director-General in charge of a new institute that was established to prepare the world for future pandemic. This came about as a result of the nature of his robust engagement on the platform of the Presidential Task Force. Dr Sani Aliyu is on the African Advisory Council, which is chaired by the South African president and several other international platforms that have been provided.\n\nThis is part of the crack team we had along with their colleagues in the Ministry of Health. So, I believe strongly that, yes, there would have been a preference for a knowledgeable person that is a specialist but what in the wisdom of the president was needed was somebody that would have the political leverage of access. Because of COVID-19, I could see the president at any given time in the day. I could get in contact with him very quickly to receive direction as to the application and protocols and other guidelines that were issued. You remember when we started talking to the nation on a daily basis? We were reporting to him constantly as to what was happening, though a combination of that, we needed a leadership that would have access and would be able to create a multi-sectoral platform that would be able to give a national response.\n\nAre you saying with the benefit of hindsight, it was a very good decision?\n\nIt really was. It was because if you had somebody that was an economist, he would just stay with his economic rescue and leave out the health and the security challenges, but I had this bird\u2019s eyeview, and I knew what was happening. And because of the access, I had to report to the president, and decision-making, which is key, was quicker. We didn\u2019t have to wait. All I needed to do was what was the committee\u2019s decision on the way to go. I just headed to his house or office. To the glory of God and the confidence that the president had in the Presidential Task Force, not one recommendation was rejected, because he believed that we were operating based on science, national and global experience.\n\nTo what extent has the chairmanship of the PTF affected your main job of coordinating activities of the government?\n\nWell, I wouldn\u2019t say that it has affected it negatively, because even as my business is tocoordinate the government, in the peak of COVID-19, the government slowed down, we even shut down. The entire office became the primary responsibility of the government. I mean, COVID has exposed the weaknesses, even in our system. I keep telling people that, even in the most developed democracies, like the United States with many years of constitutional democracy, the weaknesses of the system were exposed, because I saw for the first time, the President of a nation contending with a Mayor of a city as to who was to place a certain regulation.\n\nI said all these 300 years, you have not sorted that out and also the area of economy, as I said, you can see the impact. And it also exposed the weaknesses of our system in terms of inclusiveness. The developed environment, they already had a system, where they could determine who needed help, or what the basis of the help was. We have a system where we\u2019re just trying to build a register of the poorest of the poor; we\u2019re trying to put in place the identity of our people. That was a major challenge. So, who do you give it to? Where do you find them? What is the system? What have you put in place?\n\nSo, I have come to the valid conclusion that, yes, COVID-19 was a major challenge, but it has also given us an opportunity to redress some of these inadequacies, and in a way, we\u2019re doing the best we can, especially in the area of medical infrastructure. When we started, there were only two laboratories that could do COVID-19 test. But, today, to the glory of God, it\u2019s notching up to about 150 or more; it\u2019s rising on a daily basis, both from the private sector and the public sector. A lot of isolation centers have been built. Our knowledge and our ability of management have also improved, because we are getting to understand it better, and our clinicians getting to know the modelling and how to provide care for people has improved tremendously.\n\nDo you think the national response to Ebola helped in mitigating how widespread Covid-19 would have been?\n\nTo an extent, it did. But I have always held this view that if we had banked on our Ebola experience, COVID-19 would have been tamed in a manner that would have reduced the rate of infection and fatalities in this country. What happened was that we did very well but after Ebola, we moved on and forgot about the fact that we needed to put some infrastructure in place.\n\nNigeria has been poorly treated lately by some nations over vaccination, when clearly the country does not produce its own vaccines. Why is this so and isn\u2019t it a function of poor diplomatic engagement on the part of Nigeria?\n\nThe truth about it is that we have not been treated badly. We have received a total of 18,283,780 doses of vaccines, substantially as a result of bilateral relationships, out of which we have for the first doses, administered 5.2 million in total, and the second doses 2.5 million. So, the total vaccines that are available in our cold storage system is 10.5 million.\n\nReally?\n\nYes, of the different brands of vaccines now, we have 10.5 million. There have been cases of vaccine nationalism, but as far as our country is concerned, we\u2019re not complaining. There is no vaccine shortage. At the heart of what we are dealing with now is vaccine hesitancy. How do we get people to take this before they start to expire? In addition, we are expecting at least, between now and February of next year, 26 million doses committed by COVAX. This excludes the supply of J&J procured by the federal government. You know, that was the COVAX facility, which was put together by developed nations, and which they paid for. Vaccines were supposed to be sent out to developing countries.\n\nOur first source of vaccines came from that and they have continued to come. Then there\u2019s the bilateral with governments of different countries on their own. Few days ago, we took a delivery from the US, we have also received from France. We\u2019ve received from Canada, we\u2019ve received from the UK and we keep receiving. So, we have also in the budget \u2013supplementary budget \u2013 made provision for procurement from a facility being funded by Afrieximbank. Countries have been asked to state what it is that they needed on the loan that is being provided by Afreximbank. For that, I think the total consignment that we are expecting is about 52 billion doses.\n\nOh, that\u2019s a lot.\n\nYes.\n\nPlus 26 million?\n\nYes, 26 million from COVAX, which comes to us at no cost. The G8 and G20 have paid. So,I think what you might be referring to are the protocols that have been put in place. But you can see that the protocols are not even for Nigerians alone. If a country puts up a protocol, because they\u2019re trying to protect their people, they\u2019re also looking at what is happening in your country. The latest coming from the UK. They have now said you can come into the UK if you are fully vaccinated without imposing any form of quarantine or self-isolation.\n\nBy my release yesterday (last Friday), which will come into force on Monday, the 25th, we are also looking at what is happening globally, as to the processes that, if you are fully vaccinated from wherever you are, you can come in and do a day-two test after you have done a negative PCR test in your country of departure 72 hours. If you have been vaccinated or partially vaccinated or unvaccinated, you obtain a 72-hour negative PCR test before boarding or arrival.\n\nWe demand that you go into isolation. You do a day-two test and you do a day-seven, though these are all protocols put in place so that you can reduce the rate of other infections of different variants, because the thing with COVID-19, some of the variants that will eventually show up might make nonsense of the vaccines that you have taken, and that\u2019s why most countries are now going for a booster shot.\n\nHow come Nigeria is not talking about the booster jab?\n\nLet\u2019s get our people to take this one first.\n\nLet\u2019s go to the ease of doing business in Nigeria. There are a lot of complaints about how difficult it is to do business in Nigeria. Even the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation alluded to it. Why is it that nothing is being done to ameliorate the situation, so that investments can come into the country?\n\nI can assure you that we have done a lot. Let me start. On the 18th of May 2017, when the Vice President was Acting President, the first Executive Order that was signed, Executive Order 01, was for ease of doing business. It was the first executive order in the life of this administration. The government appointed a special adviser on the ease of doing business to the president. We have, as of today, a committee that is set up specifically, to ensure the ease of doing business in Nigeria. So, everything that the government needs to put in place is in place.\n\nThat Executive Order was very, very categorical. That all MDAs must publish on their websites all the requirements that are needed; all the taxes that we pay, and if an application comes in, within a certain period of time, you need to respond whether with a rejection or an approval. If we do not do that, at the expiration of that time, it is taken as you have granted the approval, and that has helped tremendously in moving the country forward. From the position that we were on the Ease of Doing Business index, we have moved from 146 to 131 in 2019. This is quite remarkable. From 170, where we used to be on the index of ease of doing business, as provided by the World Bank. So, I believe that a lot still needs to be done. We need to get our MDAs to synergise and work in synergy.\n\nThe problem with Nigeria is, we work in silos. The MDAs, as much as possible, have tried to ensure that they work uniformly, and they work as one body. It is totally ridiculous, if I\u2019m coming to invest in Nigeria, I don\u2019t even know what the investment environment is. I don\u2019t have a one-stop shop, where I will make all the inquiries. And that was the essence for which the NIPC was established to be a one-stop shop about investment assistance. All these agencies might not be working optimally. But I believe with a bit of concerted effort, with a bit of synergy, things would change. And that accounts for why we give milestones or we gave deliverables to the ministers when they were appointed. That was their ministerial mandate.\n\nAs I said in my opening remarks, this is a performance bond between you and the president. You signed it. We got all the ministers to sign. We got all their permanent secretaries to sign. So, they do not escape responsibility saying, it is the political head that took the decision. We are taking small steps and making some progress. In actual fact, so much is being done, but I believe we need to do much more to attract direct foreign investment, because nobody will bring his money if there is a threat. Yes, we have regulations. The security situation is another factor. But all these are being dealt with.\n\nBut companies are pulling out of the country owing to the difficult business environment. For example, Shoprite recently sold its stake for a meager $10 million and took a walk. How do you feel about this and what\u2019s the government doing to create a more business-friendly environment?\n\nI totally agree with you that the environment has become a little bit cloudy, not as a result of the government\u2019s inability to put in place measures. But there have been a myriad of problems. Every investor, for instance, wants to invest in an environment that is secure; that is quite open. But in the last couple of years, one must acknowledge the fact that our country has gone through some traumatic experiences. Even the drumbeats of war can scare investors away. So, we have a lot to do inculcating in our people the need for them to be conscious of what they say about the country. That will determine how people relate to us. So, as to how I feel? I feel greatly concerned that businesses are relocating, because one, it would increase our level of unemployment. All these businesses were employing people and they shut down and left? What do you do with those hands that they had laid off?\n\nBut it also provides an opportunity to build your own brand of Shoprite. There are many Nigerians that are fully equipped in terms of resources. Our banks are big players on the African continent. Go to virtually any evolving country in terms of growth \u2013 growing economy \u2013 you will find our banks operating there. So, it means that they have the capacity to finance our people to step into this business. Shoprite was a collection center; everybody brought their resources but they brought organisational skills in terms of management. So,there are concerns and I\u2019m concerned, because it will just completely be a disruption in our efforts to ensure that the level of employment is down. But I also see that there is an opportunity for our people to study. I\u2019ve always said it, COVID-19 came with its own challenges, but it also provided an opportunity for our people to step up.\n\nMultiple taxation is another big issue and even successive governments have acknowledged this, yet, not much has been done?\n\nWe understand that the issue of multiple taxation is a problem and it\u2019s really killing businesses, particularly, the SMEs. But that is one price you pay for a federation. There are different levels and there are different players that are all in a quest to increase revenue earning. There are multiple taxes imposed, some either by government or communities or other bodies. So, it\u2019s a major challenge. But I believe that the present leadership or the Federal Internal Revenue Service, along with the tax board is doing the best they can and they also acknowledge that it is affecting businesses. But you see, on the part of the government, one of the biggest steps that we took to ensure that we created some kind of comfort for medium and small scale industry, was the Finance Act of 2020. It has sort of relieved certain kinds of businesses from payment of taxes. That was all in an attempt to ensure that the tax burden is heavily reduced. But I think we can do better.\n\nYour party, the APC came to power on a three-point agenda of tackling insecurity, corruption and revamping the economy. In your assessment, have you delivered on your vision and what are the challenges in achieving that?\n\nI would say we have delivered remarkably. We are not fully there yet and we keep reminding ourselves, even the theme for this conference, we still reminded ourselves. The theme was enhance security, fight corruption, and transform the economy. So, no let up on that because those were the three important platforms on which the President was elected and I believe coming in out of the experience of the last two retreats, we\u2019re clearly on the path of substantially meeting those objectives.\n\nLast year, when we had the second ministerial retreat, coming out of the inauguration of the ministers in 2019, when we did the nine priority areas, the level of attainment of successes in those areas was about 50%. In 2021, that was recently, it\u2019s quite reflective of the progress that has been achieved. The evaluators, who are independent of government, adjudged that if we go at the rate that we were going, we are likely to get to about 90% level of success in attaining the three deliverables that the ministers have been given. So, I believe that we are on course, we are not fully there yet. We will continue with the momentum we are working with and that is to be able to record major successes in the coming year.\n\nThere has been this diplomatic row between Nigeria and the UAE such that the two nations have not entertained any flights for some time. One, what really is the problem and two, what\u2019s the situation now?\n\nWe are making efforts to ensure that everything is resolved. On the Presidential Task Force Steering Committee, we have handed over that responsibility to the Minister of Aviation (Senator Hadi Sirika), because it\u2019s an aviation matter. We have a bilateral air agreement with the UAE and also the Minister of Foreign Affairs is dealing with that aspect. They have been interfacing. What really happened was, you remember when we had to shut our borders and airspace, what most countries of the world did to protect themselves. Later, gradually, we eased up on the process.\n\nAs Dubai was also easing up, it came up with another additional protocol to say that they will only admit passengers from Nigeria, on direct flights, if you are flying Emirates but if you have to go through a third country, like Ethiopia airlines, or Egypt or Qatar, you have to be quarantined in those countries for 14 days, before you get to Dubai. We felt that protocol was country-specific and discriminatory. It was on the basis of that, we said okay, you can\u2019t come, because we have searched your website, we have looked at all your releases, this only affects Nigeria. So, it\u2019s not just the issue, our national pride is there, because you can\u2019t single us out for such treatment. If the world is acclaiming our response, you can\u2019t single us out.\n\nMy understanding is that it is a combination of both health and business concerns \u2013 monopoly of the route as the other areas are cheaper and the aviation industry has suffered tremendously. So, everybody is trying to recoup whatever they can recover in the process. With that, we\u2019ve had this continuous delay. But I think we\u2019ve got it resolved now. There has been an interface between the Foreign Ministry, the Aviation Ministry, and the UAE authorities. The biggest challenge will come when the aviation globally imposes a vaccine mandate, because they\u2019ve started contemplating that in some parts of the world, which caused our minister of aviation to speak on behalf of African Ministers of Aviation in a statement, saying, it was not acceptable. So Africans are going to be hard hit. We won\u2019t be able to travel if we do not show evidence of vaccination. You won\u2019t be boarded. So, that is also ongoing. It is compounding the issue. We are trying to navigate but I can assure you that very soon, the issue with the UAE will be resolved.\n\nWhat does the government intend to achieve with this new directive to its workers to get vaccinated or be denied access to their offices from December 1?\n\nYes, we have issued a directive, we have made that pronouncement and we are going to follow up with an obvious service-wide circular from my office and the office of the head of service of the federation. One of the reasons we decided to take the step is to establish a safe working environment. And if you follow up the trends all over the world now, there is the issue of vaccine mandates. We\u2019re almost getting there.\n\nBut people are challenging that.\n\nVery soon, you will not be able to travel the world unless you produce evidence of vaccination. If you noticed, my release was very explicit. It\u2019s either you produce the vaccine certificate or show evidence that you don\u2019t have Covid, because one of the most important thing that you must do is to create a safe working environment; the second is to ensure we minimise any major outbreak, because the rate of transmission now is much higher than people think.\n\nRight now, in Abuja, the rate transmission is not what people think. It\u2019s killing people. The third thing is that we want to sustain productivity of the workforce. If you have a major outbreak in that particular area, it means that you will shut down the establishment completely. That happened to me here. That was even at the peak of COVID-19, some staff caught it and we had to shut down, fumigate and do all sorts of things. Everybody had to go for a test. We want to contribute towards the general herd immunity. Do you know that for us to get herd immunity in this country, we must vaccinate about 70% of our population?\n\nAnd Nigeria is just about 5% or even less?\n\nYes and this is not going away. Even in the developed world, it\u2019s not going away, because to get to herd immunity, a medical certificate is provided to 70% of your population. So, we want to contribute to that. I want to lead by example. If the president says, get vaccinated, and you see him on television taking the jab, it is leadership by example. Some states have gone ahead of us \u2013 Edo and Ondo \u2013 to implement vaccine mandates for workers. So, we are saying that is okay. Those of us that are in the public civil service of the federal government, let\u2019s get out first, so that we can meet all these five things that I\u2019ve mentioned. In addition to that, I included the foreign missions, because of our experience in the UK.\n\nYou remember when the President visited the UK recently, all the High Commission officials that came to him, had Covid? There was an outbreak in the mission. The mission had to be shut down, because of the outbreak. And some of the officials had something to do with either him or some of his officials. So, that\u2019s the reason we added our missions, because government officials will continue to travel, they will continue to mingle with our officials, and interact with the high commission in the different countries. So, we want to be on the same page in terms of vaccination.\n\nSo why is your government borrowing future generations into debt, because clearly, we can\u2019t repay the debt as things stand now?\n\nWe can repay this debt, because most of the borrowings were intended to develop infrastructure. And once you have the infrastructure in place, it is then you will be able to generate business. So, the payment of our loans isn\u2019t as bad as you think. Our debt is not as much. If you look at the ratio, the debt to GDP ratio, we\u2019re not doing badly. Most people will tell you that we have not even borrowed enough in relation to the size of our economy, and the resources available to us. And I totally agree. If we are borrowing for the purposes of building infrastructure, sustainability of the nation or to secure this country, which is very fundamental, I think it\u2019s not out of place. But I totally agree that we should be careful.\n\nOn how we deploy the resources borrowed, the truth is that, globally, it is a big challenge with resources. Every country all over the world, even the big majors are borrowing. Their borrowings are on a different scale compared to ours. Ours is just a child\u2019s play. So, I think one of the things that I have always advocated for is the fact that we must make sure that we internally are able to generate resources sufficiently to meet our capital expenditure, overheads and our budgetary requirements. We would have to deploy mechanisms that will look at leakages within the system; we\u2019ll have to look at indicators within the system. The resources that are realised are plowed back into the government\u2019s treasury and used equitably for the development of the nation but we should not borrow out of proportion. I agree.\n\nOkay. Now, the budget is so big, there is a deficit financing in trillions of naira. So, even before it takes off, you can see how unrealistic it is. Why do we have this bloated budget?\n\nAs mentioned by the president, when he submitted the budget, the 2022 budget is an evaluation of the performance of the 2021 budget, which is put at 60%. In terms of performance, we are hoping that we have a lot of potential to get the budget performance higher to about 90% before the end of the year. Because of the cash flow situation, the releases were kind of hindered but we have picked up. That is why analysis is 60%. We should be able to notch up to 90 per cent of the performance of the budget by the end of the year. The projections of 2022, I believe, were taken with an abundance of caution. We pegged the crude price at $57. But you know that is almost 83. Yes.\n\nBut we picked it as though we know that it might not remain at that level. But the point is that if we are able to begin to produce our target by 2023, we intend to ramp up production to 3 million barrels a day; we\u2019re doing 1.8 now or 1.7. That position is feasible. It\u2019s feasible. We believe that we should be able to conclude our negotiation with OPEC. We should be able to read that and also address your concern. I also addressed a conference in the Niger Delta on the need for peace, because you need a peaceful atmosphere to be able to commit to meet that projection.\n\nAgitation for power shift has taken a life of its own. There was said to be a gentlemanly agreement in the APC at inception for power to rotate between the north and the south and that agreement is being trashed now. Is this true?\n\nThe politicians have an innate ability to work the system out \u2013 and the party, and we\u2019ve always done that and we got away with it. I can assure you that. Even this one, will sort itself out. But, for the people, it has become a matter of contention and agitation. Talk to any politician that you know, who understands the dynamics of this game, they\u2019ll tell you that this matter will sort itself out, because every political party wants to win election. And they know what it means and what it takes to win election. They will balance it.\n\nLook, I was a part of 1993, when we got tired of the military rigmarole and we decided that, whatever they threw at us, we\u2019ll win the war. It was a conscious decision by politicians. We took a decision. After Abiola emerged, we looked at it, I was even considered as a vice presidential candidate; we played around it and we resolved that we wanted to win election. If we could take that hard decision of having a Muslim-Muslim ticket and Nigerians didn\u2019t mind. We went to polls and won. That\u2019s why I said this is our stage, we will resolve it. Leave us. We won that election; beautifully won. I believe that whatever agreement the politicians have, when the time comes, they\u2019ll sit down and resolve it.\n\nWe need a Nigerian president. All these agitations for a sectional president will not catch fire, because I\u2019ll always ask, if you have a president from your constituency, how does it affect you? If it\u2019s not going to bring any money for the country and development to the region, so, how does that help you? The truth about it is that, well, the tension is coming closer for all these agitations to be there, but I can assure you that the right thing would be done at the right moment, so that the party would want to regain power. The opposition party would want to take power. They know how to strategise and take power, because we strategised and took power from them. So, they know what it is. I am very confident that this matter would be resolved on its own.\n\nSecurity is a major problem today in Nigeria and despite the huge funds sunk into it, it appears government is at its wit\u2019s end. What really is the problem?\n\nOne, there are many challenges. Let me start by taking us back to when we came in. In 2015, when President Buhari came into the scene, there were about 17 or 27 local governments totally under the control of Boko Haram. In my state alone, two local governments didn\u2019t vote in the 2015 elections in their local government, because they were all refuges in Yola. That\u2019s the Michika Local Government and the Madagali Local Government. They voted in Yola. My Ancestral constituency, the ward, where my father comes from, voted in the local government headquarters because they had been traumatized and turned out of their ward area. But they had moved now to their local government headquarters to vote.\n\nBut by the time we came to the 2019 elections, everybody was voting in his constituency. I am just giving you this example to show you the picture of what had happened. That now, everybody had gone back home; gone back to their farms; gone back to their lives, and they were able to vote in the 2019 elections in their traditional places. Then, the North West was relatively calm. Now, the North Central, Southwest. So, the problems are myriad in nature and they are hydra-headed. We are dealing with terrorist organisation, bandits. We are dealing with farmers and herders\u2019 conflicts. We are dealing with secessionist groups; we are dealing with the Niger Delta agitators. It\u2019s a multiplicity of crises.\n\nSo, as you are making progress in one place, another one is springing up. I do not want to underplay or downplay security challenges that we have in this country. A lot of countries have not had one-third of our experiences and they have broken apart. So, we must be thankful that we still have a country, in spite of these very strong serial problems that we are dealing with. But you will also have to concede to us that so much has been achieved in dealing with the major security challenges. As of this week, we are talking about thousands of Boko Haram surrendering, coming as a result of the kinetic and non-kinetic measures that have been put in place, and the distraction that we have been able to cause for them within their leadership. You can see the benefits. That also comes with its own challenge because, these people have traumatized communities and now, they are coming back to those communities.\n\nFor us to handle that too is a major challenge and we are trying to do the best we can to ensure that, yes, receiving them, we are deradicalizing them, we are resettling them, we do not evoke the anger of the communities that have been traumatized. In the North West, the banditry that has reached unconscionable level, you would ask yourself, are these the same people of the same religion, the same tribe? What is then the problem? But, you see, you can tie all these security issues to things we have neglected to do for a long time: our failing value system \u2013 both from the home and the community, the absence of any civil authority at the local level.\n\nOften times when I hear people talk about local government, I wonder whether we know the amount of havoc we have created as a result of not allowing the local government to work. The truth is when you don\u2019t have any semblance of civil authority at the local government level, what do you expect? It\u2019s chaos you are looking for, because there is no semblance of local authority. The people wake up in the morning they don\u2019t look up to anything.\n\nHow about the secessionist groups like IPOB that practically wants to break away?\n\nThe truth about it is that it\u2019s a matter of concern for everybody, that Nigeria has come to this. We have had the unfortunate experience of fighting a civil war and we survived it. And I believe that someday with a bit of engagement, with a bit of understanding, that it doesn\u2019t pay any of us to go on its own. We should be able to resolve whatever the issues are, even with the current administration. All the outcry, I wouldn\u2019t say there are no concerns, there are concerns, but you see, the only way you can address those concerns now, is not by taking arms against the state. Nobody wants to go through that experience again.\n\nI remember when Senator Rochas was the Governor of Imo State, I had cause to go and organise the Southeast and did zonal rally, and I said, the presidency of Nigeria is there for the Igbo to take. But nobody has ever become the president of Nigeria without negotiation. Go and read the history of Nigeria. You must come to the negotiating table. But in coming to the negotiating table, you come with what you are offering and you\u2019ll receive counter offer. And I gave an example.\n\nObasanjo was a very reluctant president, but when the political class saw that he was likely the person that could pull us from where we were, they went and brought him. Yar\u2019Adua was an unwilling president. He was thinking about retiring to his home after his eight years of governorship in Katsina. But when the power brokers at that moment realised that, probably for some tranquility in the system, you needed someone with his character and mildness, they went and brought him.\n\nWhen Jonathan became President in 2011, Nigerians made him president on the streets of Lagos and Abuja and other places. When we formed the APC, it was an act of negotiation. The negotiation will get you where you are or want to be. I told them there. The skills that you have demonstrated in the industry, and trade and commerce, bring it to the negotiating table.\n\nBut people blame the president for these agitations, especially, his politics and appointments concentrated in a part of the country.\n\nThat is totally untrue. The president is the most dispassionate person that I have ever met. People don\u2019t know him. He\u2019s given his life serving this country all through. As a military person, he fought during the civil war. He served in different parts of this country. He has friends all over the place and I know him as a leader that is very compassionate. If you look at what he has done in the south in terms of infrastructure, and if you see the budget, even his north east does not have the level of investment that\u2019s in the south. The second Niger bridge alone has taken all the money and other forms of infrastructure that are taking place in that part of the country.\n\nWhen people talk about appointments, the Constitution provides that there should be a minister from each state and those ministers are appointed based on their constitutional locations. I know the one that\u2019s always been a thorny issue is not only the service chiefs but the security agents. I always tell people that, go back and look at it. Under Obasanjo, under Jonathan, you\u2019ll see that, there\u2019s always been this tendency of people picking people that they know; that they can trust, because those are appointments that are at the discretion of the president. I sit in this office and I can tell you statistics of people, who have been appointed from different parts of the country. Some states are doing catch up, some are far ahead.\n\nWhen they go to the statistics in the civil service, some are far ahead, while some people are coming with just 200, 300, some are in thousands. So, because probably those imbalances are being corrected, you will think as if it is coming from a particular zone. But I believe the issue of equity can always be addressed; can always be brought to the table. Let\u2019s discuss it and see how it can be addressed. But as far as I know this president, he has the largest heart in terms of accommodation and he is totally devoid of any extreme tendency.\n\nBut it is also believed that some of these agitations are being fuelled by the assumption that the north is not willing to leave power and that the negotiation is ongoing.\n\nNegotiation with who? You see, that, we\u2019ll always leave to the political parties to decide how they frame their candidature going into an election, because you can\u2019t determine for them. Relatively, every political party will always want to go to their places of strength, because you can\u2019t come into an election with a deficit, you always want to come into an election, where you are visibly strong, so that whatever you get is an addition to the aggregate of the force that you collected on a particular plate.\n\nBut I can tell you for sure that the north as a body has not taken any decision not to relinquish power. And that brings me to the point that I just made about negotiation. At the time Abdusalami was leaving, the active factor in the body polity could have decided to say, okay, our tenure was truncated by Shagari not completing his second term. He came from the north. But the exigencies of those moments, prevailed on the political actors to go and look for somebody from a different region, to bring him and work assiduously for him to ensure that he won election the first term and the second term.\n\nSo, sometimes when I hear some of the things, I say, well, probably people do not know and understand the dynamics of the politics of Nigeria, and they do not know the politician. No politician wants to be in the opposition. They know what to do to win. We\u2019ll get around this. The issue of the North not wanting to leave power, there hasn\u2019t been any decision as I know and I should know that the North wants to hold on the power. But the fact of the matter is that, the political parties would situate their candidature, where they think would optimally give them an advantage. Every political party will do that. In the states, they will do that; in the the local governments, they will do that. You want to situate your candidature, where optimally, you will have an advantage.\n\nYou are from Adamawa, a state under the control of the opposition PDP. As a major figure in this administration, how tough can that be and in what areas?\n\nI have said it several times that Adamawa is an APC State. In 2015, we had all three senators, we had seven members of the House of Representatives, PDP had just one member. We had two-thirds of the House of Assembly but as we approached 2019, a lot of internal squabbles came into the mix. When the party was merged, we needed time to blend and become one family and it\u2019s not only Adamawa that suffered that fate.\n\nBauchi was one too and a couple of other places and at the end of the day, we threw away our governorship. We lost other states: Zamfara and Rivers, because of these tendencies. Our inability to resolve the crisis aggravated the situation. But I can tell you that we are making every effort to ensure that we regain the state for the APC and I am confident we are going to do that. At the moment, two of the three senators in Adamawa are APC. Our gains are increasing by the day and if we can just remain one and stay true to serving the people, we will bounce back.\n\nIncidentally, you are also from the same state as the First Lady, Aisha Buhari. How have you managed this equally formidable force and still keep a calm demeanour?\n\nThe First Lady is my sister. She calls me her brother. We have a very good working relationship and that\u2019s one thing I always give to her. She\u2019s very passionate about the downtrodden, the vulnerable, the girl-child. And if there\u2019s somebody that is very anxious that we must succeed as a government, she is that person, because of the past experiences of how President Muhammadu Buhari had made attempts at getting to the presidency and succeeded at the fourth attempt.\n\nShe\u2019s passionate to see that he succeeds and that passion, sometimes, I mean, gets her out of the comfort zone, in pursuit of trying to ensure that we succeed. She\u2019s very compassionate. She\u2019s very passionate about the progress and success of the country, and I give it to her. There are very few people that are passionate, dearly love our country, Nigeria. And of course, my relationship with her is extremely important. And we are working together to ensure the progress of Nigeria.\n\nIn the next few months, this administration will begin a gradual winding down as Nigeria enters the 2023 election cycle.\n\nWhat is next for you after leaving office as SGF?\n\nFor now, my focus is to ensure that we finish well with the president accomplishing the task he set for himself. He wants to leave a sustainable economy, a peaceful and united country. So, tha is my focus. Not thinking beyond 2023, because the president is a firm believer in Nigeria, and I urge all of us that have had the privilege of working with him to ensure that we finish well.\n\nWill you run for the office of the president?\n\nHonestly, my preoccupation now is to ensure that we finish well. Finish very, very well to further reinforce that belief coming from the ministerial performance mid-term review, because of what I saw demonstrated. The problems are enormous like Ngozi and Adesina \u2013 all rightly observed \u2013 they are not insurmountable. We can surmount our problems and make Nigeria truly great. We are blessed as a nation in every facet of our lives. For now, that is the preoccupation.

          "title": "Why Nigerians Can\u2019t Trust An Igbo Person As President\u2014Media Businessman, Dokpesi",
          "text": "Chairman Emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, Chief Raymond Dokpesi says the separatist activities of Nnamdi Kanu, detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) would jeopardise the chances of the South-East region to produce the president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Dokpesi stressed that he is a firm believer in a united, indivisible Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that the emergence of IPOB and its influence across the South-East \u201chas complicated and undermined the agitation for patriotic Nigerians of Igbo extraction to lead this nation as far as the 2023 election is concerned.\u201d\n\nThe PDP chieftain added that if an Igbo President is voted in, Kanu would use militant tactics to blackmail and force the President to declare the South-East independent of Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the surrender of Biafra to Nigeria, Yakubu Gowon, declared 'no Victor, no vanquished' but clearly, since, the regions that have determined leadership have used this against the South-East and denied Igbos the opportunity to lead. Should that be used against the leaders and sons of the South-East today? Of course not!\n\n\u201cI have publicly come out to support and call on a Southeastern presidential candidate in the recent past, but the emergence of IPOB and its influence across the South-East has complicated and undermined the agitation for patriotic Nigerians of Igbo extraction to lead this nation as far as the 2023 election is concerned.\n\n\u201cIf nobody has told Ohanaeze Ndigbo before, the concern today from some other regions is that if Nnamdi Kanu plays the role of Aguiyi Ironsi in leading a militant revolt against constitutional government in the South-East under Igbo presidency, the president will be pressured by his base to facilitate the UN processes for the South-East to call for independence from Nigeria. Thus an Igbo President may be compromised in protecting the political and geographic boundaries of Nigeria whilst Nigeria remains under the threat of IPOB\u2019s secessionist activities.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t shoot me, I\u2019m just a messenger. It is unfair but neither the South-South nor the South-East nor the North-East has the votes combined to determine the presidency on their own. We have to negotiate with other regions and where prominent leaders express such concerns based on the similarities of our history and contemporary circumstances, it indicates to me that the South-East is not trusted with the Presidency in 2023. It indicates to me that the leaders of the South-East have not done enough before now in dealing with and addressing the challenge that IPOB poses to their aspirations in leading Nigeria. Why and what to do to change this narrative is a question for leaders and politicians from the South-East to determine but you can see and understand why we in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) must take a realistic, pragmatic and strategic approach towards supporting the North-East zone for the presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn Atiku Abubakar, the South-East not only has a friend and a detribalised Nigerian who understands the pains, frustrations as genuine aspirations of the people of the South-East but also is a believer in the restructuring of Nigeria, which both in the short term and in the long term, is necessary and critical to the growth and development of Nigeria in general and the minority regions in particular.\n\n\u201cBy supporting Atiku Abubakar from the North-East to victory in 2023, the rotation of power across Nigeria will have come full cycle and I believe that the agitation for a South-East presidency will be better accepted and appreciated by the incumbency and other regions in subsequent elections after 2023.\n\n\u201cSo taken in totality I do not intend to offend the South-East or any of its eminent sons who are more than qualified to lead this nation. The South-South and South-East regions have already produced PDP presidents in the fourth republic, so we have had 14 years in the presidency, while the North has only had 2-years under PDP.\n\n\u201cThe nomination of President Goodluck Jonathan at the 2014 PDP Presidential Convention weakened our support in the North and ultimately led to the APC and President Buhari taking over government in 2015. We need to retrace our steps as a party. We need to consolidate our base in the South-South and South-East and we need to reach out across other regions of this country presenting a detribalised Nigerian that will be accepted and trusted to build the best 'all-star' Nigerian team to get us out of our present quagmire without carrying the baggage of IPOB undermining their credibility.\u201d",

          "text": "Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, says the fiscal authority ministry is working with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to close the gap between the official and unofficial exchange rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe national currency is changing for N411/$ at the official segment of the market and N570/$ at the parallel market.\n\nMany believe the parallel market rate is a reflection of its true value.\n\nTheCable had reported that Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo called on the CBN to allow the naira reflect the realities of the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOsinbajo had said the exchange rate is artificially low and deterring investors from bringing foreign exchange into the country.\n\nWhile speaking during an interview with Bloomberg TV, on Friday, Ahmed said the government is focused on improving foreign exchange inflows.\n\nShe said that with the Dangote Refinery set to begin operation in 2022, the country would be able to save about 30% of its present current foreign exchange (forex) expenditure on imports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said that the country would earn forex through petroleum product sales to foreign countries.\n\n\u201cIt is our desire to be able to reduce the gap between the unofficial market rate and the official market rate. We are working with the central bank to do that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAgain, what we have to do is to improve the sources of foreign exchange earnings. Right now, the predominant source is oil and gas.\n\n\u201cWhen oil and gas revenues are not coming as we projected or when we have huge expenditure in terms of subsidy, we have the problem of supply not being able to meet demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLike I explained earlier on, with a saving of up to 30 percent of forex expenditure with the removal of the need to buy PMS from out of the country, we will have more FX to meet demand.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the surge in crude oil prices, Ahmed said: \u201cThe high price of oil means that we would be able to earn more revenue. At $85 per barrel is way above the $40 per barrel we have on our 2021 fiscal projections.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we also have the challenge of having to buy petroleum products for use in-country, because we do not have functional refineries. So that eats into the revenues we would have otherwise realised.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that although revenues were growing, expenditure grew at a much faster rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, we do have a revenue problem. And we are working to curtail expenditure by being able to limit agencies\u2019 expenditure to 50 percent of their revenues,\u201d she said.\n\nShe blamed Nigeria\u2019s high debt service to revenue ratio on the large expenditure base of the country.\n\n\u201cOur debt service to overall revenue is high because we have a very large expenditure base,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe have a large proportion of our budget dedicated to payroll, and Mr President had decided from the beginning of his administration that we were not going to disengage staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, you have to pay salaries, you have to pay pensions. And also, we have to fund the other arms of government, which are the judiciary and the legislature.\u201d\n\nGiven the success of the country\u2019s last bond, the minister said the country could approach the foreign capital market again this year.",

          "title": "Why Nigerian neobank, Sparkle, preferred local investors in $3.1m funding",
          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action.

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "M-Pesa, Opay, Telebirr, Palmpay: How Chinese tech is powering African fintech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Brace yourself for an exciting lineup of news stories in today\u2019s newsletter. So, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nWorld Food Day\n\nPaySika\u2019s $350 pre-seed\n\nA barrage of news\n\nNigeria\u2019s rising food inflation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome fish for your viewing pleasure\n\nEvery month, while drawing up the food budget, because I don\u2019t want to end up stranded in the market, I always add some more money to the previous month\u2019s prices.\n\nSometimes, it might hit the current cost; other times, it remained at the previous price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, a few times, the current prices exceed my budget, and I grudgingly part ways with more than I thought I would.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, on a year-on-year basis, food inflation in Nigeria increased by 19.57% in September 2021 compared to 20.03% in August 2021.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, however, food inflation increased by 0.20%.\n\nSo, what does that mean for the average Nigerian who spends almost 60% of their income on food?\n\nOur Reporters, Oluwanifemi and Chimgozirim, x-rayed this issue while attempting to give solutions and spotlighting three startups trying to solve this problem.\n\nYou can read it here: How agritech startups are helping to check food inflation in Nigeria\n\nPaySika\u2019s $350k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaySika\u2019s Founders\n\nOn Friday, October 15, 2021, Cameroon-based neobank, PaySika announced the raise of $350,000 in pre-seed funding from several angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria.\n\nThe startup aims to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa and is leveraging existing mobile money infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaySika offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram, using a chatbot.\n\nFor Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, the challenge of financial inclusion is quite personal. In 2017, after gaining admission into a prestigious French university, he almost lost his place when he found out he could not pay cash.\n\nIt may sound bizarre, but Nengwe had gone to France with his entire school fees in cash. And coming from Cameroon, where only 34% of the population have bank accounts, most people carried cash.\n\nTo get a fuller picture, our Reporter, Emmanuel, had a chat with Nengwe on the raise, how he was finally able to pay his school fees, and a lot more.\n\nYou can find it here: With $350k pre-seed, PaySika is building a neobank for the unbanked in Francophone Africa\n\nIt\u2019s raining news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining news\n\nUsually, the weekend is a barren wasteland, but it appears a lot happened this time, and I\u2019m thrilled to be sharing them with you. But I\u2019ll make it quick \u2014 emphasis on quick.\n\n1. MTN has said the network downtime on Saturday, October 9, 2021, was due to an error that shifted all 4G customers onto the 3G band, which overloaded the entire network. As a result, users will be refunded data and airtime used between 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Saturday, 16th October 2021. The telco sent this via SMS to customers yesterday, including a link to an apology video from MTN Nigeria CEO, Olutokun Toriola. Interestingly, WhatsApp BCs claiming the link as fraudulent have circulated groups. The telecom operator, however, clarified on its Instagram page that the link is, in fact, real.\n\n2. Nigerian blockchain-powered, Wi-Fi sharing startup, Wicrypt has raised $1.5 million in funding in what appears to be a seed round to expand into new countries. Founded in 2018, the Enugu based startup was bootstrapped until 2020 by Ugochukwu Aronu. The round was led by AU21 Capital, with participation from Inclusion Capital, Pluto Digital Assets, Cardano, PolkaFoundry, Sandeep Nailwal, Founder of Polygon, and several others.\n\n3. In other startup news, Nigerian retail-tech startup, Alerzo has acquired Fintech company, Shago payments to expand its growth. This comes after a $10.5 million Series A in August 2021, led by London-based VC, Nosara Capital. The startup now offers several digital services to informal retail establishments, including mobile airtime top-up, bill payments, and peer-to-peer transfers.\n\n4. Flutterwave is in talks to increase its valuation to $3 billion, barely eight months after attaining unicorn status. The company has made several moves lately, partnering with Airtel, 9mobile, and MTN\u2019s mobile money platforms. It has also made some interesting appointments in the US and Nigeria. Were they in preparation for this?\n\n5. Last but not least, on Friday, October 15, 2021, protest-besieged Eswatini shut down citizens\u2019 Internet access for two hours. Demonstrations resumed after the fatal shooting of a protester in Malkerns, 20km west of the country\u2019s largest city Manzini on Wednesday. A blackout was first ordered in July and lasted for several weeks.\n\nProduct-led growth with Netcore and Techpoint Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a concluding note, last week, we brought you news of the Product-Led Growth (PLG) for B2C mobile apps, founders\u2019 meet and greet hosted by Netcore, in partnership with Techpoint Africa.\n\nThe programme held on Thursday, October 14, was a success, with discussions about the importance of a product-led strategy in abundance.\n\nIf you missed out, you can get this ebook on product-led strategy here and keep an eye out for other exclusive events we will be bringing your way in the coming months.\n\nCatch up on last week\u2019s stories\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nA bit long, but: It\u2019s Time to Stop Talking About \u201cGenerations\u201d.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa currently operates in a hybrid co-living and remote work environment. About half of the team live on the same premises, and once every month, we take a trip to the market to stock up on food items. Almost without fail, we discover that the prices of foodstuffs have increased since our last visit. Often, we complain, but because we have to eat, we pay for the products.\n\nRising food prices have become commonplace in Nigeria in recent years. However, not every Nigerian can be like those of us who grumble yet pay. For most people, even the slightest increase in food prices could be the difference between sending their kids to bed hungry and having just enough to eat.\n\nI tried painting a picture of what food inflation looks like, but this tweet about the increase in the price of sardines does a pretty good job.\n\nI just bought sardine at \u20a6675.\n\n\n\nIt was around \u20a6600 two weeks ago,\n\n\n\nand \u20a6300 early this year. Advertisement September 23, 2021\n\nWorld Food Day is observed annually on October 16 to draw attention to issues surrounding food supply, production, distribution, nutrition, and starvation, among other challenges. To commemorate this year\u2019s celebrations, we look at issues that affect food production and supply in Nigeria, highlighting the work of two agritech startups.\n\nIn addition, we spotlight the effects of food inflation and steps Nigeria can take to meet its food requirements but first, what is food inflation and what causes it?\n\nCauses of food inflation\n\nFood inflation refers to a situation where the prices of food items keep increasing. When this happens, consumers have to spend more to get the same goods they got at different prices in the past. Demand outstripping supply and supply being affected are the two major causes of food inflation. In Nigeria, the second reason is often the reason for the increase in food prices.\n\nWhile writing this article, I took a trip to the local market where I spoke to the traders to understand why food prices are constantly increasing. Surprisingly, most traders were clueless. Nonetheless, they did provide some insights.\n\nThe first trader, who identified herself as Mama Imole (Imole\u2019s mother), could not categorically state why the prices of food items were constantly increasing. She, however, offered an explanation \u2013 the agricultural inputs needed by farmers, such as pesticides and fertilisers, had become more expensive. It, therefore, makes sense that they increase the prices of their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of fish\n\nAnother factor that affects the price of food is infrastructure, of which transportation is a major component. There is no fixed cost for transporting goods in Nigeria as the state of the roads often varies in different parts of the country. An increase in fuel/diesel costs could also affect prices. To recoup their losses, farmers/traders often pass these added costs down to the final consumer.\n\nInsecurity is another factor that affects food prices in Nigeria. Since 2002, the Northern part of Nigeria has been plagued by activities of the dreaded Boko Haram. In recent years, the herdsmen crisis has taken centre stage, further complicating an already disturbing situation.\n\nConsequently, farmers in the North can\u2019t go to their farms. For a country that imports a significant part of the food it consumes, any disruption of local production adversely affects the price of food items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEffects of food inflation\n\nEveryone feels the effects of food inflation but at different levels, from the mother who has to decide what to leave out while grocery shopping to the trader who has to sell almost twice as much to meet previous sales targets; there really is no winner.\n\nMama Imole believes that increasing food prices present a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. Traders can\u2019t sell as much as before because consumers\u2019 reduced purchasing power means they do not buy as much as they once did.\n\nMrs Adeniji, another trader, shares the same opinion. Since no farmer can produce all the food items their family needs, they buy what they need from others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more significant effect is one that Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of agritech startup, Releaf, points out. With Nigerians spending almost 60% of their income on food, he argues that it is more difficult for them to invest in themselves.\n\n\u201cThe impact on society is that people are unable to invest in themselves. So, on average, Nigerians spend 60% of their income on food, which only leaves the other 40% to invest in their education, health, passion, etc.\n\nSo if we want to create a world where Nigerians can reach their full potential, we have to create a world where Nigerians can decrease the portion of their income spent on essentials like food.\u201d\n\nTo put things in context, consumers in the US spent about 8.6% of their income on food in 2020, freeing up 91.4% for use in other aspects of their life.\n\nThe role of agritech startups in tackling food inflation\n\nLike other areas of the Nigerian economy, tech and tech-enabled startups have sprung up to solve the problem of food inflation. One such startup is Releaf. Currently playing in the palm kernel oil processing space, the startup purchases palm kernels from its network of over 3,000 smallholder farmers.\n\nThe startup developed Kraken \u2013 its proprietary technology \u2013 which it uses to crush palm kernels to produce palm kernel oil for its industrial clients.\n\nInfrastructural challenges dog the average entrepreneur, and logistics for agricultural products are a major challenge. Bad roads and insecurity add to the cost of transporting agricultural produce from the rural areas, where most of the production is done, to factories or markets.\n\nTo solve this problem, Releaf employs a decentralised approach when situating its factories. Rather than build factories in Nigeria\u2019s major cities, they site factories close to the farmers, thus reducing logistics costs and ensuring they pay farmers adequately for their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nFinancing is another issue that farmers face, one which Releaf tries to solve. In June 2021, the startup announced a partnership with OnePipe to offer digital financial services to the farmers in their network.\n\nAnother agritech startup doing great work in the space is Agricorp, a company that produces, processes, and exports spices. This month, it completed a $17.5 million Series A funding round with which it plans to expand its production capacity to 7,000 metric tonnes per annum.\n\nSince its November 2018 launch, the startup has reportedly supported over 5,000 smallholder farmers with inputs and training on agricultural best practices. Using its proprietary technology, Farmbase, the startup aggregates, registers, and pays farmers for products sold.\n\nCrop2Cash is another startup solving problems in the agricultural value chain. One way it does this is by providing financing for smallholder farmers, most of whom are financially excluded. The startup also provides them with agricultural inputs and options to receive payments digitally.\n\nA plan for food security\n\nAs the cost of food rises in Nigeria, it is clear that something must be done, and quickly too. Data from Statista shows that food insecurity increased steadily from 6.6% between 2014 and 2016 to 21.4% between 2018 and 2020. In plain terms, the number of Nigerians who go days without food has increased.\n\nWhile agritech startups are doing a great job, more needs to be done if Nigeria is to feed its growing population. The most obvious is a massive investment in infrastructure to aid the transportation of produce. Moody\u2019s estimates that Nigeria needs to spend $3 trillion over the next 30 years to fix her infrastructure deficit.\n\nGiven that figure is over 20 times Nigeria\u2019s annual budget, other means of funding infrastructure must be explored, including public-private partnerships.\n\nIn addition to fixing infrastructure, effectively fighting insecurity would ensure that more farmers can return to their farms.\n\nFood is a basic necessity, and a hungry nation can have devastating effects on the economy and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office suddenly felt much colder as the young man took in the departmental officer\u2019s words. His dream of being one of the foremost robotic engineers at a top university in the Francophone world seemed to have ended before it even began as he encountered an unexpected problem.\n\nHe had told everyone who cared to listen in Cameroon that he was going to the prestigious Toulouse III University \u2013 Paul Sabatier in France to study, and he had gathered enough resources to make it happen. After a tense five-hour flight and barely enough rest the previous night, he didn\u2019t understand what he was hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, to be sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t pay with cash Monsieur,\u201d the officer responded, \u201cYou have to deposit at the bank and make the payment electronically with your card.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeeling hopeful once more, he thanked the officer. He darted out of the office, making a beeline for the nearest bank, where he excitedly informed the cashier of his intentions and received another shocker.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a school certificate to open a student bank account and get a card.\u201d\n\nThe young man was at his wit\u2019s end. He couldn\u2019t register for his student certificate without paying with a bank card, which he couldn\u2019t get without his student certificate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault that he went to France with cash to pay his registration fees and tuition. After all, he\u2019d left French-speaking Africa, where barely 20% of the population had access to banking services, so that was the obvious option.\n\nThe young man in this story is Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, a neobank looking to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa. PaySika has just raised $350,000 pre-seed from Angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria to fund this mission.\n\nAlongside Stezen Bisselou-Nzengue, Co-founder and CEO, Nengwe is building PaySika on Francophone Africa\u2019s existing mobile money infrastructure. It offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on their favourite messaging apps. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nIts chatbot helps users open an account, request free physical and virtual debit cards, and make transfers with these messaging apps without having to download the PaySika app or use its website.\n\nWhile the registration requirements for neobanks in Nigeria, for example, implicitly require you to have a bank account already, PaySika requires the phone number associated with the widely used mobile money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mission has given him the confidence of investors like Charles Edouard Bou\u00e9e (former CEO of Roland Berger), Benjamin Chemla (founder of Stuart), and several others.\n\nNengwe\u2019s Toulouse experience was four years ago, in 2017, before he and his co-founder knew how to build chatbots and financial services applications.\n\nAs he sat in the bank, not knowing what to do next, a sandy-haired middle-aged man with what looked like a never-ending smile walked into the bank with deliberately measured steps.\n\nLooking around and waving at some familiar faces, he spotted Nengwe, whose hands covered his face as he tried to calm himself down.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked Nengwe as he got within earshot, his perpetual smile still in place masking his seriousness.\n\nNengwe glanced at him, unsure if trusting a stranger in a foreign country was his best move.\n\nRealising he didn\u2019t have much choice, Nengwe explained his situation as calmly as he could.\n\nWhat followed was the stuff of dreams, the kind Nengwe had before leaving Cameroon.\n\nThis stranger offered to pay his fees with his card and collect cash. Probably more surprising was the man\u2019s seeming familiarity with his story.\n\nThis man turned out to be one of Nengwe\u2019s professors at Upssitech, in Toulouse University.\n\nThis gut-wrenching episode was pretty much par for the course for Africans migrating to study in France. Bisselou-Nzengue, with whom he would later form a close bond, also had a similar experience after leaving his home country of Gabon.\n\n\u201cLater on, I helped some people by providing them with my card and had them give me cash back,\u201d Nengwe reveals.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s quick to state that this is not the case for students from Germany or even Asia; it happens to just people coming from Africa.\n\nA seed had been sown, albeit in unpleasant circumstances, and both men would begin thinking of ways to solve this problem, which they figured needed to be tackled at the roots. It was clear that they had to democratise access to cards and digital payments services in countries like Cameroon where, only 34% of its adults have a bank account, DR Congo (25%), and Gabon (58.5%), to mention a few.\n\nBuilding that first MVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika\n\nAfter graduating in 2019, he quickly decided that working for a company was not for him and began to put his knowledge to good use, testing some of his ideas.\n\n\u201cI started my first company, MyMoney, a chatbot that connected to users\u2019 bank accounts and sent notifications. But it failed because of product-market fit. We started working on PaySika right after,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nBeing one of the most regulated globally, Africa\u2019s financial services sector is not kind to newbie fintechs with no track record, so building PaySika wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.\n\nExpectedly, the inexperienced entrepreneurs were in dire need of cash to build PaySika\u2019s first MVP.\n\n\u201cWe entered French Tech Tremplin, a startup competition organised by the French government to invest in high impact startups. We received $23,000 that helped us in part to build the MVP at the beginning. This plus friends and family, and our own savings, of course,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nAfrica might have a distinct lack of senior developers, and local startups struggle to keep them, but PaySika is rapidly securing the goodwill of talented senior developers who experienced similar problems when moving to Europe.\n\nNengwe also reveals that while fundraising, he and his co-founder surrounded themselves with investors who understand the fintech and banking spaces.\n\n\u201cI would say we were lucky because we were able to get an amazing network of business people that really helped us understand how this startup business works.\n\n\u201cWe have investors with a background in banking infrastructure. We have some who are CTOs, and some who are really good at hiring. We just surrounded ourselves with people who are knowledgeable about key topics that affect us.\u201d\n\nA fully-locked MVP gives Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue the confidence to look for mature angel investors. Some of whom would later join its just-concluded round. But despite this funding, a mammoth-sized issue remains unresolved.\n\n\u201cThe financial sector in francophone Africa is heavily regulated. So we started scouring through all the details and regulatory requirements. We then partnered with some financial institutions that will help us implement what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he says.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2020, Bisselou-Nzengue, COO of PaySika, decided to hone his business skills to complement his technical background. He made the necessary preparations and left for Grenoble Business School in France for a year-long MBA in international business.\n\nThe new business he\u2019s building with Nengwe needs refining, but they seem to be headed in a promising direction.\n\nWith free physical and virtual debit cards and a 1% transaction fee on transfers, the startup does not look like it will be making much money. Nonetheless, Nengwe believes they are taking baby steps.\n\nThough the startup is yet to launch fully, it already has over 20,000 pre-registrations, mainly (90%) made up of young people aged 18 to 35.\n\n\u201cThis was gotten organically. We didn\u2019t do any sort of aggressive marketing to get people onboard. Just referrals from different people who are excited about what we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nThe future is within reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNengwe says he wants to make the PaySika customer onboarding process seamless enough to cater to people without mobile money accounts. Once it can get its banking licence, it plans to add a savings account service, which he believes would be a major cash cow.\n\n\u201cWe will innovate in the offline space, so our customers can also perform transactions offline. But definitely not USSD. We\u2019re also planning to hire more experienced developers and build a marketing team.\u201d\n\nPaySika has some interesting counterparts in Francophone Africa. Ivory Coast\u2019s Djamo is building a financial super app, and Julaya wants to help businesses reach the unbanked. Wave, a mobile money service provider, became the region\u2019s first Unicorn in September 2021.\n\nAs recently as last year, it seemed like there wasn\u2019t much attention being paid to French-speaking Africa, but that seems to be changing.\n\nFor Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue, their story with PaySika is just beginning, and we\u2019ll leave several blank pages to document what promises to be an interesting journey.\n\n*The conversations and narrative may not have happened exactly the way we told it. But everything was based on facts supplied by PaySika Co-founder, Roger Nengwe, and our research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "Child Miners: The dark side of the DRC\u2019s coltan wealth",
          "text": "Coltan is one of the world\u2019s most vital minerals, and 60 per cent of reserves globally are found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s (DRC) Kivu province. In 2019, 40 per cent of the global coltan supply was produced in the DRC.\n\nThe mineral is used in cell phones, laptops and other devices because of its particular ability to store and release electrical energy. As 5G technology grows, the demand for Congolese coltan will increase. But that is not good news for everyone in the DRC.\n\nMuch of the country\u2019s coltan is extracted using the labour of over 40,000 child and teenage miners. Coming from remote villages and towns in Kivu, they either drop out of school or have never had the opportunity to attend. The informality of the extractive sector provides attractive job opportunities for vulnerable children, who serve as a pool of cheap labour.\n\nChildren work as washers and diggers in dangerous conditions. They also engage in petty smuggling, selling coltan for a pittance in towns along the borders with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda. Doing adults\u2019 work in a hazardous environment, many child miners face harassment, abuse and ill health. Occupational hazards include daily exposure to radon, a radioactive substance associated with coltan, which has been linked to lung cancer.\n\nFaustin Kantanga, a civil society leader in Bukavu, told the ENACT organised crime project that coltan mines were rife with prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases and rape, and that child miners were exposed to these risks. Those travelling long distances to smuggle coltan are also vulnerable to child traffickers and recruitment by armed groups.\n\nThe quantity of coltan mined using child labour remains uncertified and untraceable. The illicitly extracted mineral is traded in the underground economy and funnelled into the global supply chain through smuggling, counterfeiting and collusion.\n\nThe DRC government has taken several steps to curtail the use of child labour in coltan mines. Laws have been passed, and the country has signed some of the certification standards in the extractive sector. The DRC\u2019s mining code was reformed in 2017 to penalise the use of child labour or the sale of ore mined by children. In line with national legislation and supply chain standards, traceability and certification schemes have also been adopted.\n\nThe Certification, Expertise and Evaluation Centre (CEEC) of precious and semi-precious mineral substances, established by the Congolese Ministry of Mines, is in charge of tracing and certifying coltan. The body is mandated to collaborate with international regulatory agencies, from mining sites to commodity markets in Asia, Europe and North America.\n\nNotable international certification protocols signed by the DRC include the Regional Certification Mechanism of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, and the Dodd-Frank Act. The country is also a signatory to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for the responsible processing of minerals from areas in conflict, and the Conflict Minerals Regulation.\n\nHowever, all these commitments have not prevented children from being exploited in the DRC\u2019s coltan mines. Mineral certification schemes are not properly implemented, nor is the law regarding child labour and associated hazardous working conditions. While the frameworks are complementary, their feasibility in the eastern DRC is questionable.\n\nAdministrative capacity to ensure compliance is lacking and funding and staffing for the provincial departments tasked with monitoring child labour on mining sites are insufficient. Miners and extractive companies also circumvent the mineral certification protocols. Fieldwork by ENACT in the DRC revealed that the infrequent inspections were sabotaged by informants and even government officials whose warnings about upcoming site visits allowed miners to hide child labourers.\n\nIn sum, illicit coltan mining and trading in the DRC is enabled by the weak implementation of certification schemes, ongoing attempts to bypass regulations, and inadequate law enforcement. This casts doubt on the usefulness of all the certification schemes signed up to by the country.\n\nA different approach is needed. The Congolese government should constitute and fund an independent task force with a mandate to prosecute private and corporate businesses culpable of recruiting child miners. The enrolment of vulnerable children in school should be incentivised through ring-fenced funding and awareness campaigns to limit their recruitment into mining work.\n\nGiven the problem of child labour in coltan mines, the approach to mineral certification needs a fresh look. International pressure groups can advocate for the various certification schemes to be harmonised so that they can be uniformly applied in the eastern DRC\u2019s mineral-rich regions.\n\nDevelopment partners should help train and equip civil society observatory groups at the local level to monitor and submit regular incident reports covering child labour in coltan mines. Such \u2018shadow reports\u2019 would assist in validating or invalidating the certification audits carried out by state officials.\n\nOluwole Ojewale, ENACT Regional Organised Crime Observatory Coordinator \u2013 Central Africa, Institute for Security Studies (ISS) Dakar\n\nThe ENACT project is funded by the European Union (EU).

This principle has enabled the bank to focus on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that Nigerians without Internet-enabled phones can access the service,\u201d the CBN added.\n\nThe apex bank said the eNaira would complement existing payment options available via the mobile banking apps, Point of Sale terminals, USSD, quick response code and Internet banking, among other channels.\n\nGSMA, a global industry organisation that represents the interests of mobile network operators, had said in a recent report that 19 per cent of people living in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries did not have access to mobile broadband coverage.\n\nAccording to the organisation, about 47 per cent (210 million people) in sub-Saharan Africa do not use mobile internet.\n\nIn its design paper, the apex bank said to ensure inclusive access while also ensuring the integrity of the financial system, the account-based Central Bank Digital Currency model has been chosen for the eNaira.\n\nThe CBN said, \u201cThe account-based CBDC model at its core mirrors the progress made on the National Financial Inclusion Strategy which enables access to financial services by leveraging last-mile networks to identify users and to provide banking services through channels such as PoS and USSD.\n\n\u201cWith the account-based model, the CBN seeks to enable access by leveraging the existing identity infrastructure in Nigeria such as the BVN, NIN, TIN, etc., to uniquely identify individuals and corporate entities.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, identity frameworks such as the NIN will enable access for the financially excluded as they can be uniquely identified, thereby enabling the provision of financial services. These identity systems will help ensure a robust KYC framework positioned to enable access for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe CBN added that interoperability between the eNaira and other CBDCs was factored into the design of the eNaira.\n\nIt said this would help improve cross-border payments and address issues of dollarisation of the economy.\n\nVisa, a payments company, recently said ease of operating CBDCs would determine the success of digital currencies.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe believe that for CBDCs to be successful, they must have two essential ingredients: a great consumer experience and widespread merchant acceptance. It means the ability to make and receive payments, regardless of currency, channel, or form factor.\u201d\n\nAccording to Visa, as the number of digital currency networks increases, the likelihood that consumers, businesses, and merchants are transacting on the same network and utilising the same type of money decreases.\n\n\u201cBut interoperability ensures that different networks can communicate and share data with each other,\u201d it said.",

          "title": "NPLs: Oil & gas, agric loans threaten system stability",
          "text": "OKEY ONYENWEAKU\n\nSubtle fears are emerging at the moment that deposit money banks may no longer be able to keep, control and sustain low non-performing loans as required by regulatory measures, Business Hallmark has learnt.\n\nThe development which has emanated from the continued harsh operating environment for business in Nigeria appears to have reached unbearable levels for stakeholders in more recent times.\n\nThe banks seem to also be wearied by the rough circumstances which have overwhelmed them. The implication of this is that non-performing loans will very likely grow above the stipulated regulatory limits this year.\n\nHowever, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) must have heaved a sigh of relief when the non-performing loans in the banking industry fell to 5.70 per cent in June 2021 from 6.4 per cent in June 2020. But this does not mean the apex bank is resting on its oars. In fact, the Apex regulator has for a while very strictly monitored the banks to ensure that prudential guidelines are followed in extending credit to the private sector.\n\nWhereas the recent NPL of 5.70 per cent appears not threatening, the apex bank\u2019s target is 5 per cent. While the banks have shown resilience, the CBN has told commercial banks to review their loan exposure to oil and gas, agriculture, telecommunication sectors among others.\n\nSpeaking at the Financial Market Dealers Association (FMDA) annual conference in Lagos, CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele who was represented by CBN Deputy Director, Financial Markets Department, Patrick Ajani, said the move will help guarantee the stability of their operations.\n\nHe said because financial market was undergoing a litmus test and that the time was ripe to review sectoral exposure.\n\nSpeaking on the theme: \u201dRole of Financial Markets in the Nigerian Economy Post-COVID-19\u2033, Emefiele, said banks and other financial markets players had been directed to \u201cnow critically assess their exposure to different sub-sectors while continually leveraging technology to support their business operations and continuity\u201d.\n\nEmefiele asked banks to also critically assess third-party provider risks, including businesses within the value-chain of sectors funded by the banks. He urged the banks to sustain its tight prudential regime to bring NPLs below the five per cent provident benchmark. The cautioning of DMBs at this auspicious hour may be hinting at something serious or indicates that something is brewing.\n\nAre the clouds gathering again? Somebody had asked. Nobody is certainly sure. But Non-performing loans in banks have refused to berth at the target of 5 percent. This in fact, is not unexpected. After all, the business environment has been deeply unsettled.\n\nMany have always fingered high insecurity, the devastating effect of Covid-19 among other challenges of fluctuating crude of price, though priced fairly high today at over $80 pbd.\n\nMany are in fact, reminded of the disturbing effect of NPLs in 2009 which hit an all time high of 37 per cent back then. Ever since that time, the Central Bank of Nigeria has fought it with all measure of discretion that it came down to 3.0 per cent in 2014.\n\nBut the vulnerabilities which caused the spike of NPL s in banks are still causing problems in some quarters.\n\nThe Asset Management Company (AMCON) for one has been grappling to recover more than N5trillion which were heaped on its shoulders after the bad bank took those bad loans off financial institutions to give them a fresh start. The banks appeared reckless with loans which caused a hiccup in the banking industry with huge non-performing loans littered in almost all the banks.\n\nNon-performing loans (NPL) experts say is a bank loan that is subject to late repayment or is unlikely to be repaid by the borrower in full. One common feature of NPL is the period over which the principal and interest remain unpaid and un-serviced before a loan is classified as non-performing, they added. In Nigeria, NPLs is classified into substandard, doubtful, very doubtful and lost.\n\nBut Folashodun Shonubi, CBN Deputy Governor, operations directorate and an MPC Member was quick to add,\n\n\u201cThe non-performing loan ratio improved marginally to 5.7 percent, though it was slightly above the prudential, maximum of five percent\u2019\u2019\n\nThe MPC had noted in the last meeting that that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) both remained above their prudential limits at 15.5 and 41.3 percent, respectively. The Non-Performing Loans ratio (NPLs) at 5.70 percent in June 2021 showed progressive improvement, compared with 6.4 percent in June 2020.\n\nThe Committee, however, urged the Bank to sustain its tight prudential regime to bring Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) below the 5.0 percent prudential benchmark.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u2019An increase in credit risk exposure presents a serious concern for banks because the situation can easily degrade into financial trouble or bankruptcy. The higher a bank\u2019s exposure to credit risk, the much higher\n\nbanks tend to experience financial crisis and vice-versa\u2019\u2019, said an expert who wouldn\u2019t want his name mentioned in print.\n\nCBN\u2019s Director of Banking Supervision, Tokunbo Martins, had in 2016 at end of the 326th Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting held in Lagos said, \u201cIf people are finding it difficult to get paid their salaries and are not able to pay their loans, it is not unexpected. If corporates are not doing well as they used to do and they are not able to pay their loans, it is not something unusual to see the NPLs rising. The average figure of five per cent NPL is not out of this world.\u201d\n\nExcept for the rising price of crude, Nigerians believe the bad operating environment which elicited the above cautioning of banks to mitigate against the risk of high NPLs to their balance sheets, is dominant presently.\n\nAfter all , CBN data shows that the apex bank created N100 billion credit facility for the healthcare sector where 98 healthcare projects have been funded to the tune of N97.44 billion under the Healthcare Sector intervention Facility (HSIF) as of May 28.\n\nDetails also show the Targeted Credit Facility of N100 billion, and N1 trillion to manufacturing sector out of which over N600 billion had been disbursed to manufacturers.\n\nFrom January till date, N157.5 billion have been disbursed for 29 real sector projects under the Real Sector Support Facility, while N857.6 billion have been disbursed for 234 real sector projects from inception November 2018 till May 28, 2021.\n\nIn the same vein from January to date, N26 billion have been disbursed for 10 projects under the COVID-19 Manufacturing Intervention Scheme (CMIS) while N255.9 billion have been disbursed for 78 projects under the CMIS from January 2020 till May 28, 2021.\n\nIn the five-year Policy Trust of the CBN- 2019 to 2024, Emefiele promised to improve access to credit for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) as well as spur consumer spending to stimulate growth and enhance employment, among others.\n\nEmefiele said the resilience of the structure needed to support the financial market is very paramount in ensuring that the processes of keeping the banks stable is realised.\n\nHe said the industry players witnessed other pre-existing issues that were worsened by the COVID-19.\n\nAccording to him, in apparent reflection of the severe impact of the pandemic on the economy, 17 banks had earlier written to the CBN for permission to restructure 32,000 loans granted to individuals and businesses.\n\nThe said loans, amounting to several billions of naira, are going bad.\n\nThe apex bank\u2019s directive further reinforces the need for cyber-resilience in the face of rapid technology adoption.\n\nMany have observed that insecurity is affecting the massive agric projects that FG encouraged through single digit loans.\n\nDMBs and NPLs\n\nDMB\u2019s have in fact, shown seriousness in adhering to prudential guidelines to impede the rise of NPLs in recent times.\n\nFor instance, Union Bank of Nigeria Plc recorded marginal increase in NPLs ratio in the period under review, while Wema bank Plc record significant drop in its NPL ratio in the period.\n\nHowever, ETI Nigeria and FBN Holdings are the only two banks with NPL ratio above the regulatory threshold in H1 2021.\n\nAs reported in the H1 2021 unaudited results, ETI Nigeria\u2019s NPLs dropped to 17.per cent from 19.90 per cent recorded in H1 2020, while FBN Holdings reported 7.20 per cent NPL/Gross Loans from 8.80 per cent recorded in H1 2020.\n\nThe Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings, U.K. Eke had while commenting on the bank\u2019s H1 results said the macro and socio-economic conditions remain challenging given the COVID-19 pandemic and the low-interest rates environment.\n\nHe said the financial institution remains committed to its strategic objective of driving further stability in performance, as well as delivering sustainable growth over the years to come.\n\nFurther findings revealed that Wema Bank Plc\u2019s NPLs closed H1 2021 at 3.50 per cent from 5.60 per cent in H1 2020 just as Sterling Bank\u2019s NPLs declined from 1.90 per cent in H1 2020 to 1.79 per cent in H1 2021.\n\nIn addition, FCMB Group NPLs declined from 3.50 per cent in H1 2020 to 3.30 per cent in H1 2021, while Union Bank of Nigeria\u2019s NPL ratio increased to 4.30 per cent in H1 2021 from 4.00 per cent recorded in H1 2020.\n\nFurther analysis of the results showed a 13.4 per cent increase in FCMB Group NPLs to N3.78 billion in H1 2021 from N2.55 billion, dragging the financial institution NPLs by value to N32.21 billion in H1 2021 from N29.77 billion recorded in H1 2020.\n\nAnalysts attributed banks decline in some bank\u2019s NPLs to ease of COVID-19 lockdown, effective management of credit risk and reduction of risk to some sectors.\n\nCommenting on the decline in some banks\u2019 NPLs, the managing director, High cap Securities, Mr. David Adonri, extolled the banks for their ability control their non-performing loans and keep them low.\n\n\u201cIndustry gross credit increased by N6.63 trillion from N15.57 trillion at end-May, 2019 to N22.20 trillion at end-July, 2021. The credit growth was largely recorded in manufacturing, oil and gas and agriculture sectors.\u201d The CBN had noted.\n\nRecall that the CBN sacked the Boards of FBN holdings and FirstBank on Thursday 29 April 2021, saying the problems at the bank were attributed to bad credit decisions, significant and non-performing insider loans and poor corporate governance practices.\n\n\u2018\u2019The bank maintained healthy operations up until 2016 financial year when the CBN\u2019s target examination revealed that the bank was in grave financial condition with its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and non-performing loans ratio (NPL) substantially breaching acceptable prudential standards.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank also observed \u201cThe problems at the bank were attributed to bad credit decisions, significant and non-performing insider loans and poor corporate governance practices. The shareholders of the bank and FBN Holding Plc also lacked the capacity to recapitalize the bank to minimum requirements. This conclusions arose from various entreaties by the CBN to them to recapitalize\u201d.\n\nAccording to Emefiele \u201cThe insiders who took loans in the bank, with controlling influence on the board of directors, failed to adhere to the terms for the restructuring of their credit facilities which contributed to the poor financial state of the bank. The CBN\u2019s recent target examination as at December 31, 2020 revealed that insider loans were materially non-compliant with restructure terms (e.g. non perfection of lien on shares/collateral arrangements) for over 3 years despite several regulatory reminders. The bank has not also divested its non-permissible holdings in non-financial entities in line with regulatory directives\u201d\n\nFormer CBN Governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi had also on August 13, 2009 sacked the Managing Directors/Chief Executives and Executive Directors of five banks namely, Afribank PLC, Finbank PLC, Intercontinental Bank Plc, Oceanic Bank Plc and Union Bank Plc for reckless management of the institutions.\n\nThese chief executives were Mr. Sebastine Adigwe (Afribank), Mr. Okey Nwosu (Finbank), Dr. Erastus Akingbola (Intercontinental Bank), Dr. (Mrs.) Cecilia Ibru (Oceanic Bank), and Dr. Barth Ebong (Union Bank).\n\nSanusi said: \u2018\u2019excessive high level of non-performing loans in the five banks which was attributable to poor corporate governance practices, lax credit administration processes and the absence or non-adherence to the bank\u2019s credit risk management practices.\n\nThus the percentage of non-performing loans to total loans ranged from 19% to 48%. The 5 banks will therefore need to make additional provision of N539.09 billion\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the lender, non-performing loans imperils the capital requirement limits and therefore make it difficult to grant new and probably more quality credits. Non-performing loans weigh down a bank\u2019s balance sheet and the attendant charge offs decrease a bank\u2019s profitability.\n\nAccording to available research, countries with low non-performing loan ratio tend to experience faster GDP growth rate. Non-performing loans decrease banks\u2019 willingness and ability to lend as the banks tend to spend time looking to recover on such loans than making new loans,\u2019\u2019 said an expert who would not be named.\n\nAre we on the throes of another quite challenging deja vu moment then?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "summary": "The implication of this is that non-performing loans will very likely grow above the stipulated regulatory limits this year.\nThe banks appeared reckless with loans which caused a hiccup in the banking industry with huge non-performing loans littered in almost all the banks.\nThe Non-Performing Loans ratio (NPLs) at 5.70 percent in June 2021 showed progressive improvement, compared with 6.4 percent in June 2020.\nThus the percentage of non-performing loans to total loans ranged from 19% to 48%.\n\u2018\u2019For the lender, non-performing loans imperils the capital requirement limits and therefore make it difficult to grant new and probably more quality credits.",

          "text": "A mobile police officer has been shot dead following an attack on Effium Police Station in Ohaukwu local government area of Ebonyi State by suspected hoodlums.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Loveth Odah, in an interview with LEADERSHIP, said that the hoodlums attacked the police station with guns and patrol bombs by 12.00am midnight.\n\nShe explained that two vehicles caught fire as a result of the petrol bomb attack on the station by the hoodlums before they were repelled.\n\nAccording to Mrs Odah, \u201cAt about 23:50hours, on Sunday, a-yet-to-be identified gunmen came into Ohaukwu Divisional Headquarters to attack the division and the men on duty. But they were quickly repelled.\n\n\u201cIn the process, one police officer, a Sergeant paid the supreme price. They threw petrol bombs into the station and an operational and exhibit vehicles packed inside the police station, were burnt. That was what happened yesterday (Sunday).\u201d\n\nReacting to the incident, the chairman of Ohaukwu local government area, Mr Clement Oda, described the incident as unfortunate, noting that one of the offices at the station was badly damaged during the attack.\n\nHe also added that the rumour making the rounds that about 35 people were killed in the incident, should be disregarded.\n\nAccording to Odah, \u201cI got news of the attack last night and I called the DPO, who confirmed the incident. I was told the hoodlums used locally made dynamites to attack the place and from the report of the police, a police officer died during the attack.\n\n\u201cBut they were repelled. The policemen there, the MOPOL attached to my local government, the Area Command and the Ebubeagu jointly combined efforts and repelled the attackers.

          "text": "The Witness, a Nigerian newspaper in digital and print formats, is set to launch a non-governmental organisation, \u2018The Witness Newspaper Foundation\u2019, in commemoration of its fourth year anniversary.\n\nThe event is billed to hold on Sunday, October 24, 2021, at the Lagos Continental Hotel (formerly Intercontinental Hotel), Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nA statement on Monday by the managing director of the newspaper, Mr. Julius Akpovire-Enyeh, stated that the Foundation which is the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of the newspaper will focus on enhancing the education, health and empowerment of the less-privileged and vulnerable children, youths, widows and the aged in the society.\n\nAccording to Akpovire-Enyeh, \u201cToday, there are many children and youths who have dropped out of school due to lack of adequate support; there are a lot of less-privileged widows and the aged who are yearning for help.\n\n\u201cAs a responsible organisation, we aim to ameliorate the pains of these individuals and in turn contribute to nation building.\n\n\u201cThe underprivileged widows and their vulnerable children constitute a significant component of every country\u2019s population. Available statistics show that Nigeria has over eight million disadvantaged widows with over 21 million children. Many are stigmatised and blamed for their husband\u2019s death and displaced from their marital homes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe aged constitutes 5.2 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s population and the figure is expected to hit 6 per cent by 2025. But it\u2019s sad that in 61 years of independence from colonial administration, Nigeria is yet to enact a national policy on the care and welfare of older persons.\n\n\u201cThe rate at which the elderly are dying in the society as a result of inadequate healthcare and poverty is alarming and embarrassing to the country.\n\n\u201cThe Foundation will also tackle poverty and empower less-privileged youths. Although Nigeria is Africa\u2019s biggest oil exporter with the largest natural gas reserves on the continent, it was reported by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2019 to have 83 million people living below the nation\u2019s poverty line. Still, unemployment and underemployment are on the increase.\u201d\n\nThe chief host of the event is the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, while Dr. Emmanuel Eweta Uduaghan, the immediate-past governor of Delta State, is the chairman of the occasion.\n\nAmong other expected dignitaries are Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly; Mallam Mele Kyari, group managing director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC); Mr. Patrick Akinwuntan, managing director, Ecobank Nigeria Limited; Mallam Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, director-general/CEO, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Dr. Adaeze Udensi, executive director, Titan Trust Bank Limited and Dr. Victor Adoji, a former senatorial candidate and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe Witness Newspaper was founded in October 2017, with the mission of bringing its readers accurate and reliable information without bias, about happenings within the nation and abroad.",

Foreign nationals, including humanitarian workers, are likely targets for kidnap.\n\n\u2018\u2019Humanitarian hubs and workers have been targeted during attacks in the North East, including Monguno, Borno State on June 13 2020.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria. Kidnaps can be motivated by criminality or terrorism and could be carried out for ideological, financial or political gain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk of kidnap increases after dark.\n\n\u201cThe security environment in the North East has deteriorated since 2018 and there is a heightened risk of kidnap.

          "title": "Enough of this, we\u2019ve lost so much to sit-at-home, Igbo traders, residents declare",
          "text": "The sit-at-home ordered by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) across the five states of the South-east is fast impacting negatively on the populace, as business owners and residents alike have cried out in anguish to say they have had enough.\n\nFrom Abia to Enugu, Ebonyi, Imo and Anambra states, the trend remains the same as businesses have remained under lock and key while owners continue to comply with the IPOB order for fear of being attacked by the secessionists.\n\nThe order, which is to protest the continued detention of IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, commenced some two months ago.\n\nThough to be observed whenever the IPOB leader surfaces in court, it has however become a permanent feature as people are afraid to come out to avoid possible attack.\n\nMoreover, the group also declared the observance of the order every Monday.\n\nThe order intensifies as Kanu appears in court Wednesday to continue with his trial over alleged \u201cterrorism, treason, running an illegal company, publishing defamatory material and illegal possession of firearms.\u201d\n\nAbia\n\nIn Abia state, where there was partial compliance last week, for instance business owners who dared the order forcefully shut down when news filtered that hoodlums were attacking Ohiya Mechanic village, Umuahia over non-compliance.\n\nWhile there were skeletal services at the state secretariat, only one lawmaker was sighted by one of our reporters during a visit to the 24-member state legislature.\n\nAlthough no serious incidents or loss of lives as witnessed in other states within the region, the sit-at-home order has impacted negatively on the economic life of both the people and government.\n\nIn specific terms, those who earn their livelihood from daily earnings are not finding things easy.\n\nAccording to the residents, the situation has become so appalling that they, in unison, called for an end to the order for normalcy to resume.\n\nSpeaking on the development, President Umuahia Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (UCCIMA) Chief Nkem Chidi Aruoma said the \u2018Monday order\u2019 is badly hitting the economy of the state as well as those of ther states in the region.\n\nThe UCCIMA boss, who noted with dismay the economic loss worth millions of Naira, further said business owners do not open shops for business transactions on sit at home days.\n\nHe also said businessmen from neighbouring Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers states would prefer to visit other states free of restriction orders than coming to Abia state.\n\n\u201cWhen businesses are not open, it affects both individual businessmen and government\u2019s revenue base ,including the poor masses who hawk pure water for their living.\n\n\u201cEvery day there is sit- at-home, we lose hundreds of millions of naira. Transporters are not bringing out their vehicles on the road, shop owners are not opening for business, we are begging the agitators to have a change of mind before the South East is completely killed,\u201d Aruoma said.\n\nAlso, General Manager Abia State Passengers Integrated Manifest Safety Schemes (ASPMISS) Chief Ezinwa Abiri (JP) noted that Monday sit- at-home order was hitting the agency\u2019s revenue base \u2018below the belt.\u2019\n\nPrior to the order, he said ASPMISS as a self-sustaining agency used to pay salaries before the end of the month because they were generating revenue, saying \u201cthe agency has lost between N6 million to N8 million within these two months the sit-at- home order lasted.\u201d\n\nA female operator of Lotto games from Aba road Umuahia who craved anonymity, said the order has affected the volume of patronage.\n\nWhen Blueprint sought the reaction of a traditional ruler in the state, he turned down our request.\n\nAnd amidst all this, the state government has assured citizens to go about their lawful businesses, saying there is no cause for alarm.\n\nAnambra\n\nIn Awka, Anambra state, Blueprint reports that residents are passing through pains and agonies, while students missed their examinations and events rescheduled all in observance of the order.\n\nAlso, with less than a month to the state\u2019s governorship election, some political parties cancelled or postponed open campaigns, with some others taking theirs to Anambra residents at Lagos, Abuja, Rivers, Delta and so on., even as many others launched and maintained only online campaigns.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do anything for now. I will open my shops only when I see that people have done that too. I don\u2019t want to die or lose my wares. Would govt feed my family? They are telling us to open shops but it won\u2019t be possible unless we, the traders and markets agree to do if there is improved security. Truly, it is affecting us. We now have only five days to trade in the week,\u201d a trader, Mr Sunday Egwuatu noted.\n\nAn economist and former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Soludo, at a recent stakeholders\u2019 meeting posited that Anambra state alone lost a sum of N19.6billion at every sit-at-home.\n\nAlthough IPOB later announced cancellation of the order as well as its enforcement, people are still observing it out of fear of the unknown.\n\nUnknown gunmen and rival cult groups seemed to have latched on the \u2018loophole.\u2019\n\nCasualty figures\n\nFrom September 28 to October 11, 2021, not less than twenty persons have been gunned down by hoodlums in the state. Among them are Dr Chike Akunyili, husband of the late Minister of Information, Prof. Dora Akunyili; and Dr Lawrence Ezenwa. Vehicles, houses and other valuables were also set ablaze across the state.\n\nAt a recent interview with State House Press Corps, Governor Willie Obiano exonerated IPOB from the killings.\n\nOn why he was not at meeting of the south-east governors, the governor had said: \u201cHow did you expect me to sit down at table and discuss security with those who are sponsoring the insecurity and killings in my state? All I know is that we are going to find out the hoodlums and bring them to book!\u201d he stated.\n\nIn a broadcast to people of the state September ending, the governor said:\u201dNdi Anambra, these attacks and accompanying deaths cannot be justified and must stop now. I have therefore conducted an extensive security meeting and have directed all Security Agencies to step up and confront this monster ravaging our land. I charge everyone involved in the security architecture of Anambra State to take very seriously, this threat to our livelihood and boldly rise to confront same.\n\n\u201cTraditional Rulers, Presidents General, Clergy men, Vigilante Groups and all leadership structures must now take responsibility and in conjunction with the Police, Military and other Law Enforcement Agencies, work to restore order immediately.\u201d\n\nWe \u2018re vindicated \u2013 IPOB\n\nMr Emma Powerful, the IPOB media and publicity secretary said: \u201cWe are the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), under the able leadership of our Leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. We have always distanced ourselves from the senseless killings in Biafra land especially in Anambra and Imo States but some gullible fellows do not want to believe us. Now we have been vindicated by the recent confession by Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State on why he did not attend the meeting of South East governors in Enugu.\n\n\u201cFor the umpteenth time, let\u2019s restate that we have no hands in the senseless killings of innocent citizens in Biafra land especially Imo and Anambra States.\u201d\n\nFrom January till date, Anambra has hosted four commissioners of police. They are John Abang who was moved following his promotion to the rank of Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG).\n\nThe rest are Monday Bala Kuryas, February 18 to April 29; Chris Owolabi, April 30 to September 9; Tony Olofu, September 10 to October 7; and the current CP, Echeng Owolo, who assumed duty October 8.\n\nEbonyi\n\nIn a related development, there are also cries from business owners and individuals in Awka, Ebonyi state.\n\nIn an interview with Blueprint, the state Commissioner for Commerce and Industry and Businesses Development, Dr Stephen Odo said businesses and economy of Southeast had been affected.\n\nOdo sued for peace and pleaded with the IPOB to adopt a more acceptable approach in driving their demand home.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor business to grow, we really need peace not just peace but peaceful environment and serene environment, environment that has ability to stir confidence in the mind of people . Businesses entails people moving from one point to another point, and if at any point there is insecurity, nobody will want to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here we are in southeast we are suffering a self-inflicted problem because in self-inflicted problems, nobody achieves result by punching itself. For me southeast is just inflicting itself.\n\n\u201cWe are a region that is known by trade, by commerce and it involves day- to- day business transaction and activities. So, anything that hinders business activities is actually destroying the economy of the southeast and this is our pride,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinesses relocating from southeast\n\nThe commissioner also hinted that businesses were relocating from the southeast region.\n\n\u201cI may not have the data but it is obvious that when there are security challenges, people begin to take different decisions, so nobody can say it\u2019s not possible that a lot of persons, for a strange happening, must have left the region. It is possible because people look for environment where their businesses are secured, we are no longer assuring our investors that kind of security that we need to have.\n\n\u201cSoutheast used to be exceptional in terms of investment designations, southeast is notable for a peaceful coexistence, this is completely strange to our culture, this is completely strange to our environment, this is completely strange to the known ideology of the southeast, so it is possible that a lot of businesses are leaving. Imagine some banks closing up for a whole day or three times in a week, so it is possible that a lot of businesses may have considered looking for another safer region even closing some branches, and I think the earlier we address that the better for us,\u201d the commissioner further said.\n\nEnugu\n\nIt\u2019s same story in Enugu state where one of our correspondents quoted the apex Igbo cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, as pleading than an end be to the sit-at-home order.\n\nOhanaeze National Publicity Secretary Chief Alex Ogbonnia said if IPOB failed to stop the order, they might lose the respect and solidarity of the Igbo people, pointing out that their leader, Kanu loves the people and would not want the Igbo land to suffer unduly.\n\n\u201cI do not think the IPOB which Nnamdi Kanu represents would like to inflict hardship and injuries on Ndigbo. They would be playing into the hands of hoodlums even when IPOB has suspended the weekly sit-at-home, some hoodlums hijacked it and went on killing, maiming and destroying Igbo property.\n\n\u201cThey, IPOB, will lose the solidarity and sympathy of the people. In the process, the essence would become questionable and will become counterproductive,\u201d Ogbonnia said.\n\nAlso making similar plea, Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Chief Edward Ubosi, urged IPOB to let go of the order to save Igbo people from hunger and starvation, noting that many depended on daily sales and services to survive.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to note that the sit-at-home exercise being embarked upon in the Southeast zone is a great disservice to our people. This is because our people who mainly depend on buying and selling can no longer move about to fend for themselves. This is a time bomb,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nHowever, many continued to comply with the order for fear of being killed or injured.\n\n\u201cMe, go to market? I\u2019ll not go to market until this thing is over. I know that I am losing money any time I did not go but I\u2019ll not go out and risk my life,\u201d James Okoh a trader who deals in foodstuff at Garriki Market, Awkunanaw, Enugu said.\n\nOn the effect of the order, a former minister of power, Prof. Chinedu Nebo said: \u201cI foresee blood bath. Criminals have been posting names on the social media who are abroad causing trouble in Igbo land. I foresee a gang war and a bloodshed in Igbo land.\u201d\n\n\u201cSit at home today, sit at home tomorrow, what for? Who are those suffering these things? Is it not my people, our people? When I talk, they say I should concentrate on preaching the gospel,\u201d said the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nsukka Diocese, Bishop Godfrey Igwebuike Onah.\n\nImo\n\nLike all other states in the region, the weekly protest has continued to render all commercial banks, shopping malls, markets and business centres in Imo state inactive.\n\nA staff one of the banks along Bank Road in Owerri, the state capital, who pleaded anonymity said the protest \u201chas really affected bank businesses in particular and the country\u2019s economy in general as the usual turnover is not recorded.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince it started, the normal business atmosphere has disappeared as they open towards afternoon sometimes and don\u2019t open at all some other times for fear of their facilities being destroyed.\n\n\u201cLack of security from the state government has made it difficult to open. We feel that the government cannot provide enough security with which to fight for us when they come to enforce the order, so as a result, we prefer to lock up everywhere till the next day. And this makes our customers patronize Point On Sale( POS) operators scattered all over the place. This situation also makes us to have an uncontrollable mammoth crowd every Tuesday which slows down business, even at our Automated Teller Machines(ATMs).\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, traders in the markets and other business centres also suffered similar economic losses resulting from lockdown.\n\nFor Madam Oluchi who deals in rice and beans in cups and paint containers at the World Bank Market Owerri, replenishing their stocks has become difficult.\n\nAlso, for Uche, a Toyota spare parts dealer at Alaba Market at Naze, most of his customers come Mondays.\n\n\u201cThis means the sit-at-home has taken my customers and the money which would have gone into my pocket on that day. I suggest, we re-strategise for a better protest which will not affect our businesses as Ndi Igbo. You know we have families that we cater for,\u201d he said.\n\nSame pains are also shared by operators of commercial vehicles, commuters as well as residents, just as education which is the greatest industry in the state continues to suffer.\n\nFor instance, a parent, James Ajomiwe had complained about how his wards missed their English papers during one of the national examinations.\n\nWay forward\n\nOn the way out, Hon. Vincent Anthony Ubani, Director General, Nigerian Corporate Social Responsibility Fund, said all states in the region should allow the youth and people\u2019s choice to prevail against the wishes of the few.\n\nUbani also appealed to the federal government to fast track release of the detained IPOB leader and other Nigerians \u201cillegally\u201d held hostage by the security apparatus.\n\nCondemnation trails order\n\nAlso condemning the ugly scenario, the South East Igbo Youth Stakeholders said the order was negatively affecting lives, property and socio economic wellbeing of the people.\n\nThe youth, through their spokesman, Mazi Chukwuma Okpalezeukwu, observed that the challenges facing the region cannot be divorced from angers of the youth against the system and leadership, and appealed for a larger stakeholders meeting where all would brainstorm on ways forward.\n\nSimilarly, leaders of Ohanaeze Nd\u2019Igbo worldwide and the Anambra State Association of Town Unions (ASATU), at a recent joint press conference, urged the federal government to listen to the voices of people as \u201cit has become difficult for the elders to control the youths due to the perceived inequality meted out on the South East people.\u201d\n\nNational Vice President of Ohanaeze Nd\u2019Igbo Worldwide, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene and his ASATU counterpart, Chief Titus Akpudo, also sought release of Kanu and need for all regions in the country to be respected and treated equally.\n\nThe religious institutions have also resorted to prayers at their various churches for an end to the mayhem and peaceful Anambra state November 6 governorship election.",

AMAKA IFEAKANDU writes on the recognition this initiative and many others have attracted to the FBN globally.\n\nOver the years, the development in digital financial technologies across the world, like e-money, digital banking and crowd funding platform has tremendously changed accessibility of financial services.\n\nWith the advent of technology in the nation\u2019s financial landscape, financial institutions have become more innovative in their service delivery to their customers.\n\nInnovation in banking industry\n\nThe new innovation has, to some extent, placed the entire banking industry on the fast lane to brainstorm daily and think towards installation of efficient electronic devices that will meet the demand and expectations of customers in terms of service delivery.\n\nThe transformation in the industry which comes with speed and convenience, has become the order of the day as all Nigerian banks have keyed into different electronic banking applications to make transaction faster, easier and more customer friendly.\n\nFirst Bank digitalisation process\n\nAnd First Bank of Nigeria Limited, Nigeria\u2019s most valuable banking brand, is not left out in this digitalisation process. With over 127 years of experience to behold, the brand has remained committed to offering value-added services that suit the customers\u2019 lifestyle.\n\nThis decision birthed FirstMobile App in 2015 to provide convenient access to both financial and non financial transactions for First Bank account holders through their mobile devices.\n\nInterestingly, the unveiling of the products was another step towards leveraging evolving technologies to bring fast and convenient financial services closer to Nigerians in line with the bank\u2019s digital banking strategy.\n\nThe bank, in its effort to make cutting-edge banking services available to its customers, has continuously revamped its mobile banking application \u2013 FirstMobile \u2013 to boost convenience and ease of banking as well as enhance customers\u2019 digital banking experience.\n\nAcceptance of the Application\n\nIn less than 15 months after launching of the product, FirstMobile App recorded a milestone in its user number December 2016 with the attainment of one million active users, while over N1.3trillion transaction volume was consummated.\n\nThe product became more popular on daily basis that more customers got attracted to the use of the application\n\nAvailable data showed that as at June 2021, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, boasts of 4,596,203 users on the FirstMobile App which is a 9 per cent growth of the total users in the previous year and an average of 27,730,830 transactions every month.\n\nWith such increase in patronage from its over 30 million customer base, the need to always create an easy way for customers to conduct financial transactions comes into play, leading to creation of a dedicated platform that allows FirstBank customers to conveniently make transactions with their mobile phones, tablets and PC.\n\nBeating cyber attack\n\nObviously, one of the things that give bank customers sleepless night whenever it comes to electronic banking transactions is the problem of security. But\n\nthe FirstBank customers has nothing to worry about as FirstMobile App comes with a user-defined transaction pin which is an extra security feature.\n\nCustomers can also perform the following actions on the enhanced app: Change Transaction PIN, Reset Transaction PIN, Synchronize token, and change their log in pin \u2013 mPIN.\n\nAlso, FirstMobile is embedded with a card protection service for customers to enable and disable cards on channels, account switch off as well as second-factor authentication and device registration. Customers can remotely initiate the request for a new debit card as well as the replacement of a lost or damaged one, while managing activities on their card and account.\n\nFirstMobile takes into cognizance the security of customers and their funds.\n\nThe biometric for transactions is an innovative security upgrade on the application\n\nto validate transactions. This feature includes fingerprint for transactions, allowing the customer to use his or her fingerprint to consummate all transactions.\n\nOther features of the FirstMobile App include frequent transactions; dashboard flexibility and personalisation.\n\nAdded security features and easy transactions\n\nIn 2017, First Bank added new features on its mobile banking application \u2013 FirstMobile-to enhance security and protect customers from any form of cyber attack on their accounts\n\nThe new features are The Card-in-Control functionality, the Quick Response (QR) Code, the Transaction receipt and Save beneficiary functions.\n\nThe Card-in-Control functionality on the FirstMobile App empowers customers to be in control of their accounts and prevent unauthorized usage of cards.

Customers are to go to the Card Management Service, under the \u2018self- service\u2019 menu on FirstMobile to disable or enable any of the features.\n\nThe Quick Response (QR) payment solution on FirstMobile App allows customers to pay for goods and services by using their phone cameras to scan QR codes at merchant locations or uploading a QR code on a smart phone via the FirstMobile App. Payment goes straight from the customer\u2019s FirstBank account into the merchant\u2019s account and provides real-time notification to both parties.\n\nThe transaction receipt feature enables customers generate receipt after a transaction on the FirstMobile App. This feature overrides any concerns around the confirmation of transactions as receipts can either be saved to the mobile phone gallery for future reference or shared directly with recipients of each transaction via email, WhatsApp,\n\nAnother thing rooted into the FirstMobile App is the \u2018Save Beneficiary\u2019 feature, where customers can save beneficiary details for later transactions.

This much was acknowledged by the bank\u2019s CEO/MD,\n\nDr Adesola Adeduntan while addressing participants at the just concluded Fintech Summit.\n\n\u201cWe will also continue to demonstrate our support for start-ups and innovators in the fintech space by providing them the relevant data support and infrastructure to enable them scale appropriately.\n\n\u201cEvery step we take continues to be geared towards strategically positioning us as the bridgehead and reference point for fintech and financial services providers across the African continent, as we will continue to lead the charge towards realizing the future of banking,\u201d he said.\n\nReiterating his boss\u2019 position, Deputy Managing Director Gbenga Shobo said: \u201cFirstBank will continue to play its role in fostering thought leadership and innovation for the betterment of humanity.

          "text": "LiveScience Foundation Ile-Ife, in conjunction with a number of strategic partners, had organized the sixth National Conference on Environment and Health and disclosed the pitiable state of data generation, management, transformation, and use in Nigeria at the present time.\n\nContributing to the Conference theme: Harnessing the Potentials of Health Information and Environmental Big Data for Management of Public Health in Nigeria, the stakeholders expressed joy that a private-driven initiative had been able to bring together various delegates from key sectors to passionately discuss the subject. matter.\n\nThe delegates at the conference also expressed commitment to turning the current ugly situation around for the good of the\n\ncountry.\n\nAfter the two- day Conference, the stakeholders carefully noted the following: An enormous amount of premium data is continuously being generated in several sectors of national life in Nigeria, saying that if properly structured, appropriately transformed into information, and diligently harnessed, these data could potentially enhance public health in Nigeria and revolutionize the nation\u2019s environmental policies for optimal results in the quest for sustainable development.\n\nThey noted that specialized tools and technology, generally known as Big Data analytics, required to transform and interrogate the data to yield invaluable critical information are already available and are routinely deployed in several fields, including Economics, Social Statistics, Games, and Entertainment in the country, but there is yet no such activities in the very critical Environment- Public Health sector\n\nAccording to the delegates, this unfortunate situation would not be redressed until local stakeholders in the Environment-Health sector come together and consciously take matters into their own hands. \u201cNo help can be expected from foreigners in this matter as there are very few commercial incentives involve,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Conference noted that apart from sundry technical issues such as interoperability and accessibility, a major cog in the wheel of developing a robust functional Environment-Health database is the issue of governance and ownership, saying that due to a combination of lack of enthusiasm, transparency, and mutual trust, critical stakeholders had often failed to cooperate either in sharing their data in a common database or even patronizing such databases when strenuous efforts were made to initiate them.\n\nAlso, in their observations, the stakeholders said the National Conference on Environment and Health is already a huge step in the right direction and should be leveraged for more positive outcomes, saying that Health Records and Information Management Professionals (HRIMPs) are Key elements in this affair but unfortunately, they are currently not accorded due recognition for the important work they are trained to perform.\n\n\u201cOften, their space is assigned, on a part-time basis, to other professionals or even barely-trained casual staff. This turn of events has significantly hampered quality data generation, processing, and proper utilization. It has also left many HRIMPs discouraged on their job.\n\n\u201d In many cases, health data and information are generated and managed in silos within disparate entities (such as independently-funded Cancer registries), even within the same health facility. This has further created friction and sometimes tension in the management of health records and precluded the creation of needed health information,\u201d they observed.\n\nThe Conference, therefore, recommended that as required by accrediting bodies, every data-generating unit within the Health Information Management Department and the hospital at large should be staffed by well-trained and well-motivated Health Records Officers.\n\nAlso, health information and medical records should be integrated within the same health facility and efforts should be made to digitise them, as far as funds will permit.\n\nThe Conference said there is an urgent need for the establishment of a National Health Information Management Policy that will detail the procedures for the release of patients\u2019 health information for treatment, research and planning.\n\nOthers include: Stakeholders across various sectors must collaborate actively; Postgraduate students from academia (Universities, Research Institutes\n\nand other tertiary institutions) should be encouraged to tackle real-life problems in active collaboration with professionals in the industry and government Ministries, Departments, and Agencies; practitioners and professionals from industries and government MDAs are encouraged to apply for postgraduate studies (certificate).",

          "title": "Senate approval of e-transmission of results, direct pry will expand citizens\u2019 participation in politics \u2013 Lukman -NigPilot",
          "text": "Director-General of Progressive Governor\u2019s Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, has commended the National assembly, particularly, the Senate for passing the amendment to the electoral law which allows for electronic transmission of election results and direct primary for the selection of candidates by political parties.\n\nThe Senate had on Tuesday, October 12, 2021, passed the electoral amendment bill, which among others approved electronic transmission of election results and compel all political parties in the country to use the direct method of conducting party primary for the selection of candidates for electoral contests.\n\nAccording to Lukman, these are significant decisions, which could potentially enhance the credibility of Nigerian elections and expand the scope of citizens\u2019 participation in politics.\n\nHe expressed confidence that if the new electoral amendment is passed, it should be expected that the introduction of technology to the process of transmission of electoral results would similarly weaken the capacity of politicians to interfere or manipulate the election during the process of transmission of results.\n\nIn a statement issued Sunday and titled \u201cInternal Democracy in Political Parties and Prospects for New Nigeria\u201d, the PGF DG however noted that the success of the amendment would largely depend on the capacity of both Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and political parties to develop the needed organizational capacity to administer the new legal framework provided under the amended electoral law.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, this is a groundbreaking decision given that the physical process of transmitting election results from voting areas to collation centers gives space for rigging. Noting that since 2011, the introduction of card reader technology for voter accreditation has significantly weakened the capacity of politicians to inflate election results, which during previous elections produced voter turnout close to a hundred percent of registered voters.\n\n\u201cPrior to the October 12 decision of the Senate, there were proposals by many Senators and members of the House of Representatives that the National Communication Commission (NCC) should confirm that the national communication infrastructure can permit the electronic transmission of election results from every part of the country.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians criticize such a proposal based on the understanding that it will erode the independence of INEC, partly because subordinating INEC to NCC, being an executive body directly under the control of the President, would imply conferring some levels of advantage for the party controlling government at the federal level. The new amendment adopted on Tuesday, October 12, therefore, eliminated such potential advantages, which demonstrated a positive shift by the Nigerian Senate based on public criticism.\n\n\u201cThis is very commendable, and it significantly indicates a high measure of responsiveness by Senators of the Federal Republic. Nigerians hope that the Conference Committee involving members from the House of Representatives would eventually adopt the new amendment and President Muhammadu Buhari will eventually assent to the new bill.\n\n\u201cOnce that is done, the bulk of the work to operationalize the new law to effectively transmit election results from voting areas to collation centers electronically will be the responsibility of INEC. Given that INEC\u2019s institutional capacity for deployment of technology during elections has been testing successfully with the introduction of card readers since the 2011 elections, Nigerians expect that deployment of technology to manage the process of collation of results through electronic transmission of election results commencing with the 2023 election would also be successful and to that extent make Nigerian electoral process more credible. And like the introduction of card reader technology drastically reduced electoral litigation due to manipulation of accreditation, litigation arising from alleged manipulation of the collation process should also be reduced. With such development, the only aspect of Nigerian election that will not be technologically driven is the actual voting. This will mean that some of the challenges bordering on vote buying, which is very rampant would still be there.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important to continue to engage the debate about making the Nigerian electoral process more credible based on corresponding provision of electronic voting opportunity as part of the Nigerian electoral laws. Nigerian Senators should be commended for this landmark decision of approving electronic transmission of election results to be in Nigeria\u2019s electoral law. Investing INEC with such a responsibility independent of other agencies of government is a demonstration of a high measure of responsiveness by Senators. In the same measure, Nigerians who actively engaged the debate of the amendment proposals in the National Assembly, especially leaders of civil society organisations should be equally commended. Without their engagement, the decision of the Senate of October 12 may have been different,\u201d the statement reads in parts.",

A civil society group under the auspices of Pe\n\nIn a statement released to thank the legislature for heeding to the cry of Nigerian electorates, the group expressed optimism that now that the law which deprived Nigerians their natural right of choosing leaders of their choice has been amended, Nigeria is on the threshold of economic, and political recovery that will guarantee freedom, prosperity and peace to all.\n\nThe statement signed by the President of PLIF, Sir Precious Elekim\u00e0 regretted that Nigerians had never had the opportunity to elect their political leadership largely due to the porous and disenfranchising electoral law governing the conduct of elections in the country.\n\nSir Elekima on behalf of the People\u2019s Life Improvement Foundation heartily thank the National Assembly , Governor\u2019s, Religious Leaders, Nigerians, friends of Nigeria, on the Journey of given the power to the people of Nigeria for them to consent to who shall rule them as representatives of the people from the federal to the Local level. He said, \u201cFor nearly four years our organization, The People\u2019s Life improvement foundation saddled itself with the auduos task of ensuring that Nigerians truly understand the reason why our way of elections must change and only the people must elect their political leadership. Because, the constitution of Nigeria has vested the sovereignty of Nigeria on the people of Nigeria.\n\n\u201c\u201dPower belongs to the people\u201d , unfortunately it has only been on the lips , while the strong, rich, thugs, guns is what dictates elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore embarked on a crusade to educate the people of the reasons for the leadership failure in Nigeria. Knowing fully well that it will be a function of the National Assembly and the Executive branch to correct the areas that has robbed Nigeria the opportunity of electing the right leaders according to the the Holy Bible and the Holy Koran that introduced self government( democracy) (Government of the people by the people for the people) on the basis of human equality.\n\n\u201cThe process was for the people to elect or select those who they have seen as virtues men and women to be elected as leaders based on their personal accomplishments which will be used to judge them by the electorate who have to decide who to entrust their Treasury and resources for a given period of time according to the constitution.\n\n\u201cThis is process has been hijacked and clueless people foisted forcefully on the offices of leadership Nationwide which had led to the collapse of the country.\u201d\n\nElekima also appreciate the selfless men and women of PLIF who contributed by no small means to the successful engagement of the legislative and executive branch, and also were able to minister the gospel to other like-minded organizations who bought the idea to help spread the crusade. No one person could have been able to do it alone.\n\nHe added that, \u201cWhile we await the assent of Mr President , we congratulate the Legislative branch for a job well done and we also thank Mr President in advance for his signing into law this Landmark amendment to the electoral act.\n\n\u201cVirtue is the ingredient of good governance. We need good men and women to build a better society. Nigeria is almost a failed State this is the opportunity and time of restoration.\u201d",

          "text": "The United States Government has described the humanitarian crisis in Nigeria\u2019s North-east as one of the world\u2019s most challenging and complex. U.S Consulate Public Affairs Officer, Stephen Ibelli, disclosed this at the Nigeria Info 99.3 FM \u201cSecurity and Development Summit\u201d, during a session on \u201cUS and Nigeria Security Assistance and Cooperation\u201d.\n\nThe summit was in commemoration of the radio station\u2019s 10th anniversary.\n\nIbelli pledged the U.S. government\u2019s continuous support to Nigeria in the fight against insecurity. He said estimates by the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think-tank, showed that more than 350,000 people had been killed in the North-east since 2009, while about three million people had been displaced across the Lake Chad Basin region.\n\nIbelli further said the trail of death, destruction, and personal losses inflicted by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa was immeasurable. He said the North-west also faced the threat of banditry, a type of organised crime that included kidnapping, armed robbery, murder, rape, cattle-rustling, and the exploitation of environmental resources.\n\nAccording to the envoy,\n\n\u201cThese armed groups have terrorised communities, killed and displaced thousands, hindered socio-economic development, and threatened democratic governance.\n\n\u201cThere is also the farmer-herder conflict worsened by climate change, rising populations, and competition for dwindling resources.\n\n\u201cDisagreements between pastoralist and farmers that may have once seemed manageable and isolated have escalated into large-scale disputes that have resulted in burned villages, stolen cattle, destroyed farm produce, and violence.\n\n\u201cIllegal, unreported, unregulated fishing, oil bunkering, trafficking of weapons, narcotics, and people, as well as the on-going threat of Nigeria-based piracy and armed robbery at sea also pose a major threat to commerce, economic development and the environment for not just Nigeria, but the entire region.\u201d\n\nIbelli said countering these threats was a common goal for Nigeria and the United States. He stressed that the US mission in Nigeria would continue to work in concert with the Nigerian government, fellow diplomatic missions, and civil society to address the multi-faceted dimensions of conflicts and armed violence in the country.\n\nHe said the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \u201cbased in our Embassy in Abuja has the lead on coordinating the US government\u2019s humanitarian response, as well as helping to rebuild the basic civil institutions essential to re-establishing civil and social life in the hardest hit states and areas of northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs some of you may already know, the United States is the largest humanitarian donor in response to the North-east crisis, providing $1.45 billion since 2015 and supporting almost two million conflict-affected households.\n\n\u201cOur Public Affairs Section at the Embassy in Abuja also oversees our Countering Violent Extremism messaging efforts and provides support to train a cadre of indigenous messengers best poised to reveal the falsity and vileness of Boko Haram and ISIS propaganda. PAS Abuja also awards grants in support of Nigeria\u2019s response to the on-going instability in the North-west and North-central regions.\n\n\u201cSince 2017, Department of State and Department of Defense security assistance for Nigeria totals approximately $650 million. In addition to this assistance, the Super Tucano sale is valued at almost $500 million and remains the United States\u2019 largest Foreign Military Sale in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nOn the import of the summit, he said it provided a valuable forum for frank conversations on critical shared priorities, including security cooperation, humanitarian assistance, and stabilisation efforts.\n\nHe said \u201cwithout security, it is impossible to have the stability and environment that is conducive to robust economic development and capacity building.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the fundamental role of a free and independent media in a democracy, Ibelli said journalists helped ensure that citizens were informed and exposed to diverse perspectives on key issues, such as national security.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWell-informed citizens make countries stronger, and the exchange of ideas is the foundation for accountable governance and development in addition to the economy. To this end, the United States will never rest in supporting initiatives that promote press freedom, access to information and freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nIbelli described the United States as Nigeria\u2019s partner of choice against insecurity, adding that a military response alone cannot lead to sustained peace.\n\nHe stated,\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s success does not just depend on its military effectiveness on the battlefield \u2013 it requires improvements to the economy, fiscal transparency, violence free elections, anti-corruption, anti-nepotism efforts, a welcoming business environment for investors, and governance off the battlefield as well.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a comprehensive, all of government response is necessary to build a better future in all parts of this great country.\u201d\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi",
