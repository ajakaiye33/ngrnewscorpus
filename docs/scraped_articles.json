          "title": "Nnamdi Kanu hungry, starving in DSS custody \u2014 Lawyer",
          "text": "Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lawyer of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, on Tuesday, claimed that his client is starving in the custody of the Department of State Services.\n\nAccording to him, none of the pronouncements made by Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja on December 2, 2021, has been obeyed by the DSS.\n\nEjiofor said these in a statement titled: \u201cUpdate on today\u2019s visit to our indefatigable client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu at the Headquarters of the Department of State Services Abuja.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe routine visit to our client \u2014 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was conducted on December 6, 2021, and in his usual practice, he extended his compliments to his millions of supporters. He remains profoundly grateful for the overwhelming support and show of solidarity thus far.\n\n\u201cHowever, we observed with dismay, and indeed very unfortunate and worrisome that notwithstanding the far-reaching orders made by Her Lordship in the open Court on December 2, 2021, the detaining authority being the DSS have in their usual style, flouted and/or ignored the said court orders.\n\n\u201cWe were informed by our client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu that none of the pronouncements made by the Court on December 2 2021 has been obeyed by the DSS.\n\n\u201cThey have unrepentantly continued to treat the orders of the Court with the greatest disdain. Our client \u2014 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu further informed us that he had not eaten anything since yesterday (Sunday).\u201d\n\nThe lawyer further claimed that his client is being punished because he complained to the court about how he is being treated in the custody of the DSS.\n\nEjiofor said, \u201cApparently, he is being punished because we dared to complain to the court about the condition under which he is being held in custody. But, very, unfortunately, this should be the height of their reckless affront to the orders of Court.\n\n\u201cAt the time Her Lordship made these far-reaching orders in open court, I did not mince words in informing the Court that the operatives of the DSS will flout these orders, pursuant to which the court specifically told me to come back to her with these facts if her order is flouted.\u201d\n\nEjiofor noted that due to the development, he would approach the court tomorrow to reveal this \u2018terrifying\u2019 development. The lawyer said that the development is \u2018totally unacceptable, grossly condemnable, and cannot be tolerated.\u2019\n\nHe said, \u201cInterestingly, we will be approaching the court tomorrow with this terrifying development, which is totally unacceptable, grossly condemnable, and cannot be tolerated.\n\n\u201cThe facts must be placed in their proper perspectives: Our Client \u2014 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has not been convicted of committing any crime, he is still presumed innocent of every unfounded and frivolous allegation against him, and as such, the DSS has no power whatsoever to whittle down the enjoyment of any of his rights clearly protected under Chapter 4 of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe detaining authority (DSS) is an agency clearly established by instrumentality of the laws and should operate within the confines of the same laws establishing them, and should not be seen as a lawless entity.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer, hence, demanded that the DSS comply with the ruling of the court immediately as further attempts to flout these orders will be faced with strict sanctions by the court.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe hereby, demand without further ado, for the immediate compliance with all the orders of the Court clearly made on December 2, 2021, and further attempt to flout these orders must be faced with strict sanctions by the Court.\n\n\u201cWe respectfully wish to assure our client\u2019s teeming supporters that we cannot leave anything to chance towards ensuring that our client is sufficiently protected and his rights are upheld. The DSS must and shall certainly operate within the confines of the laws. They have no option on this.\n\n\u201cBe assured that we are not resting on oars whatsoever, to ensure that our Client is unconditionally released. This strategy isn\u2019t being discussed here, but it will happen soon.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The Government facilitated Mortgage Home at Uburu will provide accommodation for 100 households while the park estate will provide accommodation for 130 households.\n\n\u201cThe CBN housing estate at the centenary city will provide accommodation for 110 households. The City Centre estate and the one at the former meat market will jointly provide accommodation for over 200 households\n\n\u201cThe land we allocated to the people at Certinary city, which is affordable for people to own land there that at the long run before we exit the office, we would provide accommodation for 1m Ebonyi people. Currently, Ebonyi has about 3 million population. And by the time we would exit the office in 2023, we would have provided accommodation for about 30 per cent of Ebonyi people.\n\n\u201cMost of all these projects are being done through Private Public Partnership, PPP, .

It takes one week to get a Certificate of Occupancy as this development is facilitating land ownership. Ebonyi has now become a new investment designation in the South East.\n\n\u201cWith the type of security and infrastructure, we develop on a daily basis Estate Developers troop into Ebonyi State to have a share of what we have been able to do here. The benefit of all we are doing, we are appreciated in about 10 years. Abakaliki is no longer a one or two streets composition. We have expanded the frontier; we have expanded the town by about 300 per cent from its former size.\n\n\u201cPeople that have money can subscribe. People under Mortgage can be part of it. Civil servants who subscribe to Federal Mortgage Housing Scheme can be part of it. People can buy from the Estate developers.

          "text": "By Chukwueze Edwin\n\nThe sad death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr has generated widespread reactions over the past week. 12-year old Oromoni Jnr. was a student at Dowen College located in the Lekki area of Lagos state.\n\nThe case has been getting so much attention from the public, there have been so many reactions and numerous claims as to the real cause of death. People who have been reacting are mostly sympathizers, social media users, and family members.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding his death are still shrouded in mystery. The school authorities said in their statement that he died as a result of injuries sustained from playing football. The family of the deceased however said that Sylvester Oromoni Jnr. informed them before his painful passing that he never played football but rather sustained the injuries due to a targeted bullying assault from senior secondary students at his school, Dowen College Lagos.\n\nThe Lagos state government and the police authorities have intervened and vowed to investigate the matter. A statement on Friday by the spokesman of the Ministry of Education, Ganiu Lawal, said the government was in touch with the parents of the boy.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe Lagos State Government sends its condolences to the parents of 12-year-old Sylvester Oromoni Jnr., a student of Dowen College, Lekki. \u201cThe Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, notes that this incident is shocking and the State is indeed sad about this great loss.\n\nThe Lagos State Police Commissioner Hakeem Odumosu, on Saturday, also ordered the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, to take over the investigation of the case immediately.\n\nDelta State government has also said it would investigate the death of Oromoni Jnr. who hails from Warri South LGA in the state.\n\nWhile these are all welcomed developments, one thing however is certain: only an independent autopsy devoid of the different conspiracy theories and their players can ascertain the real cause of death and finally lead everyone to truth and justice for Sylvester Oromoni Jnr. and this must be done with immediate effect.\n\nThe Lagos State government and the Delta state government must come together to ensure that an independent autopsy is carried out, not by the school or the family of the deceased or anyone else but by the government so that the true cause of death can be established and next steps taken even as demands for justice continue to rise.\n\n*Chukwueze Edwin writes from Delta State",

          "text": "The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta has said leveraging the potential of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to automate service delivery should be the next frontier of excellent service delivery to Nigerians by public institutions.\n\nDanbatta made the assertion in a goodwill message presented on his behalf by NCC\u2019s Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, at the opening ceremony of a three-day SERVICOM retreat, which started on December 1, 2021, at the Communications and Digital Economy Complex, Mbora, Abuja.\n\nThe retreat focused on, \u2018Charter Performance Monitoring and Reporting\u2019, which was aimed at monitoring the implementation of the NCC\u2019s Client Service Charter, identifying gaps, measuring and evaluating the progress of service delivery in the Commission.\n\nSERVICOM, an acronym derived from Service Compact With All Nigerians, speaks to a special social contract between the Federal Government through its institutions (Ministries, Department and Agencies) and the Nigerian people that ensures services are delivered in a courteous, prompt and efficient manner.\n\nSpeaking at the event, attended by staff of NCC, Adinde said the NCC has been living up to its expectation as one of the public institutions that have continued to implement the Service Charter with all its various stakeholders. The Director of Public Affairs stated that the digital economy drive of the Federal Government should mean that more services be delivered online to the people of Nigeria and in a more efficient manner in line with the philosophy of SERVICOM.\n\nHe said the NCC is an important partner of SERVICOM in its journey towards service delivery and excellence and invited the participants to recall that fact in the passion and commitment of Prof. Danbatta in ensuring that telecom service providers deliver optimal service to varied categories of stakeholders.\n\n\u201cTherefore, from our perspective as a regulator of the digital ecosystem in Nigeria, we feel that automation of service should be the next stage of service delivery. While we have started this journey with the example of REMITA, which has brought about a lot of efficiency and transparency into the payment remittances by public and Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) of government,\u201d Adinde stated.\n\nOn the implementation of the NCC Charter for SERVICOM, Adinde said the NCC boasts of one of the best and brightest brains that could be found in the public sector as civil servants, who are ingrained with good work ethics and culture. \u201cOur staff are renowned for their warmth and geniality when dealing with internal and external stakeholders. They work as a team on the principle of achieving Specific Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound (SMART) objectives of the Commission,\u201d he said.\n\nAdinde also listed the roles of the Commission is collaborating with other MDAs in various ways, in order to achieve policy objectives of government in many fronts. He also highlighted a number of corporate social responsivity (CSR) projects of the Commission being implemented singly or jointly with other MDAs towards achieving the objective of the government to serve the citizenry better.\n\nAs a further demonstration of the duty NCC owes telecoms consumers, whose interest must be protected in line with Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003, Adinde said NCC created the Consumer Affairs Bureau in September 2001, to ensure consumer protection through policy development and monitoring, advocacy, as well as information and education of all shades of stakeholders.\n\n\u201cConsequently, NCC is one of the few MDAs that has a dedicated toll-free number, designed specifically for the escalation of issues between telecommunications service providers and consumers. We also constantly monitor the Quality of Service (QoS), ensuring that service delivery issues are within the acceptable key performance indicators (KPIs),\u201d Adinde said.\n\nAdinde also listed the roles of the Commission is collaborating with other MDAs in various ways, in order to achieve policy objectives of government in many fronts.

Akajemili also observed that NCC went the extra mile in engaging its stakeholders as well as creating affinity between itself and its stakeholders.\n\nAkajemili stated that she was particularly gratified by NCC\u2019s contribution of 11.94 per cent to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), based on the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report for the third quarter of 2021. However, the SERVICOM Chief Executive beseeched the Commission to sustain and expand on its collaboration with other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) specifically in the area of data management, CSR, Value Added Services (VAS) and shortcodes, to enhance greater synergy among MDAs.\n\nHead, Legislative and Government Relations, NCC and SERVICOM Nodal Officer at the Commission, Bashir Bello, said SERVICOM, as a service delivery initiative, requires everyone to put in his or her best in achieving desired objectives. He emphasized the role of Management\u2019s support, education, and commitment towards improving and consolidating the various SERVICOM interventions that had been initiated.\n\nThe event was attended by SERVICOM Team leads, departmental liaisons officers in the NCC, SERVICOM rapporteurs, and other staff of the Commission.",

          "title": "Omicron: Travel ban on Nigeria discriminatory, prejudiced -FG",
          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has rejected the United Kingdom\u2019s travel ban on Nigerians as well as placing the country on a Red List.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s restrictions on Nigerians came into effect, yesterday after the Omicron variant of COVID-19 was discovered, first in South Africa and later, Nigeria. On Sunday, the British High Commissioner in Nigeria, communicated UK\u2019s decision to include Nigeria on the list, after nine African countries had been placed on the Red List. Britain also suspended visa services to Nigerians; with \u201cvery limited exceptions to travel and entry requirements for critical workers , medical and compassionate cases.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nA waiver was, however, made for citizens who travel from Nigeria but would have to pay \u00a32,285 for a 10-day quarantine.\n\nBut the Federal Government has reiterated that Britain\u2019s decision was discriminatory, punitive, unfair and not based on science and has demanded a review.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope the British government will immediately review the decision to put Nigeria on its red list and rescind it immediately. Nigeria has handled the COVID-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts. Nigeria does not belong on any country\u2019s red lis,\u201d Minister of Information, National Orientation and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAsked why President Muhammadu Buhari did not defer South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s visit to Nigeria, after the Omicron variant was detected in the country, he replied: \u201cAs we speak today, nobody has died from the omicron variant. South Africa had the fortune of having an excellent research centre, which was discovered to have been carried into South Africa, from Botswana, by foreigners\u2026 The Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 considered the visit and decided that, as long as the proper protocol was observed, there was no need to suspend the president\u2019s visit.\u201d\n\nMohammed also disclosed that the PSC would soon take a decision if the UK refuses to review its travel ban and Red list.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s reaction cannot be based on anything but discrimination and prejudice. The truth of the matter is that if the pandemic is not killing as they think it should kill, it\u2019s not a matter of under-reporting. I don\u2019t think these prejudicial predictions of deaths in Africa is based on science.\u201d\n\nThe appropriate response to Britain would be taken by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19. Where is the origin of this variant? It\u2019s definitely not Africa, it\u2019s definitely not Nigeria. Countries in Europe where the same variant has been discovered, they have not been included on the travel ban. Even if 21 cases were discovered, does that qualify us for a travel ban? The ban is unfair, unjust and discriminatory.\n\n\u201c\u2026However, as the spokesman for the Federal Government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by the British government to put Nigeria on the red list just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned. The two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive.\n\n\u201cLet me seize this opportunity to highlight the fact that travel ban, the type that has been slammed on some African countries, is a knee-jerk reaction that can only be detrimental to our quest to most conclusively tackle this pandemic.\n\n\u201c Instead of these reflex responses that are driven by fear, rather than science, why can\u2019t the world take a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, and ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition. \u201c\n\n\u2022Decision taken to protect public health in the UK\n\nHowever, the UK has said the decision cannot be changed.\n\nHead of Communications, British High Commission, Abuja, Dean Hurlock, said the decision was a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe know that this decision will have a significant impact on people in both our countries, particularly at this time of year.\n\n\u201cThis decision is a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK, whilst we try to understand this new variant.These are temporary measures that have been introduced to prevent further Omicron cases from entering the UK, and will be examined at a review point on 20 December.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work very closely with the Nigerian authorities in tackling the pandemic and commend their ongoing work,\u201d Hurlock added.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\n\u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries. Even before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU. Some of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines. This is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called Travel Apartheid.

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF), Abubakar Malami, SAN, said the Virtual Court sitting at the Kuje Correctional Centre, Abuja, is targeted at speedy determination of cases by way of eliminating delays and displacement of denial of justice, which would further support government\u2019s policy of decongestion of correctional centres across the country.\n\nThe minister was quick to clarify that \u201cthis virtual court hearing will not in any way contravene the provision of section 36(6) of the 1999 Constitution, which provides for the arraignment, taking of evidence, tendering of documents, cross-examination and general conduct of criminal proceedings. Inasmuch as these are done in accordance with the said provision, the virtual hearing would be valid.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nMalami further added that the project was initiated to ensure the hearing and determination of urgent and time-bound cases, using the digital platform.\n\nThe AGF spoke, yesterday, at the launch of the virtual court sitting facilities deployed here at the Kuje Correctional Centre, for virtual court sitting proceedings. He explained that the system would equally ensure speedy dispensation of trials in line with section 36(4) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), which provides that every person shall be entitled to fair hearing within a reasonable time.\n\n\u201cIt would also eliminate the issue of difficulties in conveying the inmates to court and would further ensure the safety and security of the inmates and law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cThis initiative will, in no small measure, help boost the economy by ensuring that funds meant for the movement of the inmates would be channeled to other essential areas of needs in the Correctional Centres, and assist the country to meet up with global best practice in terms of the administration of the criminal justice.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Ruaf Aregbesola, who hailed the AGF for the creative initiative, said the project will cut the cost of transportation, the time lost in transit and the often grave risks involved in moving suspects around will be cut altogether.\n\nEarlier, the Controller General Correctional, Halilu Nababa, expressed confidence that the project will enhance speedy access to justice and reposition the correctional service in line with standard global practice.\n\nHe said the target of the project, which is a pilot scheme to be replicated in other facilities nationwide, is to significantly address the perennial challenge of overcrowding in most of our urban facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidential Committee on Correctional Reforms and Decongestion, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Justice, yesterday, effected the release of 15 inmates with minor offences with an option of fine, at the Kuje Correctional Centre, Abuja.\n\nAlready, their fines were paid by the committee and their releases effected.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned.\n\n\u201cThe two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive,\u201d Mohammed fumed.\n\nHe also raised eyebrows against the UK government action, insisting Omicron did not originate in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLet me say straight away that it\u2019s up to the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) to respond to this action by the British government and others, and I have no doubt that the Committee will respond appropriately.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the spokesman for the federal government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by the British government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the British took a decision that was prompted by reflex responses instead of science and taking a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, \u201cas well as ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that such knee-jack reaction of placing a travel ban on Nigeria would be detrimental to the country\u2019s quest to conclusively tackle the pandemic.\n\nThe minister added: \u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries.\n\n\u201cEven before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU. Some of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called \u2018Travel Apartheid.\u2019 Let the world know that no one is safe until everyone is safe\u201d\n\nHe stressed that in the wake of the discovery of Omicron, the PSC, unlike the UK adopted science-driven actions, rather than those based on emotions and other extraneous reasons.\n\nAccording to him, PSC reviewed its International Travel Protocol, which took effect on Sunday, December 5, 2021, aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern.\n\nUnder the revised protocol, passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of and comply with rules including COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure, post-arrival Day 2 COVID-19 PCR test, self-isolation for seven days (for unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated individuals) and day 7 post-arrival exit PCR test (for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals) among others.\n\n\u201cIf any country is not satisfied with them, why not simply subject Nigerians arriving in their country to their own PCR tests and proven conditions, like quarantine, instead of banning them out rightly?\u201d he wondered.\n\nMuhammed expressed hope that the British government would review the decision to ban Nigeria and rescind its decision immediately, saying Nigeria should not be on the red list as it had handled the COVID-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts.\n\nUN Secretary General Rejects \u2018Travel Apartheid\u2019\n\nSpeaking in an interview, Guterres insisted that targeting the most vulnerable nations with travel ban for revealing the existence of the virus that was already present in Europe was unacceptable in a world that has the instruments to ensure safe travel.\n\nGuterres said travel apartheid must be condemned, saying it was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe have the instruments to have safe travels, let us use those instruments to avoid this kind of\u2026 allow me to say, travel apartheid, which I think is unacceptable. What is unacceptable is to have one part of the world that is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world economy condemned to a lockout when they were the ones that revealed the existence of a new variant that, by the way already existed in other parts of the world, including in Europe as we know.\n\n\u201cSo this is a very strong appeal that I launch, an appeal to commonsense that with a virus that is truly borderless travel restrictions that isolate anyone or country or region are not only deeply unfair and punitive they are ineffective.\u201d\n\nIn a move that many have described as rushed, ill-advised and lacking scientific basis added Nigeria to its red list, which contains 11 mostly Southern African countries becomes effective from today.\n\nIn addition, on Monday, the UK government, took further measures against Nigeria as the British High Commission announced that it would pause \u201cmaking decisions\u201d on visitor visa applications from all red list countries, including Nigeria.\n\nLatest figures from the UK government on its website revealed that 21 cases of omicron reported in England were linked to travel from Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to UK kicks against Restriction\n\nOn his part, Isola, in an interview with BBC, described the travel ban as an apartheid in the sense that, \u201cwe are not dealing with an endemic. We are dealing with a pandemic. Whenever we have a challenge there must be collaboration.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigeria\u2019s Minister of Health did come out with a statement yesterday saying between November 22nd and 28th, 67 passengers that tested positive were discovered in Nigeria and many of them happened to be travellers from the UK. But that would not be a basis for Nigeria taking such action against UK.\n\n\u201cThe message is very clear. If there was a mistake, it takes courage of leadership to admit it was an error and not a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the cases of omicron discovered in Nigeria were from in-bound travelers.\n\nAccording to him, a lot of persons would be greatly affected by the action of the UK government, saying, \u201ca lot of people have gone home \u2013 doctors, nurses \u2013 who are working in the UK and providing health services to NHIS and you can imagine the effect, even on Britain. In addition, we are talking of the anger of 200 million people. This decision is going to hamper our relationship with UK, which is why I am not happy about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs at today, this variant is classified as a mild one and there has not been any hospitalisation nor death, scientist still working on it. This is quite different from the Delta variant and decision must be based on scientific and empirical evidence.\n\n\u201cWe must have the facts that the variant we are talking about is dangerous. And that is why we need collaboration all over the world to ascertain the nature of the variant,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UK, at the weekend, had updated its so called Red List, indicating countries prohibited from entering the UK in view of the new COVID-19 variant called \u201comicron\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking with Arise News Channel yesterday, Ishola revealed that Nigeria would this week begin high level discussions with UK, in its efforts to seek a quick and amicable resolution to the restriction of Nigerians from visiting the country.\n\nHe said this week, Nigeria would begin talks with the British government, but quickly added that he was not willing to pre-empt what the country would do if its request to be delisted from the list was ignored.\n\nHe opined that under normal circumstances, the world should have saluted the efforts of the South African Medical Association for alerting everyone to the Omicron variant and rally round to solve the problem rather than the discriminatory action.\n\nThe high commissioner maintained South Africa had confirmed that the variant does not involve any hospitalisation or death, stressing that the issue of slamming bans on account of a \u201cmild variant\u201d was not the right thing to do.\n\nWhile stating that the coronavirus did not originate from Africa, he noted that the leaders of the continent were doing everything to ensure that the vaccines come to Africa but that what comes to Africa has been very limited.\n\nAccording to the envoy, Nigeria has handled the COVID-19 pandemic excellently and should be commended , reason the travel restrictions this time is causing an outrage.\n\nWhile insisting that the UK\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t backed by scientific evidence, he said: \u201cSo, this is not acceptable. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making it very clear. There is no scientific evidence as of today that shows that this variant is deadlier.\u201d\n\nHe narrated that Nigerians were already reacting to the travel ban in their different ways, recalling that on a on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Lagos earlier in the day, only 24 people were on board which was a form of subtle protest because an average Nigerian does not believe that the country deserves the shabby treatment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure many of them will not subject themselves to such (conditions). The travel ban came Saturday night. Today is the first working day and I can assure you that before the end of the week, we will engage with the host authorities,\u201d he assured.\n\nHe mentioned that with a relationship that dates back more than a century, both countries be deepening their ties rather than taking actions that will taint the relationship.\n\n\u201cThe ties between Nigeria and Britain date back to more than one century. This relationship is not where it should be. And we\u2019re just making efforts to deepen the relationship before this ban came up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to think that there won\u2019t be a reconsideration of the decision. We\u2019ll have to dialogue at the end of the day to have a compromise on this issue,\u201d the envoy added.\n\nStating that the matter has its economic and political dimensions, he expressed that hope that the British government will reverse the decision as it does not make much sense to ban a country with three cases where\u2019s those with tens of cases were not listed.\n\nStakeholders, Travellers Condemn UK\u2019s Decision to Put Nigeria on Red list\n\nIn a related development, aviation industry stakeholders and air travellers have condemned the decision of UK to put Nigeria on its redlist.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, the Chief Operating Officer of Dana Air, Mr. Obi Mbanuzuo, described the decision of UK as a knee-jerk reaction, saying the UK was aware that the omicron was already in Europe even before South Africa announced it to the world, but failed to take action.\n\n\u201cThis is a knee jerk reaction which will be soon reversed once they realise that Omicron is already deeply embedded in UK. They can\u2019t keep omicron put by banning Nigerians. What of the Netherlands where we now know had omicron even before the South Africans announced it?\u201d Mbanuzuo said.\n\nAlso, the Managing Director of Flight and Logistics Solutions Limited, Mr. Amos Akpan, said the UK government\u2019s decision was not backed by scientific data.\n\n\u201cThe data in public domain shows higher number of infected persons found in UK, while the official data says only three cases found in Nigeria. The Omicron variant existed in Spain and a few European countries before a South African scientist pronounced its existence.\n\n\u201cThe strict restrictions on Nigerians and other Africans are scientifically unjustified. Therefore, we are left to view it as a kneejerk political reaction. If they stop Nigerians from entry into UK, will they also stop Spanish, Germans, Italians, and Indonesians, who have higher number of infections of the Omicron variant?\n\n\u201cPlaying politics with medical science to this extent smacks of apartheid and racism and will not stop further mutation and spread of the virus. The season for this kneejerk reaction is bad for air travel and tourism business for UK, and for Nigeria. British Airways, Virgin Atlantic Airways will feel the impact,\u201d Akpan added.\n\nIn his contribution, the President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye condemned the decision of the UK to put Nigeria in the red list and said it was totally uncalled for.\n\nShe disclosed that a lot of Nigerians and students in the UK who wanted to come to Nigeria have since cancelled their travel plans, regretting that the action taken by the UK could discourage vaccination.\n\n\u201cThe decision taken by the UK by putting Nigeria on the red list is affecting our business. Many people have cancelled their flights. You know, the UK is second home to many Nigerians. A lot of people are cancelling their travel plans because they know if they come to Nigeria they will be made to pay over 2000 pounds and they said they would only review this by December 20, 2021.\n\n\u201cThey will review it but it is totally uncalled for. That action will discourage vaccination. After all, Delta variant of COVID-19 appeared in the UK in February this year but there was no overreaction like this. This is making people not to go for the vaccine. It is unlike the US, which is saying that it is only fully vaccinated people that can come,\u201d she said.\n\nTravel expert and the organiser of Akwaaba African Travel Market, Ikechi Ukoh told THISDAY that it was disappointing that the UK could put Nigeria on the red list as the two countries have very close relationship and there is nothing Nigeria has done that the UK was not involved.\n\nSpeaking in similar vein, industry consultant and the CEO of Belujane Konsult, Chris Aligbe said that as a country, the UK took the decision to protect its citizens, even though he pointed out that such a decision was hasty.\n\nHowever, the Regional Airport Manager, South West in charge of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Terminal, Lagos, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba, told THISDAY that the UK carriers, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operated their flights from Lagos on Monday but the only difference was that BA had shifted its flights from night to morning.\n\nShe said that there was no indication yet that other international carriers have received any directive from their host countries, adding that airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and others operated their normal flights from Lagos.\n\nThe Secretary General of Aviation Round Table, a think-tank group in the industry, Group Captain John Ojikutu (retd), told THISDAY that considering the long, good relations Nigeria has with the UK, putting Nigeria on red list was condemnable.\n\nHe said that diplomatic relations was guided by the principle of reciprocity, noting that Nigeria could ban UK nationals but not British Carriers, as UK did not ban Nigerian carriers, but Nigerian citizens.\n\nOjikutu added: \u201cWhat economic sense would it make for BA to be coming to Nigeria under its COVID-19 rules when 90 per cent of its inbound and outbound passengers are Nigerians?\u201d\n\nNARD: Omicron Not as Deadly to Warrant Flight Restrictions\n\nHowever, the National Association Resident Doctors (NARD) has said studies were yet to be concluded on the virulent nature of the Omicron variant, saying based on what is known currently, the virus strain was yet to claim many lives to warrant rush to impose travel ban.\n\nNARD also urged the federal government to take proper measures to protect Nigerians and check further spread of Omicron variant as well as any other infectious diseases.\n\nSpeaking in a telephone interview with THISDAY, the President of NARD, Dr. Dare Godiya Ishaya said there was no need for panic.\n\nWhen asked if the Omicron variant was not a serious health threat to humanity, Ishaya said: \u201cWell, from a scientific point of view, it\u2019s difficult to say because this variant of COVID-19 is only being studied and we don\u2019t know for sure, how virulent it is. However, with what is known, the variant hasn\u2019t claimed any lives yet, it may be a milder form than the existing variants hence these bans may be a storm in a teacup.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, countries have the responsibility of protecting their people and if the UK authorities feel this ban will help their people, we can\u2019t question that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left for us also to take measures that will protect Nigerians from COVID-19 and other diseases.\u201d\n\nCACOVID Urges Nigerians to Get Vaccinated\n\nThe Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) also appealed to Nigerians not to let their guard down in the fight against the virulent virus.\n\nCACOVID which is a coalition of private sector operators, mostly financial institutions and the Central Bank of Nigeria, urged Nigerians to ensure they make themselves available to take the vaccines and also adhere to all COVID-19 protocols.\n\n\u201cThe organisation also appealed to those who are yet to take their second dose of the vaccine to do so in order to be fully immunised against the virus.\n\n\u201cCACOVID continues to support the NCDC in its cause to eradicate COVID-19 in all spheres of the country through the dissemination of helpful communication materials that\u2019ll sensitise Nigerians against the virus as well as provision of equipment crucial to the fight. Support the cause, do your part, get vaccinated today,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the group, just when it seemed like a semblance of normalcy was returning to the world after a grueling battle with COVID-19, yet another variant of the virus simply known as Omicron reared its head.\n\n\u201cThe variant which was first identified by scientists in South Africa on November 24, 2021, has been labelled a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d (VOC) by the World Health Organisation. While further epidemiological studies are currently underway to better understand the virus, current findings have revealed that Omicron has several mutations that may greatly impact its spread and the severity of illness it causes.\n\n\u201cThe strain has been detected in at least 20 countries, including Belgium, Hong Kong, Israel, Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom and very recently,\n\n\u201cNigeria as reported by the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC). In its report, the organisation elaborated that the cases were recent arrivals in the country with a history of travel to South Africa in the past week. It stated that follow up to ensure isolation, linkage to clinical care, contact tracing and other relevant response activities have commenced.\n\n\u201cSince the news of the outbreak, many countries, Nigeria inclusive, have reacted swiftly by placing a raft of travel restrictions and protocols. For all inbound travellers to Nigeria, it is mandatory to present a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48 hours before departure,\u201d it added.\n\nBiden\u2019s Medical Adviser Urges Nigerians to Take Booster Jabs\n\nThis is just as yesterday, the Chief Medical Adviser to United States President, Dr. Anthony Facci, who in a virtual presentation addressed stakeholders at the National COVID-19 Summit held at the National Intelligence Agency, Abuja, canvassed for the use of booster doses in Nigeria to provide extra layer of protection against COVID-19.\n\nContinuing, Facci, who is the Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, said statistics showed that 95 -96 per cent of vaccinated people, who received boosters got better than those not boosted.\n\nHe called on the US to partner with Nigeria to ensure that more people are vaccinated as much as possible.\n\nFacci, who said it was a great honour to address the National COVID-19 Summit, decried the low number of persons who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in Nigeria compared with that of the US.\n\nAccording to him while the percentage of fully and partially vaccinated persons in the US was 69 per cent, the percentage of fully and partially vaccinated persons in Nigeria was still as low as 2.9 per cent.\n\nThe US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard also underlined the strength of the partnership between the United States and Nigeria in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nWhile urging Nigerians to take COVID-19 vaccines, she said the US government has contributed more than $130 million towards fighting the pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking at the summit, the Chairman Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, Mr. Boss Mustapha said the pandemic had become the most significant public health emergency in the world with the WHO estimates putting the number of fatalities at about five million.\n\nHe put the number medical personnel trained on infection, prevention and control at 40,000, while the total number of samples tested to date was 3,580,510 of which 214,662 persons were confirmed cases.\n\nMustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation said 2,980 deaths attributed to COVID-19 were recorded in Nigeria.\n\nHe said Nigeria had experienced the third wave while a fourth wave was unfolding with the Omicron variant.\n\nHe said with the best of efforts, the country, had so far been able to access 12 million doses of vaccines going into the third phase of the vaccines roll out while more is expected to be available by the end of February 2022.\n\nCurrently, according to him, 3,775,500, or 3.4 per cent of target population was fully vaccinated with second dose while 7,080,878, or 6.3 per cent of targeted eligible population had been partially vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the omicron variant of concern highlights how fragile and vulnerable we are globally. It is therefore important that we maintain pressure on the COVID-19 virus until we deny it the opportunity to continue to circulate and mutate.\n\n\u201cOur overall focus will be to scale up vaccination of our population to reach targets set by the WHO. Nigeria needs to continue to implement public health and social measures in place combined with effective vaccination now that we are getting the vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, lamented that with the emergence of Omicron, Nigeria, like some other countries have become targets of restrictive measures.\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan has lashed the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire; the Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunimbe Mamora, and the Permanent Secretary, Mahmuda Mamman, for not attending the summit.\n\nLawan, who declared open the summit, said the two ministers and the Permanent Secretary ought to be physically present at the summit to garner all the sources that will come out of the event.\n\nHe said their presence was vital as the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, was an interventionist outfit.\n\nEven though Ehanire was briefly sighted at the summit, Lawan insisted another senior official should have replaced him to demonstrate the seriousness of the event.\n\n\u201cBefore I begin my remarks, is the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Health here? Well, I asked that question because the two ministers of health are not here. The Minister of Health, the Minister of State and the permanent secretary are not here. I believe this is not good.\n\nBecause everything we do here, the federal Ministry of Health is supposed to be here to garner all the resources that will come out of this. The PSC is simply an interventionist outfit. And as politicians and political leaders, we are supposed to be very serious and committed about the health of our people,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nHe assured that whatever is needed to fight COVID-19 will be provided in the 2022 budget that will be passed by the Senate.\n\nThe Senate President called for a continuous multisectoral approach that integrates multiple work plan and collaboration to establish a sustainable bio security framework for the country, noting that recent experience has also shown that outbreak of diseases affects not only the health sector but also the social \u2013 economic sector of the nation.\n\nAlso, a professor of virology, Oyewale Tomori, in a paper titled: \u201cGlobal Health Security Threat: Repositioning to End the Pandemic and Build Back Better,\u201d cited corruption, lack of patriotism, self-interest and shameless as the main destroyer of the country.\n\n\u201cOver the last 60 years, these diseases, all affecting our culture, have become the combined endemic demolisher of the foundation of our individual health security which has shaken the foundation of our national health security and in turn determined our irrelevance as a nation in contributing meaningfully to global health security.\n\n\u201cToday, we lie to each other. The government lies to us, and we reciprocate with bigger lies, telling the government it is doing well, when we know it is not. We clap with the loudest ovation for a non- performing leader. We acclaim in pretended joyous ecstasy, those we should not, even when we know they are not telling the truth. We pray that our king lives forever, and he says amen, when we both know we shall all die,\u201d Tomori added.\n\nThe virologist also said he was disappointed to learn that there was Omicron in Nigeria from outside, based on the report issued by Canadian authorities.\n\nHe said: \u201cI woke up today to hear the Canada no longer recognises my genuine vaccination card. And Britain has clamped a travel ban on us. A few days ago, I had to know there was Omicron in Nigeria from outside.\n\n\u201cThe same Canada was telling me that Nigerians who travelled out with negative COVID lab result were Omicronised, before my own CDC finally tells me that we had the variant, detected in samples collected from people recently travelled from South Africa\u2026.were they people on the entourage of President Ramaphosa. They did not tell.\n\n\u201cWe painfully call the reactions of the UK and Canada, racism, inequity. But I say we are paying for condoning our errors of commission and overlooking our errors of omission,\u201d he argued.\n\nRegarding the production of vaccines locally, the one-time President of Nigeria Academy of Sciences (NAS) said the current generation of Nigerians are much smarter than the older generation, adding that if given the enabling opportunity and environment Nigeria will be donating vaccines to poor countries.\n\n\u201cThe first epidemic we must address is the one affecting our culture. We must have a nation where national interest buries self-interest. Otherwise, this summit will become a mirage and a vapour, it will be burnt to ashes by the fire of evil that plagues us. Unless we build back better on our culture, the outcome of the summit will descend into the valley of the disregarded and disremembered, and become another expensive exercise in futility,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Omoigui-Okauru harps on need to reduce physical cash transactions\n\n\u2022FG\u2019s governance app 90% ready, says Agba\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, yesterday said the agency would henceforth ensure that all government revenues are included in the accounting for taxes generated and amounts invested by taxpayers in road infrastructure as a result of Executive Order 007 and tax waivers granted pioneer companies.\n\nHe also said import and exercise duties waived through the operations of the Nigeria Customs Service and all other revenues generated by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) on behalf of the federal, state and local governments in the country would also be taken into consideration.\n\nNami, said the measures, when implemented would align the country with global best practice in reporting public finance and reflect a more transparent and accurate picture of the country\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio which is currently at six per cent.\n\nThis was just as a former FIRS Executive Chairman, Mrs. Ifueko Omoigui-Okauru, lamented that physical cash constituted the bulk of transactions in the country, calling on the government to further deepen electronic transactions for the sake of transparency in fiscal operations.\n\nAlso, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, said the current administration accords great premium on citizens\u2019 participation in governance, tracking service delivery and development in their communities.\n\nTo this end, Agba pointed out that in order to ensure transparency and accountability in the delivery of government\u2019s capital projects countrywide, the budget and national planning arm of the ministry was working on a Web App \u2013called the Eye Mark, to assist citizens to report on government\u2019s projects and programmes earmarked for their communities using their mobile phones and in real time.\n\nThey all spoke at the opening of the national symposium on, \u201cTaxation and Challenges of External Shocks: Lessons and Policy Options for Nigeria,\u201d as well as formal launch of the FIRS Contact Center in Abuja.\n\nThe FIRS boss explained that for the country to achieve meaningful and sustainable growth in tax revenue, and minimise dependence on oil revenue, there was the need for continuous reform of the country\u2019s operations and processes and human capital development, adoption of technology as well as the tax laws.\n\nNami also said Nigeria\u2019s low tax-to-GDP ratio constituted one of the recurring issues in national discourse, adding that though the country needed to continually and conscientiously put measures in place to improve such concern, it also required to comprehensively bring all the national and sub-national revenue sources into consideration to properly and appropriately determine the correct and meaningful tax-to-GDP ratio for the country. He pointed out that the current basis for tax to GDP computation, which mostly focuses on the taxes administered at the federal level and leaving out other sources of revenue being generated by the federal, states and local governments and their MDAs, does not truly reflect its correct standing.\n\nHe said reforms remained crucial to the current Board and Management of FIRS, adding that the, \u201cachievements we have recorded in improving and sustaining the revenue growth since 2020 to date irrespective of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed to these reform initiatives.\u201d\n\nHe stressed the need to strengthen collaboration among the tiers of government to enhance the certainty of the tax system and engender taxpayer confidence and compliance, stressing that the service would continue to provide leadership to the states through the Joint Tax Board (JTB) to re-position tax administration in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further, the FIRS boss said as a key stakeholder in the symposium, the agency would consider the ideas and strategies recommended at and incorporate them in its corporate plan from 2022 and beyond.\n\nAccording to him, the essence of the symposium cannot be over-emphasised given the challenges being experienced globally due to the pandemic, expressing concern that the mutations and vaccine resistant variants being discovered every often in some countries, further indicated there is no respite yet as social and economic variables are still unpredictable.\n\nHe said the thematic areas for the symposium were carefully chosen to evaluate the reform options in tax administration and the lessons tax administrators could learn from other success stories as well as review the challenges of the informal sector which constitutes about 70 per cent of businesses in the country.\n\nThe symposium, organised in collaboration with the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS), also sought to assess the reform options available to bring the SMEs into the tax net.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnother area of consideration will be policy options to get the private sector involved in the critical infrastructure development in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the launch of the contact centre demonstrated the FIRS commitment to not only hold talks on policy options in enhancing tax administration but also putting in place structures to actualise one of its key policy thrusts, which is to build a customer-centric FIRS through effective and efficient taxpayer service.\n\nHe explained that the centre was designed to help in bridging the communication gap between the taxpayers and the service and provide real-time platform for response to issues and resolution of challenges and concerns that may be raised by the resident and non-resident taxpayers without physically visiting our offices.\n\nAgba, at the symposium, said the current administration accords great premium on citizens\u2019 participation in governance, tracking service delivery and development in their communities.\n\nHe said in order to ensure transparency and accountability in the delivery of government\u2019s capital projects countrywide, the budget and national planning arm of the ministry was working on a Web App \u2013called the Eye Mark, to assist citizens to report on government\u2019s projects and programmes earmarked for their communities using their mobile phones and in real time.\n\nHe said the application would soon be launched as it is about 90 per cent developed, stating that the government required the active participation in the process of tying budget provisions to projects and getting time value of money earmarked for capital projects as governance remained a collective responsibility by all citizens.\n\nAgba, said the ministry would continue to support the FIRS and provide the enabling environment and policy direction to strengthen its operations.\n\nThe minister said taxation remained the surest and most sustainable source of government revenue and a potent tool for economic growth adding that that the federal government had continued to review its tax policy to bring it in line with current realities.\n\nHe said the fiscal initiatives in the annual Finance Act, prioritize non-oil sectors such as primary agriculture production, shipping and air transport, as well as financial and insurance services and grants tax breaks for MSMEs as well as enshrines fiscal discipline in Government Owned Enterprises (GOE) by limiting their cost- to-revenue ratio to a maximum of 50 per cent.\n\nAgba, further pointed out that due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of oil prices in the international market, the government had continually placed a premium on the growth of the non-oil sector in the diversification of revenue sources.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am glad to note that the FIRS non-oil tax collections for 2020 and the collections so far for 2021 is higher than the tax from oil. This can be attributed to the various reform programmes and digitization projects being undertaken by the Service to improve its operations. More is needed considering that we need to harness all sources in closing the budget deficit and reducing government borrowing.\u201d\n\nThe minister, therefore, urged the FIRS to be consistent and focused in ensuring that current reforms are sustained.\n\nOmoigui-Okauru, who was the guest speaker at the symposium, said cutting down on physical cash transaction would help track financial transactions for the purposes for effective taxation in the country.\n\nShe further stressed the need for the country to strengthen its fiscal buffers by building a resilient economy to withstand and overcome external vulnerabilities.\n\nShe said as long as public health challenges persist, external shocks had become inevitable, and called for adequate preparations on the part of government to contain it whenever it occurs.\n\nOmoigui-Okauru, stressed the need to diversify the revenue base and build a resilient system, pointing out that the states could not afford to continue to depend on federal allocations for survival, stressing that dialogue was required in addressing the question over who collects tax revenues.\n\nAmong other things, she noted that the increasing insecurity and manpower gaps had limited tax yields in recent times adding that the development of a robust economy should be accorded every sense of urgency it requires.\n\nThe former FIRS boss, also called for integrated tax system and real stakeholder engagement as well as home-grown solutions to enhancing domestic non-oil revenue collections.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria better off together\n\nSylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nA former Minister of Information and Culture, Professor Jerry Gana, has described the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to implement the 2014 National Conference report \u201cas a terrible mistake\u201d.\n\nGana, who said the non-implementation of the confab report was largely responsible for some of the growing agitations and disunity across the country, however, said Nigerians were better off together as a people and country.\n\nGana, who spoke on Sunday in Uvwiamuge, Agbarho, Delta State, during the thanksgiving service to conclude activities marking the 90th anniversary of the Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) Worldwide, said there would hardly be peace in the absence of justice and fairness in any society.\n\nThe elder statesman, however, maintained that, he did not share sentiments of persons, who were clamouring for the balkanisation of the country, saying he believed strongly in a united Nigeria, where justice and fairness were served to everyone irrespective of political or religious inclinations.\n\n\u201cWe, in the middlebelt of Nigeria, are great lovers of peace, justice and fairness. The last administration convened a national conference in 2014 and we agreed on some certain fundamentals to ensure justice and fairness. Unfortunately, when this government came in, they made a terrible mistake. They never touched that report and that is the problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are now saying we should start that conversation. We should talk to one another and assure one another of justice and fairness, because without equity, there can\u2019t be peace. Without equity, we cannot be together. Let me appeal to the federal government to promote peace, equity and justice. Let me also appeal to those people, who are agitating that there\u2019s tremendous power in being united. Let\u2019s not fight to scatter and divide Nigeria. We are better being together,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe congratulated the Urhobo Nation on the 90th anniversary of UPU, stressing that Urhobo people had played prominent roles in stabilising and promoting the unity of Nigeria.\n\nThe former minister, had at an earlier engagement, said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would be swept out of office in 2023, because it had committed a lot of injustices against humanity, adding that Nigerians were fed up with their leaders.\n\nGana said this at the weekend in Effurun, near Warri, Delta State, while delivering a lecture titled: \u201cRaising 21st Century Leaders for Nigeria\u201d at Youth Arise Conference 2021.\n\nThe Youth Arise Nigeria Conference with large turnout in attendance from within and Outside Delta was put together by Advocates of Paradigm Shift in Governance.\n\nThey included Deacon Chris Iyowaye, Hon. Gibson Akporehe, Phillip Adu-Odogwu, Cogent Owhe and Lady E Ejiro Umukoro with the goal of raising the civic and political consciousness of youths in how they engage governance, get their PVC as a civic duty while volunteering and investing their time in being useful citizens rather than be purchaseable electorate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

That none of Atiku\u2019s parents or grandparents was born in Nigeria and his father died a citizen of Northern Cameroon in 1957 prior to the referendum of June 1, 1961 that made Northern Cameroon a part of Nigeria.\n\nIn urging the court to dismiss the suit with substantial cost, Atiku and his party said the plaintiff, which lacks the locus standi (legal right) to institute the action, has failed to prove that Atiku is not a citizen of Nigeria.\n\nEyitayo Jegede (SAN), representing Atiku in a preliminary objection to the suit, said the plaintiff\u2019s case was statute barred, having been brought 129 days after the act complained of, which borders on the nomination and eligibility of Atiku as a candidate of the PDP in the 2019 general election, while the primary election which the former vice-president emerged was conducted on the 6th of October, 2018, contrary to election 285(9) of the constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe suit was filed on February 11, 2019 and ought to be heard and determined within 180 days as provided by Section 285(10) of the 1999 constitution (as amended) by the 4th Alteration No.21 Act, 2017.\u201d\n\nOther defendants in the matter aligned with the submissions of the counsel to Atiku in urging the court to dismiss the suit of the plaintiffs.\n\nIn his submissions, Akinola Oladimeji from the chambers of Kayode Ajulo, urged the court to dismiss the preliminary objections by the defendants, adding that the plaintiff has deposed to an affidavit to the effect that Atiku is not a citizen of Nigeria.\n\nHe said the argument canvassed by Atiku and his party are of no moment and should be dismissed as misconceived and lacking in merit, adding also that the plaintiff has the locus standi to file the action, having shown sufficient and established a threat of injury he would suffer.\n\nAfter listening to the submissions of all lawyers in the suit, Justice Ekwo then adjourned till February 21, 2022 to deliver judgment.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "BREAKING: Broke Nigerian Government Owes Police Officers Nationwide Amid Insecurity As Personnel Lament Non-payment Of November Salaries",
          "text": "Some police personnel have cried out over the non-payment of their November salary, saying the situation has worsened their economic plight.\n\nThe officers who spoke to SaharaReporters on Tuesday, December 7, on condition of anonymity, said that unlike their colleagues from other security agencies, they have been resuming at their respective duty posts without pay.\n\nFile Photo\n\n\u201cToday is 7th and no policeman has been paid salary. How on earth will policeman not take bribe when the peanuts they get as salaries don't even come on time.Any government that don't take the welfare of its security personnels seriously has lost the way. Yet they government wants a better and active police force. Funny enough, every other security agencies has been paid,\u201d one of the officers told SaharaReporters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba has confirmed the development.\n\nAccording to a police wireless message with reference number CV:3940/PB/FHQ/ABJ/VOL45/8 DTO: 031350/12/2021 obtained by SaharaReporters, the IGP said the issue is being treated appropriately.\n\n\u201cPAYMENT OF NOVEMBER 2021 SALARY X INFORMATION RECEIVED MINE FROM IPPIS UNIT OF OAGF X INDICATES DELAY IN PROCESSING OF FUNDS FROM FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE FOR PAYMENT OF NOVEMBER 2021 SALARIES X WHICH IMPLIES THAT THERE WILL BE DELAY IN PAYMENT OF NOVEMBER 2021 SALARY X HOWEVER X INGENPOL APPRECIATES THE SACRIFICES AND DEDICATION OF PERSONNEL OF THE FORCE X HE IS THEREFORE MAKING FRANTIC EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE DELAY IS MINIMIZED.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria is broke and has been borrowing to fund its budgets and relying on loans to pay salaries.\n\nFor example, Minister of Labour and Employment, Mr Chris Ngige, while doctors were on strike over poor allowance, had in September 2021 confirmed that the Nigerian government under President Muhammadu Buhari borrowed funds from international sources to pay salaries of workers because of a shortfall in the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nNgige had said the government took borrowed funds from foreign institutions like the World Bank to offset some recurrent expenditures.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had in April 2021 admitted that Nigeria\u2019s economy was facing a difficult time, saying borrowing was inevitable.\n\nShe had said, \u201cWe have very low revenues, we have very high expenditures. What we have done so far is just to provide some stability to make sure salaries are paid, pensions are received every month; that we send funds to the judiciary and the legislature; that we meet our debt service obligations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are doing. It also means we have had to borrow more than we had planned before the COVID-19 started because we need to still continue to invest in infrastructure using our national budget. We borrowed to invest in key projects such as roads, rail, airports, seaports and several other investments that are required in health and in education and upgrading the social standards and quality of life of our people and Nigeria is not unique as several countries of the world went into recession.\n\n\u201cAlmost every other country has had to borrow more than it planned.

          "title": "BREAKING: Broke Nigerian Government Owes Police Officers Nationwide Amid Insecurity As Personnel Lament Non-payment Of November Salaries",
          "text": "Some police personnel have cried out over the non-payment of their November salary, saying the situation has worsened their economic plight.\n\nThe officers who spoke to SaharaReporters on Tuesday, December 7, on condition of anonymity, said that unlike their colleagues from other security agencies, they have been resuming at their respective duty posts without pay.\n\nFile Photo\n\n\u201cToday is 7th and no policeman has been paid salary. How on earth will policeman not take bribe when the peanuts they get as salaries don't even come on time.Any government that don't take the welfare of its security personnels seriously has lost the way. Yet they government wants a better and active police force. Funny enough, every other security agencies has been paid,\u201d one of the officers told SaharaReporters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba has confirmed the development.\n\nAccording to a police wireless message with reference number CV:3940/PB/FHQ/ABJ/VOL45/8 DTO: 031350/12/2021 obtained by SaharaReporters, the IGP said the issue is being treated appropriately.\n\n\u201cPAYMENT OF NOVEMBER 2021 SALARY X INFORMATION RECEIVED MINE FROM IPPIS UNIT OF OAGF X INDICATES DELAY IN PROCESSING OF FUNDS FROM FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE FOR PAYMENT OF NOVEMBER 2021 SALARIES X WHICH IMPLIES THAT THERE WILL BE DELAY IN PAYMENT OF NOVEMBER 2021 SALARY X HOWEVER X INGENPOL APPRECIATES THE SACRIFICES AND DEDICATION OF PERSONNEL OF THE FORCE X HE IS THEREFORE MAKING FRANTIC EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE DELAY IS MINIMIZED.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria is broke and has been borrowing to fund its budgets and relying on loans to pay salaries.\n\nFor example, Minister of Labour and Employment, Mr Chris Ngige, while doctors were on strike over poor allowance, had in September 2021 confirmed that the Nigerian government under President Muhammadu Buhari borrowed funds from international sources to pay salaries of workers because of a shortfall in the country\u2019s revenue.\n\nNgige had said the government took borrowed funds from foreign institutions like the World Bank to offset some recurrent expenditures.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had in April 2021 admitted that Nigeria\u2019s economy was facing a difficult time, saying borrowing was inevitable.\n\nShe had said, \u201cWe have very low revenues, we have very high expenditures. What we have done so far is just to provide some stability to make sure salaries are paid, pensions are received every month; that we send funds to the judiciary and the legislature; that we meet our debt service obligations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are doing. It also means we have had to borrow more than we had planned before the COVID-19 started because we need to still continue to invest in infrastructure using our national budget. We borrowed to invest in key projects such as roads, rail, airports, seaports and several other investments that are required in health and in education and upgrading the social standards and quality of life of our people and Nigeria is not unique as several countries of the world went into recession.\n\n\u201cAlmost every other country has had to borrow more than it planned. It means we expanded our deficit very fast in 2020. 2021 is a year that we see as the year of recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, FAAC reduces and whenever FAAC reduces, it is a very difficult situation and in the past one year, we have tried to fall back on some specific accounts that are meant to be saved; savings that when you have such a situation, you fall back on the resources and augment.\n\n\u201cSo, we take funds based on Mr President\u2019s approval either from Excess Crude or Stabilisation Account or in some cases, President approved for us to take funds from LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) dividends. In the month of March, we had a shortfall of FAAC that was about N50 billion; we didn\u2019t have enough accrued in any of those accounts other than some N8.5 billion that we took from the exchange rate differential account so we added that and we ended up with the FAAC of N605 billion.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s dwindling finances had also come under intense pressure as the Muhammadu Buhari-led government has been amassing foreign loans.\n\nThe country\u2019s debt profile according to the Debt Management Office was N33.10 trillion as of the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThis represents an increase of N191 billion compared to the N32.91 trillion recorded in December 2020.\n\nThe DMO in a statement had said the debt figures include the debt stock of the federal and state governments, as well as the Federal Capital Territory.",

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Funke Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies.

          "title": "Earnipay is improving financial well-being for salaried employees",
          "text": "In Nigeria, wages for formal-sector employees are paid monthly; in the informal sector, however, this is paid daily. Now, when salaried employees go broke between paydays, they have three options: borrow, take a loan, or request a salary advance. But loans, most times, come with exploitative interest rates and salary advance schemes could plunge an employee deeper into debt.\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution, founded by Nonso Onwuzulike, allows employees flexible access to their accrued salaries on any day of the month.\n\nRevising the payday cycle\n\nIn 2019, Onwuzulike started a recycling company in Accra, Ghana, to reduce plastic waste and enable plastic recycling in the capital city. While running the business, he hired waste collectors and placed them on a monthly payment schedule. However, these employees\u2014all of them coming from informal-sector backgrounds\u2014were unhappy about this. They were used to being paid after a job was completed, or at the end of the workday. The monthly payment cycle left them cash-strapped and unable to match their daily expenses to their income. Consequently, once salaries were paid at the end of the month, many of the workers quit the company in search of other employment.\n\nEager to stem the high attrition rate among the waste collection staff, the company switched from a monthly payment schedule to a flexible one, allowing the workers to be paid more frequently\u2014weekly or bi-weekly. The change increased their productivity and fewer workers jumped ship.\n\nIt was a light-bulb moment for Onwuzulike. He went on to survey 100 formal employees within his network to find out how often they ran out of cash before payday and what their employers did to alleviate their financial difficulties.\n\nOnwuzulike\u2019s original intention for Earnipay was to build a salary advance solution\u2014in keeping with similar solutions already in existence in Nigeria, some of them powered by traditional banks. But plans changed when the results of the 100-person survey showed that 90% of salaried employees would rather have flexible access to their accrued salaries.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need payday loans or salary advances to fund their lives; they just wish to be paid more frequently,\u201d Onwuzulike said on a call with TechCabal.\n\nEarnipay is currently in beta, with Onwuzulike serving as CEO, Busayo Oyetunji COO, and Joshua Ajayi CTO. As Onwuzulike tells TechCabal, all three of them consider themselves co-builders of the product.\n\n\u201cWorks like an ATM\u201d\n\nEarnipay is unavailable to individual employees, so employers need to sign up and onboard their staff. The Earnipay app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month. Earnipay funds the withdrawal.\n\nFor example, if one dips into their salary on the ninth day of the month, it means they\u2019re entitled to half the amount they\u2019ve earned for working nine days. At the end of the month, their employer deducts from their salary the amount withdrawn, uses it to refund Earnipay for initially funding that withdrawal, then pays the employee the balance as their salary for the month.\n\nTransaction-fee tiers are attached to withdrawals. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 attracts a fee of \u20a6500, and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 attracts a \u20a61,000 fee.\n\n\u201cIt works just like an ATM,\u201d Oyetunji said.\n\nIntersecting the formal and informal workforce\n\nThe informal sector makes up about 80.8% of the workforce in urban Africa. In Nigeria where Earnipay operates out of, the sector makes up over 70% of the workforce.\n\nWhen Earnipay piloted three months ago, Onwuzulike envisaged that the solution would be useful only for low-income staff and informal employees, but the income profile of the app\u2019s users vary, Onwuzulike claims. \u201cOne of our customers earns a million naira a month,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, 17 companies have signed onto the app as active users and their employees have used Earnipay over 400 times.\n\nNo doubt, there are upsides to shorter payment cycles. For example, an employee can see their salary breakdown from day to day on the app, and unlike a loan or salary advance, which are borrowed funds, an Earnipay withdrawal is earned wages.\n\nStill, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up here as well. For instance, an earner who is unable to manage their personal finances may end up dipping into their salary before payday for the most frivolous reasons, and even after receiving their salary balance at month end, may still struggle to control their spending.\n\nResponding to these concerns, Oyetunji said, \u201cThe main issue here is, we\u2019re not financially educated. Whether you get your money at the end of the month or access it [daily] as you work, if you\u2019re not financially disciplined, Earnipay may not make a difference to your spending habits.\u201d\n\nScaling up\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Africa\u2019s formal and informal economies took hits. Six percent of formal workers were out of work in Malawi, and in Nigeria, that figure climbed to as high as 45%. Now, as Africa adjusts to the reset forced on the entire world by the pandemic, financial well-being across all employment sectors has become more important than ever. \u201cWe\u2019re in a financial health pandemic,\u201d Oyetunji said. \u201cQuality of life is reduced because people can\u2019t fund their everyday needs. How can our expenses be on-demand yet access to salaries earned isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe Earnipay team began building the product in July, received pre-seed funding of an undisclosed amount in August, and took their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to market in September.\n\nCommenting on Earnipay\u2019s plans for 2022, Onwuzulike said, \u201cOur goal is to partner with employers to improve employee financial well-being. We provide tools for income earners to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life. In addition to flexible salary access, we provide financial education to advise employees on best practices to manage their finances, and other products to assist them daily.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After expanding into financial services last year at the back of a $10 million investment from International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Partech, TradeDepot, a Nigerian B2B eCommerce platform, has now raised $110 million in an equity and debt Series B funding round.\n\nThe fund will support the delivery of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services to 5 million SME retailers and drive further expansion of its merchant platform across the continent.\n\nIFC returned and led the equity round, with participation from Novastar, Sahel Capital, CDC Group, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investors, Partech and MSA Capital. The debt funding was led by Arcadia Funds.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTradeDepot started as a consulting firm in 2005 before pivoting into a product-led startup in 2016 to aid seamless milk distribution across Nigeria. Now, the platform is connecting consumer goods brands in Africa directly to a target market of several million retail outlets across the continent, and also providing micro-loans to retailers to enable them to buy more products.\n\nAccording to The World Bank, SMEs represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. In Africa, SME retailers generate $1 trillion in sales annually and contribute $2.6 trillion to the continent\u2019s nominal GDP. But these numbers are only a tiny representation of the sector\u2019s true potential and can\u2019t solve the problem of fragmented distribution networks and lack of access to financing.\n\nVia its ShopTopUp platform, TradeDepot is solving these two major problems, distributing needed goods to retailers and providing them with credit that allows them to stock their inventories and then pay as they sell the goods which have a repayment value of about 5% per month.\n\nTradeDepot has grown from over 40,000 merchants on its platform last year to more than 100,000 merchants. And it says this new funding will further expedite the delivery of its two unique offerings across its operating markets\u201410 cities in Nigeria including Lagos and Abuja, Accra in Ghana, and Johannesburg in South Africa.\n\nSpeaking about the new funding, Onyekachi Izukanne, CEO and co-founder of TradeDepot, said, \u201cWe remain super focused on making digital commerce and financing both accessible and affordable to neighbourhood retailers across key cities in Africa. We are delighted to be joined by an elite group of new investors and have IFC\u2019s Wale Ayeni and Brian Odhambo of Novastar joining our Board of Directors, to support us on this journey to drive growth and prosperity across the continent.\u201d\n\nA retailer navigating the ShopTopUp app\n\nIn 2021 alone, IFC committed a record $31.5 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of technology to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe informal sector is a large and critical part of Africa\u2019s economy, accounting for around 80% of jobs in the region,\u201d said Makhtar Diop, IFC\u2019s Managing Director. \u201cWe are excited to work with TradeDepot to leverage technology to help small businesses across the continent, particularly the many retailers led by women, access the resources they need to grow and scale.\u201d\n\nThe digitisation of SMEs continues to make headlines in Africa this year as startups in the sector like Nigerian Alerzo, Omnibiz, and Sabi have both raised big institutional funding to capture more market share. Similarly, in Northern Africa, Egypt-based Capiter and Appetito, and Morocco-based Chari are also scaling for more market share across the continent.\n\nIt\u2019s a large market, though, and there are still millions of informal businesses that predominantly function offline. But, as for TradeDepot, it wants to capture more than 5 million SMEs as it continues to leverage and expand its BNPL offering in the 12 cities it\u2019s currently operating in.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nThe payment for the shares on PrimaryOffer is facilitated by Flutterwave.

          "title": "Equinix to buy MainOne in push for Africa\u2019s data centre market",
          "text": "Equinix, a US-based global infrastructure company, is perfecting plans to acquire MainOne, one of the largest data centres in West Africa, for $320 million as it moves to become a dominant player in Africa.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed in the first three months of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Funke Opeke, MainOne has a presence in three countries including Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The acquisition marks the first step in Equinix\u2019s long-term strategy to become an African carrier neutral digital infrastructure company. Equinix is betting on Nigeria\u2019s growing population pushing demand for data centres and a spike in the number of operators.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives. CEO Funke Opeke and her team have built a powerful and dynamic infrastructure that will enable international customers access to the continent and African organizations access to the global Equinix platform. Customers can take full advantage of Equinix\u2019s leading global interconnection services to connect with customers and partners, participate in rich digital ecosystems and expand their business across Africa and around the world,\u201d Eugene Bergen, President, EMEA, Equinix, said.\n\nRead also: Nigeria gets AfDB\u2019s $600m to fund digital, creative enterprises next year- Osinbajo\n\nSince it was founded, MainOne has enabled connectivity for the business community of Nigeria and now has digital infrastructure assets including three operational data centres, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in the first quarter of 2022. The facilities generate approximately US$60 million annualized (Q2\u201921LQA) revenue with a purchase multiple of approximately 14x EBITDA.\n\nWhen the acquisition is completed, MainOne\u2019s facilities are expected to add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to the Equinix platform with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centers across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data center and interconnection services for over 10,000 of global businesses, including more than 50 percent of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nMainOne owns and operates a subsea network from Nigeria to Portugal, as well as 1,200 kilometers of reliable terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria. These are all improving connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria. When completed, this acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa, giving organizations based inside and outside of Africa access to one of the world\u2019s fastest growing markets.\n\nCharles Meyers, President, and CEO, Equinix, says the MainOne deal represents a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly African market.\n\n\u201cGrowth of data consumption in Africa is amongst the fastest in the world, and our customers are looking for a trusted partner to pursue the opportunities presented by broad mobile adoption and greater connectivity across the region. MainOne\u2019s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nUnder the terms of the transaction, the management team, including CEO Funke Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles. Opeke holds a master\u2019s in engineering from Columbia University and was named one of the World\u2019s Top 50 Women in Tech by Forbes in 2018 for her efforts in sparking internet adoption. She was also recently named one of the Top 10 Women to Watch in the Data Center Industry by Data Centre Magazine.\n\nMainOne has nearly 500 employees and a management team. It also has an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers, including major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecommunications operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\n\u201cEquinix will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa. I thank our founding shareholders led by Mr. Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, AFC, PAIDF, FBN, Polaris and AfDB for investing in the MainOne vision to bridge the digital divide in Africa. With similar values and culture to what we have jointly built in twelve years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey. The MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition, and we look forward to building our next chapter together,\u201d said Funke Opeke, Founder and CEO, MainOne.",

          "text": "Senior Nigerian bankers say currency speculators are now beginning to bring out the foreign exchange they are hoarding to the market and selling, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, EIU.\n\nIt is seen as reversing the speculative pressure on the Naira since the Central Bank stopped the sale of foreign exchange to bureau de change operators in July but the market still has a long way to go to stabilize.\n\nIn its December 6 report, the EIU said, \u201cthe spread between the official NAFEX exchange rate and the black market widened sharply in the following months, even as foreign reserves increased through a US$3.3bn SDR allocation from the IMF in August and a US$4bn Eurobond sale in September.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthe CBN now appears to be intervening more heavily, with a reserve drawdown of US$600m (1.5%) in the past month. A stabilising market is, according to the committee, causing speculators to sell foreign exchange that had allegedly been hoarded.\u201d\n\nRead Also: FX market opens with naira gaining 0.61% on dollar inflows\n\nThis is expected to give support to the naira although \u201cthere is still a parallel market premium of at least 30%, making illicit arbitrage an irresistible opportunity for some,\u201d the EIU report said.\n\nThe EIU said, \u201canother test to our assumption lies in how a planned end to fuel subsidies in early 2022 plays out. Nigeria\u2019s national oil company is the sole petrol retailer because of the subsidy, and engages in crude\u2011for\u2011fuel swaps that conserve foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cIf the reform goes ahead (not our core forecast so close to an election), petrol will be imported by private marketers exclusively using hard currency. However, with a new mega-refinery coming onstream in 2022, which has the potential to eliminate petrol imports, the CBN may in any case decide to hold out.\u201d\n\nEarly in July, Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank stopped selling hard currency to bureaus de change (BDC) operators. New BDC licences were also suspended. The CBN said it will instead sell foreign exchange only to commercial banks, transacted in the investors and exporters (I&E) window at the official exchange rate (the Nafex)\n\nThe CBN claims that BDCs had been engaged in rent-seeking behaviour, supplying large volumes to single clients (inviting arbitrage opportunities for resale on the parallel market), rather than distributing the foreign exchange sold to them by the CBN to retail customers in small transactions.\n\nThe order was meant to direct foreign-exchange transactions worth billions of US dollars a year to the official I&E window and marked further consolidation of the foreign-exchange market\u2014a process long advocated by the IMF",

          "text": "Two weeks to this year\u2019s Christmas and New Year celebrations, the cost of moving containers from Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports in Lagos has remained stable, a rare case seen first in over eight years due to a decline in the volume of business at the ports, BusinessDay investigation has shown.\n\nThe Tin-Can and Apapa Ports are major economic gateway to Nigeria and account for about 80 percent of the country\u2019s total imports.\n\nAlso, the cost of moving a 40-foot container which used to be between N1, 500,000 and N1, 600,000 in 2020 has, this year, dropped by 76.7 percent and 75 percent in one year to N370, 000 and N400, 000. Similarly, transporting a 20-foot container which cost N800, 000 in 2020, has equally dropped by 56.3 percent N350, 000.\n\nCurrently, shippers pay between N370, 000 and N400, 000 to move a 40-foot container from Apapa to warehouses in Ikeja, Lagos, while a 20-foot container goes for N350, 000 depending on the weight, showing the cost of transportation has remained stable since the second half of the year when the cost dipped.\n\nFrom Tin-Can Port, shippers still pay between N350, 000 and N400, 000 to move one by 40-foot container to Ikeja, while one by 20-foot costs N350, 000.\n\nRead Also: Customs agents shut terminal at Tin-Can Port over cargo pilfering\n\nYuletide season normally comes with celebrations, including parties and other events, making it a peak season for businesses and companies. But with the prevailing decline in business activities at the ports, the rush that comes with the season is yet to be seen.\n\nJonathan Nicol, president of the Shippers Association of Lagos State, said shippers have reduced imports due to the high exchange rate of the naira to dollar, profit decline and payment of heavy taxes on imported goods.\n\nNicol, in a telephone conversation with BusinessDay, also referred to issues around global supply chain disruption that resulted in container shortage and an astronomical rise in the cost of freight.\n\n\u201cThe high exchange rate is a \u2018killer disease\u2019. Most businessmen source their foreign exchange from the black market because getting from Nigerian banks is like a camel passing through the eye of a needle. It is only companies that are regular with the banks that hardly get $100,000. If you bid for $2 million, you hardly get $200,000 for shipment, and to get $2 million would probably spread through the year for the importer to get that kind of money from the bank,\u201d Nicol explained.\n\nHe said shippers were still hoping for a further reduction in the cost of haulage especially if the government makes the roads to the ports motorable.\n\nAccording to him, the construction work is seriously giving shippers problems because goods that pass through the road are not protected due to the constant falling of laden containers caused by potholes and craters.\n\nHe wants the federal ministry of works to expedite action on the ongoing construction on the Westminster to Mile-2 axis of the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, which is causing shippers to lose their goods in transit.\n\nTony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Links Investment Ltd, a clearing and forwarding firm in Lagos, said there was a significant reduction in haulage cost as moving a 40-foot container to Sango-Ota in Ogun State now costs about N600,000 as against N1,000,000 in 2020, while Tin-Can Port to Ladipo now costs N450,000.\n\n\u201cThere is a low volume of business at the ports due to high exchange rate, freight and escalating cases of COVID-19, all of which have limited the number of people traveling abroad for business. The reduction in the gridlock on port roads also helped in reducing the cost of freight,\u201d he added.\n\nEmma Nwabunwanne, a Lagos-based importer, said transportation has remained stable despite the yuletide due to the decline in the volume of business at the nation\u2019s seaport. He added that about 10 to 15 trucks now chase one container, which automatically means the price will drop.\n\n\u201cThe volume of import has dropped and some school of thought puts the reduction rate at 50 percent. Few containers that are coming into the country right now are for the major industries and food companies like Nestle, Dangote, Unilever, Nigerian Breweries, Guinness, and other blue-chip companies that import regularly and their imports are tied to industries,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the high cost of foreign exchange, he said industries need money to buy raw materials, and most companies that used to operate at 100 percent hardly measure up to 50 percent due to the lack of raw materials.",

We are undertaking fundamental reforms in healthcare; emplacing foundational changes in the education system, revamping moribund infrastructure, prioritizing human capital development and fast-tracking programmes and initiatives to drive inclusive growth.\u201d\n\nNoting that the 30-year development plan will drive sustainable socio-economic growth and development in the state over the next three decades, the governor said, \u201cThe last five years have been one of a battle to fix a disarticulated system by reintroducing the discipline and values of planning into government and governance process. We are aware that we need to sustain these deep reforms and initiatives. That is why we unveiled the 30-year development plan process, which we have commenced.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State 30-year Development Plan and the Edo State 30-year Urban and Regional Masterplan will be a grand design to set the new course and direction for one of the most progressive and prosperous sub-national governments in Nigeria,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\n...",

          "text": "Equinix, a global digital infrastructure company, has announced it is acquiring MainOne, Nigeria\u2019s based data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, for $320 million.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022, subject to the \u201csatisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of MainOne, which was announced by Equinix on Monday, follows a series of moves by the company last year when it expanded to India through the acquisition of GPX India for $161 million and 13 data centres from Bell Canada for $780 million.\n\nIn a statement, Equinix acknowledged that acquiring MainOne is the first step in its long-term strategy to become an African carrier neutral digital infrastructure company.\n\n\u201cWith more than 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy and, along with Ghana, has become an established data center hub. This makes the acquisition a pivotal entry point for Equinix into the continent,\u201d the company said in the statement.\n\nFunke Opeke started MainOne in 2010 after noticing the poor internet connectivity Nigerians had to deal with upon her return to the West African country from the U.S., TechCrunch reported.\n\nArmed with over $200 million in equity and debt investment, Opeke built MainOne as West Africa\u2019s first privately owned, open access undersea high capacity cable submarine. It\u2019s a 7,000-kilometer cable stretching from Portugal to West Africa with landings along Accra in Ghana, Dakar in Senegal, Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and Lagos in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also has 1,200 kilometers of terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria in Lagos, Edo and Ogun states. Connectivity to terrestrial sites extends across 65 PoPs (points of presence) in cities across Portugal, Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast.\n\nMainOne\u2019s services are used by over 800 business-to-business customers. They include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecommunications operators, financial service companies and cloud service providers.\n\nHaving enabled connectivity for these businesses via three operational data centers, MainOne plans to open an additional facility in Q1 2022, a move that coincides with Equinix\u2019s acquisition.\n\nMainOne, which has a 500-person team, said its facilities generate approximately $60 million annualized revenue with a purchase multiple of approximately 14x EBITDA.\n\nUpon closing, these facilities will add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to Equinix, with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions.\n\nGlobally, Equinix has 237 data centers across 27 countries. It also provides data center and interconnection services for over 10,000 of the world\u2019s leading businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of MainOne will represent a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly growing African market. MainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d said Charles Meyers, the president and CEO of Equinix in a statement.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world.\u201d\n\nMainOne CEO Funke Opeke and the company\u2019s management team will still continue to serve in their respective roles after the acquisition is finalized.\n\nOpeke said the acquisition will accelerate MainOne\u2019s long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\n\n\u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have jointly built in twelve years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey. The MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition, and we look forward to building our next chapter together,\u201d she added",

          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday put its members on alert over a likely hike in pump price.\n\nIt has commenced mobilisation to shut down the economy, should the Federal Government proceed with its proposed increase of the Premium Motor Spirit from N162 to N340 by next year, 2022.\n\nThe Congress warned that Organised Labour would not fold its hands and watch the Federal Government push more Nigerians below the poverty line.\n\nIt said any attempt to increase the price of petrol would affect every Nigerian regardless of their status.\n\nThe Federal Government last month hinted at a possible fuel hike given the heavy burden of subsidy on the government.\n\nNigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Mele Kyari said petrol will sell between N320 and N340 per litre from February.\n\nHe said Nigeria would be out of the subsidy regime in the first quarter of 2022, but that the Federal Government plans to give N5,000 each to 40 million citizens to cushion the effects.\n\nNLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, who spoke at the 17th NLC Harmattan School in Ilorin, Kwara State, insisted that contrary to some views by seasoned labour unionist Chief Frank Kokori, the Congress was out to empower its members to be better equipped in tackling unfavourable policies that would further impoverish Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe concept of accepting deregulation hook line and sinker anchored on import-driven price model is not something that we can accept. We have said that without mincing words.\n\n\u201cIf you are pushing through our throat to accept deregulation based on importation, basically there will be no end to a price increase.\n\n\u201cSaying that once you deregulate without having the capacity to refine for domestic use will bring down the price of PMS is not correct.\n\n\u201cWhen the price of crude oil was almost at a zero level, the price of two items that were deregulated never came down \u2013 diesel and kerosene. In fact, they kept going up.\n\n\u201cBy the market fundamentals, marketers are out there to make maximum profit and usually they will collude and that is what will happen to Nigeria if we accept that policy hook, line and sinker.\n\n\u201cThe implication is not also on the working class because whether we like it or not, the minimum wage gain has been eroded completely.\n\n\u201cThe major issue under contention is: how do we stabilise the value of the naira? Once you do not stabilise the value of the naira, anything imported will affect the larger economy and the cost of goods and services.\n\n\u201cThis is the reality, so we are calling for a revival of the refineries. Make them to work. Don\u2019t export our jobs. Let us benefit substantially from what God has given us freely.\u201d\n\nWabba indicated that Labour was open discussions.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make pronouncements before inviting labour to the negotiating table because it is like the deed is done. That is why we are also mobilising our people this time around.\n\n\u201cYou are moving the price from N162 or N163 to N340 or N408 if we are to go by the recommendations of the governors forum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how that can be pushed down the throat of Nigerians looking at the impact.\u201d\n\nWabba faulted the government\u2019s proposed N5,000 transport allowance to 40 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the policy of price hike under the name of deregulation will affect every Nigerian citizen either directly or indirectly. I don\u2019t see the wisdom of saying only 40 million people.\n\n\u201cRemember when the Organised Labour submitted a list of the working poor of 50,000 persons on request to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. As I speak to you, not a single person benefitted, yet it is being said that everybody benefitted.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have empirical data even on the poor of the poorest and so, basically, it is going to go the same way those other policies have gone.\n\n\u201cThat is why we said no, because there will be spiral inflation. We have seen that each time there is a slight increase in the pump price of PMS, because of its centrality to our economy, the impact is very humongous.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, said the government was disposed to dialogue with the Organised Labour on the subsidy removal.\n\nAccording to him, the government presently pays N200 billion monthly on petrol subsidies, which he said was not economically sustainable.\n\nKeyamo said: \u201cThe issue of subsidy removal is an economic necessity or the political problem of all governments. It is that political problem we want to address now.\n\n\u201cNLC sees the economic problem and economic necessity but at the same time they have a mandate to ensure that workers welfare are well protected and taken care of.\n\n\u201cThere will be a convergence somewhere but we are prepared to revive all the clashes we have with the labour unions to ensure that we make amicable resolutions.\u201d\n\nKokori urged the labour leaders to look beyond minimum wage and pay more attention to fighting corruption and bad governance.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhy should Nigerian workers allow our refinery to die? What\u2019s the meaning of subsidy? I am not happy with Organised Labour again. You have to fight corruption perpetrated through subsidy. Labour is suppose to be the tribune of the people.\n\n\u201cYou have to fight corruption because where there is corruption there is no country.\u201d Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday put its members on alert over a likely hike in pump price.\n\nIt has commenced mobilisation to shut down the economy, should the Federal Government proceed with its proposed increase of the Premium Motor Spirit from N162 to N340 by next year, 2022.\n\nThe Congress warned that Organised Labour would not fold its hands and watch the Federal Government push more Nigerians below the poverty line.\n\nIt said any attempt to increase the price of petrol would affect every Nigerian regardless of their status.\n\nThe Federal Government last month hinted at a possible fuel hike given the heavy burden of subsidy on the government.\n\nNigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Mele Kyari said petrol will sell between N320 and N340 per litre from February.\n\nHe said Nigeria would be out of the subsidy regime in the first quarter of 2022, but that the Federal Government plans to give N5,000 each to 40 million citizens to cushion the effects.\n\nNLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, who spoke at the 17th NLC Harmattan School in Ilorin, Kwara State, insisted that contrary to some views by seasoned labour unionist Chief Frank Kokori, the Congress was out to empower its members to be better equipped in tackling unfavourable policies that would further impoverish Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe concept of accepting deregulation hook line and sinker anchored on import-driven price model is not something that we can accept. We have said that without mincing words.\n\n\u201cIf you are pushing through our throat to accept deregulation based on importation, basically there will be no end to a price increase.\n\n\u201cSaying that once you deregulate without having the capacity to refine for domestic use will bring down the price of PMS is not correct.\n\n\u201cWhen the price of crude oil was almost at a zero level, the price of two items that were deregulated never came down \u2013 diesel and kerosene. In fact, they kept going up.\n\n\u201cBy the market fundamentals, marketers are out there to make maximum profit and usually they will collude and that is what will happen to Nigeria if we accept that policy hook, line and sinker.\n\n\u201cThe implication is not also on the working class because whether we like it or not, the minimum wage gain has been eroded completely.\n\n\u201cThe major issue under contention is: how do we stabilise the value of the naira? Once you do not stabilise the value of the naira, anything imported will affect the larger economy and the cost of goods and services.\n\n\u201cThis is the reality, so we are calling for a revival of the refineries. Make them to work. Don\u2019t export our jobs. Let us benefit substantially from what God has given us freely.\u201d\n\nWabba indicated that Labour was open discussions.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make pronouncements before inviting labour to the negotiating table because it is like the deed is done. That is why we are also mobilising our people this time around.\n\n\u201cYou are moving the price from N162 or N163 to N340 or N408 if we are to go by the recommendations of the governors forum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how that can be pushed down the throat of Nigerians looking at the impact.\u201d\n\nWabba faulted the government\u2019s proposed N5,000 transport allowance to 40 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the policy of price hike under the name of deregulation will affect every Nigerian citizen either directly or indirectly. I don\u2019t see the wisdom of saying only 40 million people.\n\n\u201cRemember when the Organised Labour submitted a list of the working poor of 50,000 persons on request to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. As I speak to you, not a single person benefitted, yet it is being said that everybody benefitted.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have empirical data even on the poor of the poorest and so, basically, it is going to go the same way those other policies have gone.\n\n\u201cThat is why we said no, because there will be spiral inflation. We have seen that each time there is a slight increase in the pump price of PMS, because of its centrality to our economy, the impact is very humongous.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, said the government was disposed to dialogue with the Organised Labour on the subsidy removal.\n\nAccording to him, the government presently pays N200 billion monthly on petrol subsidies, which he said was not economically sustainable.\n\nKeyamo said: \u201cThe issue of subsidy removal is an economic necessity or the political problem of all governments. It is that political problem we want to address now.\n\n\u201cNLC sees the economic problem and economic necessity but at the same time they have a mandate to ensure that workers welfare are well protected and taken care of.\n\n\u201cThere will be a convergence somewhere but we are prepared to revive all the clashes we have with the labour unions to ensure that we make amicable resolutions.\u201d\n\nKokori urged the labour leaders to look beyond minimum wage and pay more attention to fighting corruption and bad governance.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhy should Nigerian workers allow our refinery to die? What\u2019s the meaning of subsidy? I am not happy with Organised Labour again. You have to fight corruption perpetrated through subsidy. Labour is suppose to be the tribune of the people.\n\n\u201cYou have to fight corruption because where there is corruption there is no country.\u201d Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Dowen College Parents\u2019 Forum in Lagos State has demanded an overhaul of the school management and hostel teachers as well as the installation of Closed Circuit Television cameras in the school as the death of 12-year-old student, Sylvester Oromoni, continues to gain prominence nationwide.\n\nThe parents\u2019 forum, which condemned the death of the student, said a candle light procession would be held for him on Wednesday.\n\nIn a release obtained by SaharaReporters on Tuesday and signed by Aituaz Kola-Oladejo, Waheed Adeoye, Oluwaseun Bolanle Ajila and Kingsley Kema Agu, the parents stated that what happened to Sylvester \u201ccould have happened to any other child in the school.\u201d\n\nThe forum said, \u201cDowen College Parents are startled and deeply saddened by the unfortunate incident that led to the death of Sylvester Oromoni. Our hearts go out to the family of the deceased and pray that God gives them the strength to bear the irreparable loss.\n\n\u201cAs parents of Dowen college students, we are still in shock and could not come to terms with this incident and the accounts so far provided by the school,students, and the media.\n\n\u201cWe urge the school management team and other stakeholders (students and parents directly or indirectly mentioned) to fully cooperate with the authority in the ongoing investigation. While we would have loved to bring Sylvester back if humanly possible, unravelling the cause of Sylvester\u2019s death and bringing whoever was responsible or might have contributed in whatever way to book,will not only bring this unfortunate incident to a closure for the family, but this will also serve as a deterrent to others in all schools in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe therefore say justice for Sylvester, is justice for all. On our part as parents, we will work more closely with the school (management/board), to ensure necessary measures are put in place to prevent a reoccurrence of this unfortunate incident and stamp out bulling in any form from the school.\n\n\u201cWe therefore earnesly ask for a resolution that will bring some relief to the bereaved family, other parents, students of Dowen College and the public.\n\n\u201cThese should include a change of the school management and hostel teachers, installation of CCTV cameras in all strategic places and overhauling of the school security system.\n\n\u201cThe Parents\u2019 Forum is organising a Candle Light event. Details of which are as follow: Wednesday, December 8, 6pm; Dowen College. The lighting of candles is to pay tribute to a life \u2018passed\u2019 and keeping the light burning signifies that the memory still lives on and burns bright.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that the Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, revealed that three students of the college were currently being investigated over the death of Sylvester.\n\nAlthough Odumosu did not give the identities of those in custody, but had insisted that they were the main suspects.\n\nSaharaReporters also reported that the Oromoni family had hired the firm of human rights lawyer and activist, Femi Falana, SAN, to prosecute its case against the institution over the death of their son.\n\nThe human rights lawyer\u2019s chambers had written to the office of Lagos State\u2019s Chief Coroner, requesting an inquest into the circumstances leading to the death of his client\u2019s child.\n\nThe letter was dated December 6, 2021, signed by Taiwo Olawale, and addressed to the chief coroner, High Court of Lagos State.\n\nThe story of 12-year-old Sylvester went viral last week after a family member went on social media to demand justice.\n\nIn a series of Tweets, the family member, with handle @Perrisonoromoni said Sylvester was assaulted by some senior students of Dowen College.\n\nHe added that Sylvester died after sustaining multiple internal injuries from being tortured and bullied.\n\nAlso, in a video released online by the family member, Oromoni Jr was seen writing in pain. His teeth were stained dark red with blood. His legs were swollen, and his belly was bloated.\n\nThe Management of Dowen College in a statement had claimed that Sylvester was injured while playing football. In another statement, they assured that they would cooperate with authorities to investigate the incident.\n\nThe Lagos State government through its Ministry of Education paid an inquiry visit to the college and announced on Friday that the school be shut down indefinitely.",

          "text": "Three students from Dowen College, Lekki Lagos, have been arrested by the Lagos Police Command for their suspected involvement in the death of Sylvester Oromoni junior, a 12-year-old student at the college.\n\nHakeem Odumosu, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, made the announcement on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a Channels Television report, Odumosi stated that three of the five students mentioned by Sylvester before his death are already in custody and collaborating with authorities in their investigation.\n\nDespite the fact that Odumosu did not reveal the names of those detained, he emphasized that they are major suspects.\n\nThe command is preparing to conduct a post mortem on the body in Delta state to determine the cause of death, according to the police chief.\n\nHe stated that the conclusion of the probe into Sylvester\u2019s death will pique the interest of police officials in both Lagos and Delta State.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oromoni family has retained the services of Femi Falana, a prominent human rights lawyer and activist, to fight their lawsuit against the institution for their son\u2019s death.\n\nThe letter addressed by Falana to the office of Lagos State\u2019s Chief Coroner, demanding an investigation into the circumstances leading to the death of his client\u2019s kid, was obtained by Channels Television on Monday.\n\nThe letter, dated December 6, 2021, was signed by Taiwo Olawale and submitted to the High Court of Lagos State\u2019s chief coroner.\n\nLast week, Sylvester\u2019s 12-year-old story became viral after a family member took to social media to demand justice.

Banks did not open for business as well.\n\nSome residents expressed their dissatisfaction with the exercise\u2019s negative impact on their livelihood.\n\nAs the holiday season neared, they called for an end to it.\n\nAlthough IPOB had overturned the order, Chief Osita Udeh, Chairman of the Ngbuka Obosi Market Association, told our reporter that insufficient security, a lack of understanding, and fear of assault had caused the people to continue to observe it.\n\nUdeh said, \u201cOnitsha is the commercial centre of Anambra and the continued closure of commercial activities every Monday is having a huge effect on the state. We are losing incomes running into hundreds of millions of naira which is not good enough.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the women leader, Onitsha Main Market Association, Mrs Celine Chigbu, said, \u201cThis Monday sit-at-home is affecting income generation, Monday is a serious day for commercial activities because people come from outside the state. If government provides adequate security maybe people will have the confidence to come out.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Esther Udo, who works in Awka, said she could not access her workplace on Mondays as a result of absence of transportation.\n\nHowever, the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Don Adinuba, said there was no sit-at-home as the government had told the people to go about their lawful businesses.\n\nHe said, \u201cActivities are going on in Awka and other areas; the government has told the people to ignore the sit-at-home order but if the people of Onitsha decide to do otherwise, there is nothing the government can do. The government cannot force anybody to go to his business place.\u201d\n\nAlso, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Ikenga Tochukwu, urged the people to ignore the sit-at-home order.\n\n\u201cIf you have followed closely the trend of tackling security concern in the state, you will agree with me that the police and the security community are winning. Our presence has dominated the space and this id among the strategies that the police command is implementing to sustain the public peace and safety,\u201d the PPRO added.\n\nEfforts to get the spokesperson for IPOB, Emma Powerful, proved abortive as several calls to his phone line rang out.

          "text": "The federal government Monday accused the United Kingdom of bias by adding Nigeria to the red list which bans Nigerians from travelling to the UK over the outbreak of Omicron COVID variant.\n\nDescribing it as prejudiced and discriminatory, the government said the decision lacked common sense and cannot be backed by science.\n\nNigeria became the latest country to be added to the UK\u2019s travel \u2018red list\u2019 Monday, with all 11 others on the list located in Africa.\n\nBy the red list, the only people allowed to enter the UK from them are UK or Irish nationals and residents. Anyone returning from red-list nations has to self-isolate for 10 days at their own expense in a government-approved hotel.\n\nThe UK\u2019s decision to impose restrictions on Nigeria was announced Saturday.\n\nAdducing reasons for the ban weekend, the UK authority said 21 of the new variant cases were traceable to Nigeria, even as the federal government announced three cases were discovered since the new variant broke out.\n\nBy the announcement, the travel ban commenced 4.00am Monday (today).\n\nAnd coincidentally, the British Airways cancelled the Lagos-London flight Sunday for what it called operational reasons.\n\nHowever, the BA, according to reports, has since resumed operations in and out of Nigeria Monday.\n\nFG\u2019s position\n\nCondemning the travel ban at a media parley in Abuja Monday, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed wondered why British citizens travelling from Nigeria would be allowed in but non Britons from same country would be denied.\n\nThe minister who said the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) would respond appropriately to the development, however said, as the government\u2019s spokesman, he still needed to speak up.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the Spokesman for the Federal Government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by the British government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned. The two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive.\u201d\n\nThe minister further said \u201cthe travel ban, the type that has been slammed on some African countries, is a knee-jerk reaction that can only be detrimental to our quest to most conclusively tackle this pandemic. Instead of these reflex responses that are driven by fear, rather than science, why can\u2019t the world take a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, and ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition.\n\n\u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries. Even before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU.\n\n\u201cSome of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines. This is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called Travel Apartheid. Let the world know that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nPSC reviews travel protocol\n\nMohammed also noted that \u201cin the wake of the discovery of Omicron, the PSC has reviewed its International Travel Protocol. The revised protocol, which came into effect yesterday (5 Dec., 2021), is aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern.\n\n\u201cUnder the revised protocol, passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of and comply with the following rules:- COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure \u2013 Post-arrival Day 2 COVID-19 PCR test \u2013 Self-isolation for 7 days (for unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated individuals) \u2013 Day 7 post-arrival exit PCR test (for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals).\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, out-bound passengers are required to provide: Valid evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19 \u2013 Negative PCR test result within 48hrs from the time boarding.\n\n\u201cThese are science-driven actions, rather than those based on emotions and other extraneous reasons. However, if any country is not satisfied with them, why not simply subject Nigerians arriving in their country to their own PCR tests and proven conditions, like quarantine, instead of banning them outrightly?\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope the British government will immediately review the decision to put Nigeria on its red list and rescind it immediately. Nigeria has handled the Covid-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts. Nigeria does not belong on any country\u2019s red list.\u201d\n\nAnswering reporters\u2019 questions, the minister said: \u201cWhat some countries expected of the pandemic here didn\u2019t happen and that\u2019s why they are undermining our certificates (vaccination). It\u2019s pure prejudice and discrimination. It\u2019s not backed common sense; it\u2019s not backed by science.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s travel apartheid\u2019\n\nIn a similar condemnation, Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to the UK, Mr Sarafa Tunji Isola, described the ban as a \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d and urged officials to adopt a more \u201cglobal approach.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the BBC Monday, Ishola said the targeted approach taken by the British government had limited travel to and from some African nations.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres having also used the term \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d last week while speaking to reporters in New York. The UN chief claimed that travel restrictions, such as those imposed by the UK, are \u201cnot only deeply unfair and punitive\u201d, but are ultimately \u201cineffective.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Ghana\u2019s President Nana Akufo-Addo criticized countries for imposing restrictions on African nations, calling the measures \u201cinstruments of immigration control.\u201d\n\nUK Minister Kit Malthouse refuted the allegation, stating that the use of the phrase \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d is \u201cvery unfortunate language.\u201d Defending the restrictions, he argued that they are helpful in giving British health officials \u201ca little bit of time\u201d to \u201cwork on the virus and assess how difficult it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nThe UK\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care has also stood by the restrictions, noting that the government will continue to keep the potential risk posed by individual countries and territories under review as regards what levels of precaution are required.\n\nBritish Airways resume\n\nMeanwhile, United Kingdom carrier, British Airways (BA) Monday offered explanations for its flight disruptions.\n\nAn electronic statement made available to journalists by the management indicated that all flights from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos into London Heathrow have been retimed due to restrictions at London Heathrow to support arrivals from a red-list country.\n\nThe airline noted that all its customers travelling from Nigeria must follow the UK government\u2019s rules on arrivals from a red-listed country and have a negative PCR test result within the 48 hours prior to their departure from Nigeria.\n\n\u201dAs a result of the UK Government placing Nigeria on to the red list, we continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust our schedule accordingly. All flights from Lagos to London Heathrow have been retimed. This is due to restrictions at London Heathrow to support arrivals from a red-list country.\n\n\u201cAll customers travelling from Nigeria must follow the UK government\u2019s rules on arrivals from a red-listed country and have a negative PCR test result within the 48 hours prior to their departure from Nigeria. Find out more at gov.uk\n\n\u201dOnly British or Irish nationals or customers who have residence rights in the UK will be allowed to enter the UK, where they will be required to quarantine in a government facility.\n\n\u201cArrivals from Nigeria will land at Heathrow Terminal 5 where any customer whose journey terminates, will be taken on a bus to Terminal 4 for processing prior to being escorted to their pre-purchased quarantine hotel. Customer\u2019s bags will also be taken directly to Terminal 4.\n\n\u201dAny customers wishing to transfer must follow the rules for their final destination. We understand how uncertain the times are and as such Customers have the following options to change their travel.\n\n\u201cCredit for future travel under our Book with Confidence policy. Re-accommodation using Lufthansa or Qatar Airways, if your flight is cancelled,\u201d the statement further directed.\n\nIt stated that \u201cdue to the retiming of Lagos to London Heathrow, a full refund is permitted on ba.com or through your travel agents.\u201d",

          "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic and other disease outbreaks in Nigeria are nothing compared to the real enemies of the country, said Professor Oyewale Tomori.\n\nTomori, a professor of virology, stated this on Monday at the National COVID-19 Summit organised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) in Abuja.\u2019\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is not the enemy, Lassa fever is of minor league, yellow fever is yellow-livered, monkeypox is child\u2019s play, cholera is a dehydrator,\u201d he told the audience at the summit. \u201cOur underdevelopment and backwardness rest on four pillars \u2013 they are the real enemies of our nation.\n\n\u201cThey are (1) lack of patriotism \u2013 the destroyer of our nation; (2) self-interest \u2013 the burial ground of our national interest; (3) corruption \u2013 the executor of our underdevelopment, and (4) shamelessness \u2013 the destruction of our national pride.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria\u2019s Import Bill Grows As Exports Remain Oil-Dependent: NBS\n\nAccording to the virologist, these diseases have become the combined endemic demolisher of the foundation of the individual\u2019s health security over the last 60 years.\n\nHe added that they have shaken the foundation of the nation\u2019s health security and in turn determined the country\u2019s irrelevance in contributing meaningfully to global health security.\n\n\u201cAnytime I think of Nigeria, I have Nigeria on my mind,\u201d an emotional Tomori sobbed. \u201cI speak with passion\u2026 (he sobs again) I\u2019m deeply emotional. I have wept for this country on several occasions, I will try not to do such again, but it looks like I am failing because I owe this country much more than I can pay back.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the first epidemic authorities must address was the particular one affecting the culture and true identity of the people as Nigerians.\n\nErrors Of Omission\n\nThe virologist believes the government has been lying to the people while the people, on their part, have also been responding with more lies.\n\nHe called for a nation where national interest would bury self-interest, saying the summit would become a mirage and a vapour if that was not the case.\n\nTomori stressed the need to build back better on the nation\u2019s culture, warning that the outcome of the summit could become another \u201cexpensive exercise in futility\u201d.\n\nOn the recent action by the United Kingdom and Canada, he said, \u201cI woke up recently, just today to hear that Canada no longer recognises my genuine vaccination card, and Britain has clamped a travel ban on me.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, I had to know there was Omicron in Nigeria from outside. Same Canada was telling me that Nigerians who travelled out with negative COVID laboratory results were omicronised, before my own CDC finally tells me that we had the variant, detected in samples collected from people who recently travelled from South Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask myself, were they people on the entourage of President (Cyril) Ramaphosa or were they other people? They did not tell us that. We painfully call the reactions of the UK and Canada racism, inequity, but I say we are paying for condoning our errors of commission and overlooking our errors of omission.\n\n\u201cMr President, the generation of Nigerians we have today is much smarter than my generation. Give them one-tenth of the enabling environment opportunity which good governance gave my generation, and Nigeria will be donating vaccines to poor Europe as India is doing; Nigeria will be providing loans to China, and not the other way round,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "A former Minister of Information and Culture, Professor Jerry Gana, has described the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to implement the 2014 National Conference report \u201cas a terrible mistake\u201d.\n\nGana, who said the non-implementation of the confab report was largely responsible for some of the growing agitations and disunity across the country, however, said Nigerians were better off together as a people and country.\n\nGana, who spoke on Sunday in Uvwiamuge, Agbarho, Delta State, during the thanksgiving service to conclude activities marking the 90th anniversary of the Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) Worldwide, said there would hardly be peace in the absence of justice and fairness in any society.\n\nThe elder statesman, however, maintained that, he did not share sentiments of persons, who were clamouring for the balkanisation of the country, saying he believed strongly in a united Nigeria, where justice and fairness were served to everyone irrespective of political or religious inclinations.\n\n\u201cWe, in the middlebelt of Nigeria, are great lovers of peace, justice and fairness. The last administration convened a national conference in 2014 and we agreed on some certain fundamentals to ensure justice and fairness. Unfortunately, when this government came in, they made a terrible mistake. They never touched that report and that is the problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are now saying we should start that conversation. We should talk to one another and assure one another of justice and fairness, because without equity, there can\u2019t be peace. Without equity, we cannot be together. Let me appeal to the federal government to promote peace, equity and justice. Let me also appeal to those people, who are agitating that there\u2019s tremendous power in being united. Let\u2019s not fight to scatter and divide Nigeria. We are better being together,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe congratulated the Urhobo Nation on the 90th anniversary of UPU, stressing that Urhobo people had played prominent roles in stabilising and promoting the unity of Nigeria.\n\nThe former minister, had at an earlier engagement, said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would be swept out of office in 2023, because it had committed a lot of injustices against humanity, adding that Nigerians were fed up with their leaders.\n\nGana said this at the weekend in Effurun, near Warri, Delta State, while delivering a lecture titled: \u201cRaising 21st Century Leaders for Nigeria\u201d at Youth Arise Conference 2021.\n\nThe Youth Arise Nigeria Conference with large turnout in attendance from within and Outside Delta was put together by Advocates of Paradigm Shift in Governance.\n\nThey included Deacon Chris Iyowaye, Hon. Gibson Akporehe, Phillip Adu-Odogwu, Cogent Owhe and Lady E Ejiro Umukoro with the goal of raising the civic and political consciousness of youths in how they engage governance, get their PVC as a civic duty while volunteering and investing their time in being useful citizens rather than be purchaseable electorate.\n\nSylvester Idowu in Warri",

          "title": "Omicron: UK Under Fire for Travel Apartheid against Nigeria",
          "text": "As global outrage continues to trail recent travel ban placed on Nigeria and some other African countries by the United Kingdom (UK), a development which has been described as racist and discriminatory, Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Monday officially condemned the decision of the UK to put the country on its red list and place a ban on foreign travels following its detection of Omicron variant.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who addressed journalists in Abuja, described the decision of the UK government targeting Nigerian travellers as discriminatory, unfair, punitive, indefensible and unjust.\n\nThe Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, also joined to strongly condemn what he termed \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d being meted on some developing countries, mostly in Africa as part of their strategy to curtail the spread of Omicron variant.\n\nThis is just as Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to the UK, Sarafa Tunji Isola, who was on a media round in UK yesterday, aligned with the position of the Guterres in describing the action by the UK government as \u201ctravel apartheid.\u201d\n\nIsola said what was expected on the matter was a global approach to halt the spread of the disease and not selective punishment.\n\nSpeaking further, the minister also questioned the decision of the UK government, saying it was not driven by science.\n\nThe UK has now joined other countries, including Canada, which have taken a similar action against Nigeria over Omicron.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned.\n\n\u201cThe two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive,\u201d Mohammed fumed.\n\nHe also raised eyebrows against the UK government action, insisting Omicron did not originate in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLet me say straight away that it\u2019s up to the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) to respond to this action by the British government and others, and I have no doubt that the Committee will respond appropriately.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the spokesman for the federal government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by the British government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the British took a decision that was prompted by reflex responses instead of science and taking a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, \u201cas well as ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that such knee-jack reaction of placing a travel ban on Nigeria would be detrimental to the country\u2019s quest to conclusively tackle the pandemic.\n\nThe minister added: \u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries.\n\n\u201cEven before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU. Some of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called \u2018Travel Apartheid.\u2019 Let the world know that no one is safe until everyone is safe\u201d\n\nHe stressed that in the wake of the discovery of Omicron, the PSC, unlike the UK adopted science-driven actions, rather than those based on emotions and other extraneous reasons.\n\nAccording to him, PSC reviewed its International Travel Protocol, which took effect on Sunday, December 5, 2021, aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern.\n\nUnder the revised protocol, passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of and comply with rules including COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure, post-arrival Day 2 COVID-19 PCR test, self-isolation for seven days (for unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated individuals) and day 7 post-arrival exit PCR test (for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals) among others.\n\n\u201cIf any country is not satisfied with them, why not simply subject Nigerians arriving in their country to their own PCR tests and proven conditions, like quarantine, instead of banning them out rightly?\u201d he wondered.\n\nMuhammed expressed hope that the British government would review the decision to ban Nigeria and rescind its decision immediately, saying Nigeria should not be on the red list as it had handled the COVID-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts.\n\nUN Secretary General Rejects \u2018Travel Apartheid\u2019\n\nSpeaking in an interview, Guterres insisted that targeting the most vulnerable nations with travel ban for revealing the existence of the virus that was already present in Europe was unacceptable in a world that has the instruments to ensure safe travel.\n\nGuterres said travel apartheid must be condemned, saying it was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe have the instruments to have safe travels, let us use those instruments to avoid this kind of\u2026 allow me to say, travel apartheid, which I think is unacceptable. What is unacceptable is to have one part of the world that is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world economy condemned to a lockout when they were the ones that revealed the existence of a new variant that, by the way already existed in other parts of the world, including in Europe as we know.\n\n\u201cSo this is a very strong appeal that I launch, an appeal to commonsense that with a virus that is truly borderless travel restrictions that isolate anyone or country or region are not only deeply unfair and punitive they are ineffective.\u201d\n\nIn a move that many have described as rushed, ill-advised and lacking scientific basis added Nigeria to its red list, which contains 11 mostly Southern African countries becomes effective from today.\n\nIn addition, on Monday, the UK government, took further measures against Nigeria as the British High Commission announced that it would pause \u201cmaking decisions\u201d on visitor visa applications from all red list countries, including Nigeria.\n\nLatest figures from the UK government on its website revealed that 21 cases of omicron reported in England were linked to travel from Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to UK kicks against Restriction\n\nOn his part, Isola, in an interview with BBC, described the travel ban as an apartheid in the sense that, \u201cwe are not dealing with an endemic. We are dealing with a pandemic. Whenever we have a challenge there must be collaboration.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigeria\u2019s Minister of Health did come out with a statement yesterday saying between November 22nd and 28th, 67 passengers that tested positive were discovered in Nigeria and many of them happened to be travellers from the UK. But that would not be a basis for Nigeria taking such action against UK.\n\n\u201cThe message is very clear. If there was a mistake, it takes courage of leadership to admit it was an error and not a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the cases of omicron discovered in Nigeria were from in-bound travelers.\n\nAccording to him, a lot of persons would be greatly affected by the action of the UK government, saying, \u201ca lot of people have gone home \u2013 doctors, nurses \u2013 who are working in the UK and providing health services to NHIS and you can imagine the effect, even on Britain. In addition, we are talking of the anger of 200 million people. This decision is going to hamper our relationship with UK, which is why I am not happy about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs at today, this variant is classified as a mild one and there has not been any hospitalisation nor death, scientist still working on it. This is quite different from the Delta variant and decision must be based on scientific and empirical evidence.\n\n\u201cWe must have the facts that the variant we are talking about is dangerous. And that is why we need collaboration all over the world to ascertain the nature of the variant,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UK, at the weekend, had updated its so called Red List, indicating countries prohibited from entering the UK in view of the new COVID-19 variant called \u201comicron\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking with Arise News Channel yesterday, Ishola revealed that Nigeria would this week begin high level discussions with UK, in its efforts to seek a quick and amicable resolution to the restriction of Nigerians from visiting the country.\n\nHe said this week, Nigeria would begin talks with the British government, but quickly added that he was not willing to pre-empt what the country would do if its request to be delisted from the list was ignored.\n\nHe opined that under normal circumstances, the world should have saluted the efforts of the South African Medical Association for alerting everyone to the Omicron variant and rally round to solve the problem rather than the discriminatory action.\n\nThe high commissioner maintained South Africa had confirmed that the variant does not involve any hospitalisation or death, stressing that the issue of slamming bans on account of a \u201cmild variant\u201d was not the right thing to do.\n\nWhile stating that the coronavirus did not originate from Africa, he noted that the leaders of the continent were doing everything to ensure that the vaccines come to Africa but that what comes to Africa has been very limited.\n\nAccording to the envoy, Nigeria has handled the COVID-19 pandemic excellently and should be commended , reason the travel restrictions this time is causing an outrage.\n\nWhile insisting that the UK\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t backed by scientific evidence, he said: \u201cSo, this is not acceptable. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making it very clear. There is no scientific evidence as of today that shows that this variant is deadlier.\u201d\n\nHe narrated that Nigerians were already reacting to the travel ban in their different ways, recalling that on a on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Lagos earlier in the day, only 24 people were on board which was a form of subtle protest because an average Nigerian does not believe that the country deserves the shabby treatment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure many of them will not subject themselves to such (conditions). The travel ban came Saturday night. Today is the first working day and I can assure you that before the end of the week, we will engage with the host authorities,\u201d he assured.\n\nHe mentioned that with a relationship that dates back more than a century, both countries be deepening their ties rather than taking actions that will taint the relationship.\n\n\u201cThe ties between Nigeria and Britain date back to more than one century. This relationship is not where it should be. And we\u2019re just making efforts to deepen the relationship before this ban came up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to think that there won\u2019t be a reconsideration of the decision. We\u2019ll have to dialogue at the end of the day to have a compromise on this issue,\u201d the envoy added.\n\nStating that the matter has its economic and political dimensions, he expressed that hope that the British government will reverse the decision as it does not make much sense to ban a country with three cases where\u2019s those with tens of cases were not listed.\n\nStakeholders, Travellers Condemn UK\u2019s Decision to Put Nigeria on Red list\n\nIn a related development, aviation industry stakeholders and air travellers have condemned the decision of UK to put Nigeria on its redlist.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY Monday, the Chief Operating Officer of Dana Air, Mr. Obi Mbanuzuo, described the decision of UK as a knee-jerk reaction, saying the UK was aware that the omicron was already in Europe even before South Africa announced it to the world, but failed to take action.\n\n\u201cThis is a knee jerk reaction which will be soon reversed once they realise that Omicron is already deeply embedded in UK. They can\u2019t keep omicron put by banning Nigerians. What of the Netherlands where we now know had omicron even before the South Africans announced it?\u201d Mbanuzuo said.\n\nAlso, the Managing Director of Flight and Logistics Solutions Limited, Mr. Amos Akpan, said the UK government\u2019s decision was not backed by scientific data.\n\n\u201cThe data in public domain shows higher number of infected persons found in UK, while the official data says only three cases found in Nigeria. The Omicron variant existed in Spain and a few European countries before a South African scientist pronounced its existence.\n\n\u201cThe strict restrictions on Nigerians and other Africans are scientifically unjustified. Therefore, we are left to view it as a kneejerk political reaction. If they stop Nigerians from entry into UK, will they also stop Spanish, Germans, Italians, and Indonesians, who have higher number of infections of the Omicron variant?\n\n\u201cPlaying politics with medical science to this extent smacks of apartheid and racism and will not stop further mutation and spread of the virus. The season for this kneejerk reaction is bad for air travel and tourism business for UK, and for Nigeria. British Airways, Virgin Atlantic Airways will feel the impact,\u201d Akpan added.\n\nIn his contribution, the President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye condemned the decision of the UK to put Nigeria in the red list and said it was totally uncalled for.\n\nShe disclosed that a lot of Nigerians and students in the UK who wanted to come to Nigeria have since cancelled their travel plans, regretting that the action taken by the UK could discourage vaccination.\n\n\u201cThe decision taken by the UK by putting Nigeria on the red list is affecting our business. Many people have cancelled their flights. You know, the UK is second home to many Nigerians. A lot of people are cancelling their travel plans because they know if they come to Nigeria they will be made to pay over 2000 pounds and they said they would only review this by December 20, 2021.\n\n\u201cThey will review it but it is totally uncalled for. That action will discourage vaccination. After all, Delta variant of COVID-19 appeared in the UK in February this year but there was no overreaction like this. This is making people not to go for the vaccine. It is unlike the US, which is saying that it is only fully vaccinated people that can come,\u201d she said.\n\nTravel expert and the organiser of Akwaaba African Travel Market, Ikechi Ukoh told THISDAY that it was disappointing that the UK could put Nigeria on the red list as the two countries have very close relationship and there is nothing Nigeria has done that the UK was not involved.\n\nSpeaking in similar vein, industry consultant and the CEO of Belujane Konsult, Chris Aligbe said that as a country, the UK took the decision to protect its citizens, even though he pointed out that such a decision was hasty.\n\nHowever, the Regional Airport Manager, South West in charge of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Terminal, Lagos, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba, told THISDAY that the UK carriers, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operated their flights from Lagos on Monday but the only difference was that BA had shifted its flights from night to morning.\n\nShe said that there was no indication yet that other international carriers have received any directive from their host countries, adding that airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and others operated their normal flights from Lagos.\n\nThe Secretary General of Aviation Round Table, a think-tank group in the industry, Group Captain John Ojikutu (retd), told THISDAY that considering the long, good relations Nigeria has with the UK, putting Nigeria on red list was condemnable.\n\nHe said that diplomatic relations was guided by the principle of reciprocity, noting that Nigeria could ban UK nationals but not British Carriers, as UK did not ban Nigerian carriers, but Nigerian citizens.\n\nOjikutu added: \u201cWhat economic sense would it make for BA to be coming to Nigeria under its COVID-19 rules when 90 per cent of its inbound and outbound passengers are Nigerians?\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo, Olawale Ajimotokan, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja; Chinedu Eze andDike Onwuamaeze in Lagos",
          "summary": "The UK has now joined other countries, including Canada, which have taken a similar action against Nigeria over Omicron.\nHe also raised eyebrows against the UK government action, insisting Omicron did not originate in Nigeria.\nLatest figures from the UK government on its website revealed that 21 cases of omicron reported in England were linked to travel from Nigeria.\nThe season for this kneejerk reaction is bad for air travel and tourism business for UK, and for Nigeria.\nHe said that diplomatic relations was guided by the principle of reciprocity, noting that Nigeria could ban UK nationals but not British Carriers, as UK did not ban Nigerian carriers, but Nigerian citizens.",
