          "title": "Fayemi, Akeredolu absent as S\u2019West leaders endorse ranching, state police",
          "text": "Leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the South-West, including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and governors in the region, on Sunday reinforced the call for true federalism and ban of open grazing in the country.\n\nThe party leaders, who met in Lagos, backed some of the decisions of the Southern governors in Asaba, Delta State, saying there was the need for the Federal Government to address insecurity in the country.\n\nAlso at the meeting were the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; governors of Lagos, Ogun and Osun states, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Mr Dapo Abiodun and Mr Adegboyega Oyetola, respectively; a former interim chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande; General Alani Akinrinde (rtd.); a former governor of Ogun State, Aremo Segun Osoba; Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, Pius Akinyelure, among others.\n\nReading the nine points communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the deliberation, Akande, who convened the meeting, said they were concerned about the state of the nation.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 reads partly, \u201cFor Nigeria to overcome these challenges, we must do so with unity of purpose and action. The desire for peace and the chance for a prosperous and just society are universal and transcend all regional, religious or ethnic divisions. Sadly, many public figures have made statements that spark division and undermine the needed unity of purpose.\n\n\u201cWe hold to the view that true federalism where more power and resources are allocated to the states will be an essential part in strengthening society and improving democratic governance so that we beat the present challenges but also engender durable peace and security. True federalism and the reallocation of resources and authority that comes with it will empower the states to solve localised issues before they spread and transform into national ones. In addition to mitigating political competition for control of the national government, greater federalism will empower grassroots economic development and political reforms that will stand as bulwarks against the terrorism and criminality now experienced in too many parts of the nation. A hallmark of this enhanced federalism will be the establishment of state police forces.\n\n\u201cWe endorse the position of the southern governors taken at their May 11, 2021 summit in Asaba, Delta State, regarding ranching. We do so because such a decision will lessen tensions between farmers and herders while also helping the long-term economic viability of both the farming and herding communities. We are mindful of the short-term dislocation this might cause but are also mindful that this position is in the best interests of all parties concerned. We, therefore, recommend that the federal and state governments cooperate fully with each other to enact the necessary measures to encourage this more effective and modern method of cattle-rearing so that both farmers and herders can pursue their livelihoods with greater productivity and in a more cooperative relationship that minimizes the friction between these two important pillars of our agricultural economy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and his Ekiti State counterpart, Dr Kayode Fayemi, were not at the meeting.\n\nEfforts to speak to Akeredolu\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Olabode Olatunde, and the state Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, were not successful.\n\nBut the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Kayode Fayemi on Public Communication, Segun Dipe, said he did not know the governor\u2019s itinerary.\n\nDipe said, \u201cI honestly will not know whether he was at the meeting or not.\u201d\n\nA source close to the governors said they did not attend the meeting because it was anchored on the ambition of an individual.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe cannot be part of such meeting which was held under the guise of somebody\u2019s ambition when the country is facing myriad of crises.\u201d\n\nBut Adebayo was said to have apologised on behalf of Akeredolu and Fayemi, saying they had other previous scheduled engagements.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Tunde Oso\n\nIn Everybody Don Kolomental, author, Tolu Akinyemi states that everyone deals with mental health struggles and could be \u201ca god in a human body\u201d, as he explores themes of spirituality, divinity and the enormous power that we possess while we traverse this earthly passage, in the collection of poems.\n\nAkinyemi weaves his exuberant latest collection of poems around the themes of depression and mental health problems. With candour and verve, he captures the pain of living with mental illness in \u201cMental,\u201d as he writes: \u201cHow do I find healing in tranquillity? Without being judged through a blurry lens.\u201d \u201cMood Swings\u201d explores the protagonist\u2019s struggle with a maniac and depressive phases that relentlessly wreak havocs in their life.\n\n\u201cTherapy\u201d examines the stigma associated with seeking help for mental health problems. These poems are unforgiving in their portrayal of mental health sufferings (\u201cCheckmate,\u201d \u201cBurning\u201d), envy and bitterness (\u201cBest Friends,\u201d \u201cBitterness\u201d), and violence (\u201cA Single Story\u201d); yet there is hope and self-awareness, a wish to get out of depression and do better, even if it feels like the odds are stacked against you (\u201cNo Pity,\u201d Self-Doubt,\u201d \u201cMy Girls,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Snap It yet\u201d).\n\nIn \u201cPeople of the World,\u201d the protagonist contemplates the futility of passing friendships and fleeting attachments. \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d exudes melancholy as the protagonist remembers a long-dead friend. Crafted on similar lines, \u201cConversation with the Dead\u201d is replete with longing. \u201cTherapist in Need of Therapy\u201d studies mental health professionals\u2019 struggles with mental illnesses.\n\nThe book\u2019s title poem, \u201cEveryday Don Kolomental\u201d conveys resolve while maintaining a sort of crude optimism. The final poem, \u201cThe Tenth Chapter\u201d is a congratulatory nod to self. Most poems suggest despair, sadness, and loneliness, that accompany depression, but moments of hope permeate others, making sure the overall mood never stays dark for long. This is an impressive addition to Akinyemi\u2019s compelling body of work.\n\nTolu\u2019 A.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dennis Agbo\n\nA group of Igbo Youth Vanguard for Peace and Harmonious living has asked the Southern Governors of Nigeria to consider the effect their ban on open grazing will have on herders who hitherto conducted their cattle rearing peacefully in their host communities.\n\nThe group said that the ban is capable of taking tolls on innocent herdsmen who were never part of the criminality that has in the present time become associated with cattle rearing business.\n\nSpeaking on the sideline of the recent uproar that trailed the statements of the Attorney General of Federation, AGF, and Minister for Justice, Mallam Abubakar Malami on the Southern Governors ban on open grazing, the Igbo Youths said that it beholds on the Governors to provide an enabling environment that will make it easy for herders to ranch their cows.\n\nIn a statement, on Sunday, by the Chairman and Secretary of the group, Chief Ignatius Nwaobiora and Dr Mike Efobi, respectively, the Igbo Youth Vanguard for Peace and Harmonious living said that Malami\u2019s comment on open grazing should not be misconstrued, but should serve as a wake-up call on Southern Governors to provide enabling environment for herders and other interested businessmen to invest in cow ranching.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cWe think the AGF was misunderstood. The deduction from his comment on open grazing is clear. It is not enough for Southern Governors to ban open grazing, but they should also implement the policy in a manner that would achieve the goal and at the same time improve the economic activities of the headers and other businessmen who may wish to invest in cow ranching in that part of the country.\n\n\u201cBanning open grazing without a considered enabling environment for an average herder who is used to his primitive ways of cattle rearing would seem a policy which has to take away his means of livelihood. There are good herders who are not involved in criminality and also very reasonable not to deliberately allow his cows to destroy the farmers\u2019 crops,\u201d the group said.\n\nThey suggested that in line with the disposition of the AGF, the Southern Governors should organize a dialogue with farmers and herders and communities mostly at the border towns to encourage people, based on an established standard for ranching, to acquire lands and pay to the communities.\n\nThe group further recommended that ranches should be managed by someone with resources to check illegal movements of weapon.\n\n\u201cWith this arrangement on the ground, once the cows come in, herders should be given a place to stay with their cows. Villagers can now be provided employment by engaging them to supply grasses to these herders to feed their cows at a minimal cost. Once this is done, the problem of clashes between herders and farmers would permanently end. This arrangement would also isolate the good herders from those carrying AK47 for kidnapping and other crimes.\n\n\u201cComments and sincere opinions, like that of the AGF should not be politicized or given ethnic colourations so easily, especially at this phase of our nationhood,\u201d the group said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Festus Ahon & Ochuko Akuopha, UGHELLI\n\nPRESIDENT GENERAL of Ughelli Descendants Union, UDU, Worldwide, Chief Pius Omubaye, has frowned at allegation by members of the Cow, Goat and Pig Butchers Associations that the Ovie of Ughelli, HRM Wilson Oharisi lll, asked members of the union to pay \u2018ground levy\u2019 to him before they could operate in the area.\n\nOmubaye stated this while reacting to a one-day strike action by members of the associations who accused the monarch of asking them to pay N3,000 and N2,500 for every cow, goat and other animals butchered in the market.\n\nDescribing the allegation as a false alarm aimed at intentionally painting the revered Ughelli stool in a bad light, he told members and leadership of the associations to tender an unreserved apology to the monarch and his people.\n\nHe said,: \u201cWhen we came into power, we tried to see how we could generate funds to run the union and develop the kingdom through corporate social responsibilities. And we decided to meet the butchers who are collecting ground rents from cow, pig and goat customers.\n\n\u201cThey Collect various types of money in the name of ground, rope and ladder levies. And we invited them for a meeting to let them know that we are the ground owners and that part of these moneys should be giving to us. And when it got to a critical position, we decided to meet HRM Ovie of Ughelli Kingdom to intervene and after several meetings.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cInitially they were collecting ground money N2,500 per cow, N1,000 per goat and N1,000 per pig.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Kennedy Mbele\n\nMrs Olanrewaju Tunde Adegoke is critically ill after being diagnosed with cancer. In this interview, Adegoke speaks about\n\nthe excruciating pains she is going through while soliciting help from kind-hearted Nigerians to enable her complete treatment.\n\ntake? Excerpts:\n\nHow did you know you could be having cancer and what steps did you take?\n\nI knew I stood the risk of having cancer because I had three lumps in my left breast several years ago but the moment the lumps were removed, I erased the possibility of cancer from my mind because they were examined in the laboratory and it came out to be fibroid adenoma and cyst; that was when I turned 33 years, about 13 years ago.\n\nWhat happened thereafter?\n\nThe doctor who removed the lumps told me I had nothing to fear since the lumps had been examined and confirmed to be ordinary fibroid adenoma. There were no more lumps in my breast for many years, but suddenly five months ago, I felt a hit on one of the scars and within a week I started itching at that point and within four weeks something tiny like a tumour started growing from under the scar. I was no longer comfortable at that point. Within two months, the tiny growth widened to like 2cm and this made me go to the hospital to report my feelings.\n\nAlso read:\n\nWhen and where was it confirmed that the ailment you have is cancer? And what were your immediate reactions?\n\nIn February this year, I went to the National Hospital Abuja to see my doctor and immediately a biopsy was performed and the tissues were sent to the laboratory. The result indicated that what I have is cancer. My first reaction was, why will lumps removed, tested to be ordinary fibroid adenoma and cysts suddenly turned out to be cancer after 13 years. I shed tears of sadness, but immediately I wiped the tears because God spoke to me right there in the hospital that I will survive even though I was not aware then that the financial commitments for the treatment were very high.\n\nCan you tell us about the doctor\u2019s report confirming cancer?\n\nAccording to the doctor\u2019s report, immunohistochemistry was carried out and I was diagnosed with Histologically confirmed Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the left breast, that is ER Positive, PR Negative and HER2 Neu Positive. This cancer, according to the doctor, is highly aggressive, yet highly treatable.\n\nHow is the treatment going? What stage are you in now and what is next?\n\nTreatment started immediately after cancer was confirmed to shrink the tumour and it is stage 2 cancer. Next is surgery and I will be due for it in June (next month).\n\nPeople generally believe cancer treatment can be painful and expensive. Tell us your experience?\n\nCancer treatment is actually very painful and expensive. I do not wish an enemy to have such an ailment. It is advisable to go to the hospital where there are oncologists on the ground for international standard of diagnosis and treatment otherwise it can turn out to be a mess. At the time I was diagnosed, I was given about two weeks\u2019 appointment to come back to see the oncologist at the National Hospital Abuja due to long queues of people waiting to see oncologists too. As I was waiting for the day to come, even in serious and unbearable pains, doctors went on strike. I was only left with no option other than to go to a private cancer centre here in Abuja where I commenced treatment immediately and the pains disappeared. My experience is very encouraging because the tumour has reduced in size but it will take a long time and so much money to complete treatment. Doctors say I may need about N26million to complete treatment.\n\nWhat kind of help have you received and what help do you need now going forward?\n\nI have received assistance from close friends and family members. But we have spent so far all the immediate family savings of N6.5m and we are totally out of funds now but we still have a lot way to go. I need contributions from people with compassionate hearts so that I can continue the treatment.\n\nIf you had been diagnosed with cancer earlier, do you think you would have been in this situation?\n\nMy regret is that the earlier investigation did not alert me to any danger. If I had been told from the beginning that there is the possibility of any lump or tumour coming back, I wouldn\u2019t have undergone the necessary treatment and wouldn\u2019t be in this situation now.\n\nWhat advice do you have for women generally on cancer?\n\nWomen, young and old, should go for a CT scan and mammogram at least once a year. The problem is that it is not affordable for most women and it is quite unfortunate that there is so much hardship in this country which makes it difficult for ordinary citizens to afford the costs since our healthcare services are so poor. There is no access to free CT scan or mammogram in Nigeria, and that is why we have so many women with cancer without knowing they are carrying such a deadly disease in their bodies.\n\nDo you think the government is doing enough to help cancer patients in the country? How available are facilities and personnel to treat cancer using your experience as a case study?\n\nOur government is not helping cancer patients at all. Facilities are not available, only 2 to 4 hospitals have the facilities to treat cancer patients in the country and I learnt that not all the 4 hospitals have the facilities functioning at the moment. Imagine people coming from all over Nigeria to National Hospital Abuja for radiotherapy because that is the only place where you have a functioning facility in the whole country. It is so sad that cancer patients are dying every day because of the lack of free medical care and a dearth of facilities as well.\n\nTell us your high and low points in this battle against cancer and how you overcame it.\n\nMy high point in this battle is just the fact that I live in Abuja and I have little fund to start the treatment immediately I was diagnosed. My low point in this battle is that I feel depressed thinking about funds to complete treatment. I am yet to overcome it because my treatment still has a long way to go, which is the main reason for soliciting funds from well-meaning people.\n\n* Those who wish to help Olanrewaju can donate to her cause through GTB account number 0036147987. She can be reached through telephone number 08072793318\n\nVanguard Newes Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "Northern youths split over Malami\u2019s opposition to open grazing ban",
          "text": "From Sola Ojo, Kaduna; Billy Graham Abel, Yola; Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe opposition of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to the recent ban on open grazing by the southern governors in their respective States, appear to have torn the Northern youths apart.\n\nMalami had declared the southern governors\u2019 decision \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 and likened the ban on open grazing to banning the sales of motor spare parts by the Igbo in the North, a statement that has received wide criticisms from various quarters.\n\nWhile the Arewa Youth Assembly has thrown its weight behind the AGF, the Northern Leaders Youth Forum (NLYF) are in full support of the ban on open grazing, while condemning Malami\u2019s remarks.\n\nArewa Youth Assembly, in a statement by its Speaker, Mohammed Salihu Danlami, yesterday, opposed the ban on open grazing by southern governors, declaring it as unconstitutional and capable of denying some Nigerians their right to livelihood.\n\nThe group said it supported the position of Malami on open grazing.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Asaba declaration that banned the open grazing of cattle is unacceptable and we will not be abiding by the myopic unpatriotic declarations. Cattle rearing is a business that is traced back to thousands of years, with many benefits to Nigerian economy and Africa at large. The business is enjoyed not only by the cattle rearers, but the whole of humanity. Some of these benefits include a source of income to individuals, creation of jobs, boosting of the agricultural sector as well as source of nutrition.\n\n\u201cBanning open grazing is automatically putting a stop to all these benefits and termination of many people\u2019s source of livelihood. Thus, we are highly disappointed and frown at the southern governors\u2019 decision to ban open grazing. It is unfortunate and sad for such utterances to be coming from elder statesmen and the chief security officers of various states. We call on the Federal Government to swing into action, act and protect the lives and property of genuine cattle rearers going about their legal business, moving from one community to another, in search of suitable feed for their livestock in the southern part of the country.\u201d\n\nThe group called on the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, northern elites, traditional rulers, youth organisations to also checkmate the activities of southerners residing in northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMany southerners involved in so many illegal businesses, such as purchase and sell of addictive drugs, cyber crimes, proliferation of small arms among others, brought to our peaceful region. If southern governors will continue with the Asaba declaration, then we will be compelled to redefine the activities of southerners residing in the north,\u201d the group said.\n\nHowever, the Northern Leaders Youth Forum (NLYF), the umbrella body of about 42 northern youth groups, endorsed the ban on open grazing in the country and called for a national dialogue to address the country\u2019s challenges.\n\nThe NLYF made this known, yesterday, at its 27th delegates\u2019 conference, in Yola, Adamawa State.\n\nAddressing journalists in Yola, yesterday, National Chairman, NYLF, Elliot Afiyo, condemned the Justice minister, Malami, for his utterance on the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have taken time to study the communique issued by the southern governors, especially on the ban on open grazing.\n\n\u201cWe want to state, clearly, that open grazing has been the greatest threat to the environment of the northern region and, also, a major threat to security of lives and property in the entire country.\n\n\u201cWe call for the establishment of Herders Commission or Agency to cater to the needs of herders.\n\n\u201cWe, also, condemn the statement credited to the Attorney General of the Federation on the ban on open grazing.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, appeal to the President to caution his ministers and aides who, despite being in government for six years, are still having opposition mentality,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group, speaking on the unfortunate plane crash said: \u201cWe received with disbelief and astonishment, the news of a plane crash which claimed the lives of officers of the Nigerian Army and Air Force, including that of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely and honestly frown at the manner and rate of these plane crashes.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call for the immediate composition of an independent investigative panel, to ascertain the remote cause(s) of the plane crash.\u201d\n\nAfiyo also disclosed that NYLF would unveil its endorsed candidate for Nigeria\u2019s presidency in the 2023 elections, on June 5, 2021.\n\n\u2022 Malami\u2019s spare parts comment shameful- NAS\n\nMeanwhile, the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) has described the AGF\u2019s comment, in which he compared open grazing of cattle in southern Nigeria to selling of spare parts in northern Nigeria as shameful. The association said Malami drew false equivalence.\n\nThe NAS Capoon, Mr Abiola Owoaje, in a statement, titled \u201cMalami unfit to remain AGF\u201d, noted that it was disheartening that Nigeria\u2019s Chief Law Officer would be making statements capable of inciting Nigerians against one another.\n\nHe noted that selling of spare parts is clearly a legitimate business that does not habitually involve criminal trespass on other citizens\u2019 properties and the frequent threat and actuality of lethal violence which opening grazing.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis facile comparison compels us to remind Mr. Malami of the communal strife, mass murder, and massive destruction of farmlands and property, which have been the direct consequence of this archaic practice of open cattle grazing sans respect for property rights,\u201d he said.\n\nOwoaje, who pointed that Amnesty International had reported the killing of over 3,600 Nigerians, while thousands displaced from their homes and ancestral \u201csince 2016 open grazing transmogrified into criminal trespass and premeditated programmes of murderous barbarity\u201d stressed that section 41 of the Nigeria\u2019s Constitution, which guarantees freedom of movement \u201ccannot be translated into the unrestrained right to roam and trespass by animals and their herders, or their criminal proxies.\u201d\n\nHe noted given the prevailing situation in the country, people like Malami are not fit to be in the Federal Executive Council.\n\n\u201cAt a time the unity of this country has been badly shaken; and a period when impunity stalks the land, keeping Mr. Malami as the Attorney-General is a mockery of justice and fairness, and an assault on national cohesion. He should honourably resign his position, or be fired to save the Buhari government from further embarrassment.\u201d\n\n\u2022 AGF\u2019s stsatement shouldn\u2019t be misconstrued \u2013 Group\n\nRegardless, the Igbo Youth Vanguard for Peace and Harmonious Living has asked the southern governors to provide the enabling environment to make it easy for herders to ranch their cows.\n\nThe group said the recent statement by the AGF on open grazing should not be misconstrued.\n\nThe group, in a statement issued in Abuja, by the Chairman and Secretary, Chief Ignatius Nwaobiora and Dr Mike Obi, respectively, said: \u201cThe comment of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on open grazing should not be misconstrued. It should rather be a wake-up call on southern governors to provide enabling environment for herders and other interested business men to invest in cow ranching.\n\n\u201cWe think the AGF was misunderstood. The deduction from his comment on open grazing is clear. It is not enough for southern governors to ban open grazing, but they should also implement the policy in a manner that would achieve goal and at same time improve the economic activities of the headers and other business men who may wish to invest in cow ranching in that part of the country. Banning open grazing without a considered enabling environment for an average herder who is used to his primitive ways of cattle rearing would seem a policy which has taking away his means of livelihood. There are good herders who are not involved in criminality and also very reasonable not to deliberately allow his cows to destroy the farmers\u2019 crops.\u201d\n\nThe group further said in line with the disposition of Malami, the southern governors should organise a dialogue with farmers and herders and communities, mostly at the border towns, to encourage people, based on an established standard for ranching, to acquire lands and pay to the communities.\n\n\u201cIt is recommended that ranches are managed by someone with resources to check illegal movements of weapon.\n\n\u201cWith this arrangement on ground, once the cows come in, herders should be given a place to stay with their cows. Villagers can now be provided employment by engaging them to supply grasses to these herders to feed their cows at minimal cost. Once this is done, the problem of clashes between herders and farmers would permanently end. This arrangement would also isolate the good herders from those carrying AK47 for kidnapping and other crimes.\n\n\u201cComments and sincere opinions, like that of the AGF, should not be politicised or given ethnic colourations so easily, especially at this phase of our nationhood,\u201d the Igbo Youth Vanguard for Peace and Harmonious Living said.",

Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 other military officers who died in the military King Air 350 aircraft that crashed on Friday, May 21 near Kaduna Airport \u201claid down their lives in order to keep our nation safe and secure from the aggression of terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements in our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hearts are filled with sorrow for the supreme price they paid, we acknowledge with sense of gratitude to them, their selfless services to all of us in the nation. They laid down their lives in order to keep our nation safe and secure from the aggression of terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements in our nation,\u201d CAN said in a condolence letter signed by Daramola Bade Joseph, its National Secretary yesterday.\n\nThe association called on Nigerians to join them in sober prayers on May 28 to mourn \u201cthe unprecedented shedding of innocent blood in our nation and to pray to God for his quick intervention in our situation so that normalcy might return.\u201d\n\nIt commiserated with President Muhammadu Buhari, the army and families of the deceased officers and prayed God to grant them the fortitude and comfort of the Holy Spirit to bear the loss and avert such air disaster from befalling Nigeria again.\n\nCAN also called for thorough investigation to unravel the remote and immediate causes of the crashes of air force jets in recent months and called for adequate training of pilots in both the military and civil aviation sector.\n\n\u2022Ishaku, speaker condole with army, Atahiru\u2019s family\n\nTaraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, has condoled with the army and families of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 other military officers who died in the Friday plane crash.\n\nIn a statement in Jalingo, the state capital, signed by Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Bala Dan Abu, the governor described Attahiru\u2019s death and that of the officers as shocking and a big blow to families of victims, the army and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cThe death of the officers is shocking and a big blow to the families of the victims, the military and the nation at large as the late Chief of Army Staff was a highly disciplined officer who assumed the leadership of the army at a time that Nigerians craved for a change in the military strategy against insecurity in the country. The death of the Chief of Army Staff and the other victims of the crash at this time has robbed the country of their contributions to this highly sought new strategy in the war against insecurity in Nigeria,\u201d Ishaku said.\n\nHe prayed God to grant the souls of the late military officers peaceful rest and their families the fortitude to bear these monumental losses.\n\nIn a related development, Speaker of the state\u2019s House of Assembly, Prof. Joseph Albasu Kunini, also described the death of the COAS and other military officers as \u201cworrisome and heartbreaking loss\u201d.\n\nThe speaker who gave his condolence message when he interacted with journalists in Jalingo, at the weekend, said: \u201cThis is the last thing the country needed at this time. I must say that it is a dark weekend for Nigerians, the Nigerian army, but most especially for the bereaved families. If you ask me, I would say this is one crash too many. In the last three months or so, we have witnessed three military plane crashes with collateral losses. This cannot be happening.\u201d\n\n\u2022Group begs Buhari to probe plane crashes\n\nA non-governmental and non non-profit organisation, with consultative status of ECOSOC/United Nations and Centre for Convention on Democratic, incoporated in the U.S has urged the Federal Government to probe the circumstances surrounding the military plane crash in Kaduna State.\n\nJoint Chairman and President,Boards of Directors, Olufemi Aduwo, made the plea in Abuja, at the weekend\n\n\u201cWe appeal to Your Excellency to order for immediate ground of Beechcraft King Air 350i fleet and the stakeholders, manufacturer and government of Nigeria should set up a technical investigation team to investigate the remote and immediate causes of the crash and the two other Air force aircrafts crashed in February and March 2021; in Abuja and Maiduguri, respectively. The light suddenly went off for the nation on this day. But, even in the midst of darkness and pain we see hope. As we mourn, we also celebrate the extraordinary lives of these patriotic officers and men who devoted their lives and died with their boots on defending the country against external aggression and territorial integrity of our nation, our common home and future.\u201d\n\n\u2022Buhari needed 48 hours clearance to attend burial -Presidency\n\nThe Presidency has explained that President Muhammmadu Buhari needed clearance to be able to physically attend the burial of the late Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and other officers in Abuja on Saturday\n\nBuhari\u2019s absence at their burial on Saturday elicited public uproar as some accused him of lacking empathy.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, through her verified Twitter handle @Laurestar said: \u201cFor a President to be at any funeral or event outside the Presidential Villa, the event must have at least 48 hours for intelligence operatives to do surveillance and clearance before the President can go based on the security report. In insecurity parlance, funeral ceremonies are where politically exposed persons face more risks.\u201d",

          "text": "Oppose separatist agitations\n\nBy Segun James and Vanessa Obioha\n\nLeaders of the South West All Progressives Congress (APC) rose from their meeting held at the Lagos House in Marina, Lagos Sunday calling for true federalism where more power would be devolved to the states. They said such a move will strengthen democratic governance in the country.\n\nThe leaders also endorsed the position of southern governors on open grazing, saying besides reducing the tension between herders and farmers, it will minimise the friction in the country.\n\nThe APC leaders, in a nine point communiqu\u00e9 read by the former Interim National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, said: \u201cWe hold to the view that true federalism where more power and resources are allocated to the states will be an essential part in strengthening society and improving democratic governance so that we beat the present challenges but also engender durable peace and security.\n\n\u201cTrue federalism and the reallocation of resources and authority that comes with it will empower the states to solve localized issues before they spread and transform into national ones. In addition to mitigating political competition for control of the national government, greater federalism will empower grassroots economic development and political reforms that will stand as bulwarks against the terrorism and criminality now experienced in too many parts of the nation. A hallmark of this enhanced federalism will be the establishment of state police forces.\u201d\n\nAkande, who was flanked by the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Governors Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state; Gboyega Oyetola of Osun state; Lagos state Governor and host, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; former Governor of Ogun state, Chief Segun Osoba; The Minister of Trade and Industry, Otunba Niyi Adebayo; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; former Vice Chairman, APC South West, Chief Pius Akinyelure; and former Army Chief, General Alani Akinrinade, said, \u201cwe endorse the position of the Southern Governors taken at their May 11, 2021 summit in Asaba, Delta State, regarding ranching. We do so because such a decision will lessen tensions between farmers and herders while also helping the long-term economic viability of both the farming and herding communities.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful of the short-term dislocation this might cause but are also mindful that this position is in the best interests of all parties concerned. We, therefore, recommend that the federal and state governments cooperate fully with each other to enact the necessary measures to encourage this more effective and modern method of cattle-rearing so that both farmers and herders can pursue their livelihoods with greater productivity and in a more cooperative relationship that minimizes the friction between these two important pillars of our agricultural economy.\u201d\n\nWhile commiserating with President Muhammadu Buhari over the death of the Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, the communique said the South West APC leaders however expressed concern \u201cabout the state of the nation, particularly the serious security challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cThey expressrd their strong opposition to separatist agitations and hate speeches. While urging those indulging in such to desist forthwith, they renew their belief in the unity, stability and sustainability of the country.\n\n\u201cWe note with significant concern the security situation in the country. Terrorism and violent criminality threaten many areas, adversely affecting the lives and livelihoods of too many innocent and peace-loving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhile mindful of the resource and other constraints facing the nation, we urge the federal government to continue to make the necessary expenditures and allocate sufficient resources to enable the military and security agencies to tackle the difficult security challenges confronting us.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to overcome these challenges, we must do so with unity of purpose and action. The desire for peace and the chance for a prosperous and just society is universal and transcends all regional, religious or ethnic divisions. Sadly, many public figures have made statements that spark division and undermine the needed unity of purpose.\n\n\u201cWe urge government at all levels, security agencies, and public leaders across the country to do everything possible to prevent tension so that we sustain the necessary unity to defeat these challenges to our national security. All responsible Nigerians must speak and act in a manner that strengthens our common cause against these common threats to our collective peace, justice and development.\n\n\u201cWe restate our abhorrence of violence as a means to achieve either political or economic power and influence. We strongly condemn violence of any form in any part of the country, regardless of ethnic or regional identity of the perpetrators of the violence or of the victims. Government must do all it can to protect potential victims and to assist those who have previously been victimized by terrorism or widespread banditry.\u201d\n\nThey thanked traditional rulers for their important role in the polity and appealed to them to keep intervening to maintain peace and stability, even as they used \u201cthe opportunity of the meeting to urge the Federal Government to provide, through the CBN, short, medium and long term financing for states and those who may wish to set up ranches as part of the agricultural sustainability policy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Within the short time he served, he had been to Borno on multiple occasions, meeting operational commanders and troops at battle fronts. In all his interactions, he regularly motivated troops. The people of Borno thank him and all our gallant fallen heroes for their unquantifiable service to Borno and rest of Nigeria\u201d Zulum said.\n\nZulum was however joined by his predecessor, Senator Kashim Shettima, Senator Abubakar Kyari and other top dignitaries and hundreds of sympathizers for the jana\u2019iza (funeral prayers) in honour ofAttahiru.\n\nBodies of the late COAS and five others were brought by military ambulances to the national mosque for the funeral prayers that took place immediately after zuhr prayers.\n\nThe fallen officers were given the traditional 21-gun salute, amidst a mammoth crowd of sympathisers, before the interment which took place at 4:15pm.

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones.

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "text": "This might be it!\n\nFinally, a financial app that considers the lifestyle of regular people, the harsh economic situation in the country, and everyday financial challenges that influence how people borrow, save or invest.\n\nCan we pique your interest?\n\nLet\u2019s start with savings. Some of us have been saving from when we were kids and it was cool to have a piggybank. Beyond piggybanks and other traditional ways of saving like Esusu, it has become common to save with banks and almost everyone has a savings account. Some even have up to three. But what value do you get from those savings accounts or the Esusu contribution? How much interest do you earn from them in a month?. Probably nothing. In most cases, you even pay more on annoying charges. The good news is that savings has evolved. It\u2019s no longer enough to just keep money anywhere and call it savings. Financial apps like Branch, PiggyVest and Kuda have shown that your savings can be an investment which allows you to earn actual interest, no matter how small. People hardly have enough to money to meet their financial needs and this clearly influences the service features on majority of these financial apps.\n\nHowever, they all differ in the interest they offer on their platforms. If you\u2019re familiar with all the top ones, a quick research will show you that while several savings and investment apps offer sumptuous interest rates with up to 15% per annum being the highest, Branch sets the pace with 20% interest rate per annum. Branch is also the only financial app so far that offers flexible withdrawals, which means your money doesn\u2019t have to be locked for any minimum duration. Afterall, we save for rainy days, don\u2019t we? So if the rainy day comes you should have access to your money.\n\nAll the things your bank won\u2019t do.\n\nHere are a few more things that sets Branch apart from both your regular banking and other financial apps.\n\nAt your beck and call, for a cost: Trust your bank to be on top of their game when they send you notifications but obviously at a cost. Branch has no such thing as SMS alert fees.\n\nPay, to pay bills: Every month, you pay all sorts of bills like DSTV and PHCN on your regular financial apps and banking apps. But of course, it always comes at a cost \u2013 N100 here, N50 there. Some banks even say this cost is negligible, but everyone knows if you stack up enough N100 notes, you\u2019ll eventually have enough to do something that is not negligible. Again, with Branch, this service is free!\n\nTransfer fees: How many transfers have you made in the last month alone? How many did you make last year? If you add up all the charges you pay for making transfers in a month, you can at least buy airtime or data with it. If you add up all the cost for a year, who knows what you can buy with it. The point is, in the end, all these costs and charges add up to something. So if you can make unlimited transfers for free, why would you rather pay for it? Branch doesn\u2019t think you should pay for it though.\n\nAnybody home? \u2013 Customer service with most banks would leave a sour taste in your mouth. They will put you hold. They will tell you the problem can\u2019t be solved remotely and you should go to a branch near you. When you get to the bank branch, you\u2019ll be in a queue, then you\u2019ll fill forms. Finally, they\u2019ll tell you to go wait at home that it will be done in a few days. That doesn\u2019t happen with Branch. Branch customer service team is available 24/7 and all problems are resolved in-app.\n\nBonus programs: Most financial apps have some form of bonus program but none of them is like Branch. Branch has a second-generation referral system that makes referrals a win-win for all parties. Whereas other financial apps pay one-time bonuses for referrals, Branch pays you N500 when friends you refer pay up their first loan. The friends you invited also earn N500. In addition, you earn N50 for every deposit of N300 and above. How cool is that?\n\nThe money part: Branch gives you up to N500,000 in loans within seconds of applying on the app. No collateral or paperwork required. Start with small loan amounts and get higher amounts the more you repay.\n\nClearly, Branch offers you more flexibility and a lot more profit than other financial apps. So if you\u2019ve been suffering from poor financial services, it\u2019s time to make a switch. Branch can be downloaded on the Google Play Store",

TradeDepot\u2019s mission is to consolidate this fragmented informal\n\nretail supply chain, connect the world\u2019s top consumer goods manufacturers to micro retailers on the streets of Africa\u2019s cities and support the informal retail sector with inventory financing to scale and grow. Today, TradeDepot, through its ShopTopUp platform, digitally and seamlessly plugs the gap in informal retail by providing flexible and affordable loans to its retailers to buy more goods at the best prices, scale their businesses and generate more revenue.\n\nAbout Endeavor\n\nEstablished in 1997, Endeavor is a mission-driven, global organization leading the high-impact entrepreneurship movement.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nBitnob is a Nigerian startup that lets users buy, save and invest in bitcoin. Users can access these features and much more through the mobile app that\u2019s available for Android iOS.\n\nBitnob offers a ton of other options, like loans, Dollar-Cost-Averaging plans, and many much more. At first glance, the Bitnob app feels fantastic, with a simple UI and easy-to-find functions. But how does it handle the functions that truly matter, like buying BTC and saving?\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out.\n\nGetting started with Bitnob\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the onboarding process\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a new account on Bitnob\n\nSetting up your Bitnob app begins with installing it from your app store. When you open it for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create an account. Unlike many other apps, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you just sign up with an email and get on with it.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll need to supply your first name and last name. Your first name will be used to create a username that\u2019s unique to you (more on the username later.)\n\nYou\u2019ll also provide your phone number and receive an OTP for verification. Once that\u2019s clear, you can create a secure password and five-number transaction pin.\n\nI love this part because the app makes you choose something secure and up to 8 characters. Once you have all this dialed-in, you can get to the fun part.\n\nDepositing money on Bitnob\n\nAs an app for savings and investment, I expected Bitnob\u2019s deposit system to be as simple as inputting debit card information. Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nIf you remember, the topic has been complicated in Nigeria since the CBN has ordered banks to close accounts of crypto traders back in February. To protect its users, Bitnob doesn\u2019t let you buy BTC straight from your bank account.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll first buy a recharge voucher from Ovarr. One thing I love is that the cards are sold in bundles ranging from $10 to $500. This way, users can buy within their financial limits.\n\nTo buy the voucher, you have to fill in your user information and then pay using a debit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter buying the voucher, you\u2019ll get a pin that you can paste into Bitnob to activate your purchase.\n\nSo while the process is slightly longer than I expected, it works all the same.\n\nWithdrawals on Bitnob\n\nWithdrawals aren\u2019t quite as tedious, and you can complete them in a few short steps.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need to select \u2018withdraw\u2019 in the plan of your choice. You can withdraw to a BTC wallet or a USD wallet. To get cash in my local bank account, I had to first select a USD wallet and then send the cash to my local account.\n\nYou can send BTC to your blockchain wallet by selecting \u2018send\u2019 and pasting the BTC address in the provided field. You can also use the QR code scanner instead of pasting the BTC address.\n\nSending BTC to another user follows this same procedure. You simply paste their address or scan their Bitnob BTC wallet address.\n\nCustomization options\n\nYou can make changes to your Bitnob account through the \u2018account\u2019 icon. From here, you can change your name and user name, and fill in next of kin details,\n\nYou can also add your bank accounts and mobile money accounts here. I love that you get to choose between the two options.\n\nBitnob Features\n\nNow we get into the staple features of Bitnob\n\nAccessing loans\n\nBitnob offers Nobcredit, which is an awesome way for users to get quick cash while still HODLing their BTC. You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

You can access Nobcredit from the app\u2019s home page, and the process is quite quick.\n\nThe loan amount you get depends on how much BTC you have as collateral. You can then pay back before the tenure expires to reclaim your BTC.\n\nYour interest rate is calculated based on your loan-to-value ratio, or the amount of collateral you have. Average rates are between 16 and 17.2%, and loan tenures range between 3 and 12 months.\n\nI love that you can check your interest rate and collateral volume using the in-app loan calculator. This makes sure that you have all the information you need before moving forward.\n\nPlans\n\nOne of Bitnob\u2019s main features is that you can create a savings plan for your BTC. You can name the plan, choose the amount you want to save in USD, and pick the frequency of savings. The available options are daily, weekly, and monthly.\n\nYou can also select a maximum duration for the lock. WIthdrawing before the maturity date will earn you a 3% penalty. The penalty is one more reason to keep saving.\n\nThe plans work based on the concept of Dollar-Cost-Averaging, which simply allows you to invest large sums over a period. The longer your investment tenure and the more often you make deposits, the bigger your overall portfolio.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only fund your plan with money from your USD wallet, which means you\u2019ll have to buy vouchers that cover your savings amount.\n\nUsers can create as many plans as they need, and adjust the deposit amount, frequency, and maturity date for a bigger payout.\n\nReferrals\n\nBitnob allows you to earn up to $1,000 via referrals alone. And it\u2019s quite easy to get started because you get a referral code immediately when you sign up. You can copy the code right from the home screen.\n\nWhen a new user signs up with your referral code, you get a small USD reward based on how much your referral deposits. I love the referral system because it\u2019s as easy as sending your code to whoever you invite.\n\nSecurity and Support\n\nHow does Bitnob handle security and customer care?\n\nReaching customer care\n\nHave you ever tried to reach customer care only to be kept on hold for an unreasonable amount of time? I loved that Bitnob went a different route by allowing you to live chat with customer care right in the app.\n\nI got a response within 2 minutes (I actually checked) of sending the message which was quite impressive. You can also access the FAQs section from within the app.\n\nSecurity features\n\nIf you have trouble remembering your passwords don\u2019t worry. Bitnob automatically activates fingerprint login for every user with a biometric-enabled device. If you\u2019d rather log in old school, you can turn this feature off in the accounts tab.\n\nOne cool but annoying security feature is that the app logs you out every time your screen goes to sleep. I found this quite irritating because I use the app a lot and I have to log in every few seconds.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t stay mad because it protects my BTC even more. Once my screen turns off, no one can access or even see my funds, which makes me feel good.\n\nOther standard security features also apply. For example, you can\u2019t change passwords unless you provide the old password.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOverall, the Bitnob app delivers an impressive performance. My only reservation is the convoluted process associated with depositing. However, it\u2019s completely understandable given the current financial laws.\n\nBefore you go, I wanted to tell you one quirky thing I found about the app. It displays these short but interesting messages on the login page and your dashboard, and they really add character to the app. Two of my favourite are \u2018we care about you,\u2019 and \u2018my favorite human, cheer up.\u2019 Be sure to look out for these when you download the app.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Does the Nigerian government want safety or surveillance with its new IMEI policy?",
          "text": "From July 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) will require Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralised Equipment Identity Register.\n\nIn May 2021, the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy released a Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Registration (PDF) that requires Nigerians to submit their IMEI numbers to a Centralized Equipment Identity Register (CEIR), otherwise known as Device Management System (DMS), which the NCC would manage.\n\nSome of the reasons given for the Ministry\u2019s action include curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market, discouraging mobile phone theft, enhancing national security, protecting consumer interest, increasing revenue generation for the government, reducing the rate of kidnapping, mitigating the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitating the blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices.\n\nThis move follows the Nigerian government\u2019s previous initiatives for digital identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that in December 2020, the Nigerian government released a statement mandating all Nigerians to obtain their National Identification Number (NIN). Predictably, there was a rush as Nigerians all over the country attempted to get their NIN before the deadline at the end of 2020.\n\nThe directive caused a massive uproar among Nigerians because it was given in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps as a result of that, the deadline was moved to February 2021. Since then, it has been moved thrice, with the new deadline now June 30, 2021.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s IMEI policy will definitely have major implications for the entire nation if implemented.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique number used to identify a mobile phone. It is usually found inside the battery compartment of most phones but can also be gotten by dialling *#06#. With an IMEI number, a phone can be tracked, but more than that, it can also be used for identity theft and even cloning a phone.\n\nEver since the news broke, there has been an understandable outcry, with IMEI and Isa Pantami trending on Twitter.\n\nHowever, while the government requires Nigerians to share this data, they do not have to, as your IMEI is part of the data transmitted to your network operator as soon as you make a call, use data, or send a text.\n\nThis information is rarely ever used beyond providing the details that your phone needs to work. However, security operatives can use it in the case of theft or while tracking terrorist activity.\n\nA few countries, including Azerbaijan, India, Cambodia, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Lebanon, already have some form of this database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a phone owner possesses their IMEI number, they could provide law enforcement agencies with this information to track these phones if they are stolen.\n\nWhile the reasons given by the government for this new policy appear genuine at first glance, Nigerians are bothered about the possible ways the government can exploit this data.\n\nAn article on The Insider details how the Saudi government uses IMEI numbers to track the location of women who have run away from abusive partners. Most of the doubts expressed regarding the use of this information for surveillance.\n\nIt has not always been used negatively. The ITU reports that implementing this in Great Britain and Turkey resulted in a reduction in mobile phone theft while it increased the number of legally imported mobile devices in Ukraine by 95%, as well as increasing revenues from the import of mobile devices\n\nAccording to a data privacy expert, some of the questions that should be asked include whether there are sufficient safeguards in the absence of a comprehensive data protection law. Also, is the government going to be transparent about its use of this data and what happens in the case of a violation?\n\nOne must remember that with the government mandating Nigerians to link their SIM cards to the NIN, the government already has rich insights into the activities of its citizens. Adding IMEI data to this would mean that they can also get real-time location data on anyone.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights history, Nigerians may be right to be suspicious about the motives behind this policy.\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "MPC Meeting Set to Kick-Off On Monday\n\nIn the coming week, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will hold its third set of meetings for the year on Monday and Tuesday (24th and 25th of May, 2021).\n\nThe Committee is expected to review the domestic and external macroeconomic conditions and financial markets developments since its last meeting in March and provide forward guidance on how it intends to balance the competing goals of price and exchange rate stability.\n\nRead Also: FX, inflation possible consideration for a \u2018hold\u2019 as MPC meets Monday\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the committee is expected to keep the monetary policy parameters unchanged and affirm the continued adoption of its secondary \u201ctoolbox\u201d in addressing the imbalance in the external account and restoring macroeconomic stability.\n\nThe NBS release calendar is as follows:\n\n\u00b7 Tuesday 25th May, 2021: Company Income Tax (Q1 2021)\n\n\u00b7 Thursday 27th May, 2021: Pension Asset and Membership Data (Q1 2021)\n\n\u00b7 Friday 28th May, 2021: Telecoms Data: Voice and Internet per State, Porting and Tariff Information (Q1 2021).\n\nOIL PRICES UNAFFECTED DESPITE 3-DAY PLUNGE\n\nOil prices nudged up on Friday, recovering from three days of losses as investors braced for the return of Iranian crude supplies after officials said Iran and world powers made progress on talks to revive a 2015 nuclear deal. Brent had a weekly decline of -2.76%. However, Brent crude oil futures are currently up 1.86%, trading at $66.32 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate is currently up 2.20% trading at $63.30.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva said subsidy on petrol will soon be withdrawn and the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill will not go beyond June.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Nigeria Governors Forum okay full deregulation of petrol (with the fuel selling between N380 and N408.5 per litre), wants the three refineries privatised after rehabilitation, and recommended the purchase of 113 buses to cushion the likely effects of the price increase.\n\nData from the Nigerian Oil Spill Monitor and Response Agency (NOSDRA) using a satellite-powered tracker showed that out of the 3363.03 barrels of oil spilled recorded from December 2020 through April 2021, 3140.10 barrels, representing a staggering 93.4 per cent, were from oil theft.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to dip marginally as Iranian oil is set to flood the market as the country and world powers make progress in a nuclear deal.\n\nDATA FROM KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ALTER GOLD PRICES\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, pressured by the dollar and U.S. treasury yields.\n\nThe precious metal recorded significant losses at the last trading session of the week as an improvement in the global economic outlook strengthened investors\u2019 risk appetite.\n\nGold futures plunged by 0.38% to $1,874.75 an ounce. The weaker greenback that often moves inversely to gold, inched down today, thereby capping the precious metal\u2019s losses. Gold bugs seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach amid solid economic reports from key international markets that include the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as investors increased their buying pressures on riskier assets like global equities.\n\nRecent price action, however, suggests gold bugs are pretty much in play, with the bullion assets springing above $1,850 an ounce amid signs of inflationary pressures. Market experts envisage that a break above $1,900 an ounce is still in the works on the bias that the precious metal is supported by \u201cirrational\u201d behaviour in response to a COVID-19-stressed global economy that threatens the value of fiat currencies.\n\nIn addition, gold traders seem to keep some of their bullish bets amid the reality that postulates COVID-19 is still far from being under control, triggering a flocking back to the safe-haven asset, despite the significant progress that was made in the past few months, and several COVID-19 vaccines already in the market.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nCocoa prices are expected to decline in the coming week as a result of weak demand from Europe. Sugar prices on the other hand, are expected to rise next week due to the sugar supply shortage in Brazil. Corn prices are also expected to be bullish next week as a result of continued demand from China.\n\nIn the previous week, Cocoa prices and sugar prices dipped by -1.57% and -1.83% respectively. However, Corn prices climbed by 1.49% Week on Week (W-o-W).\n\nMORE OF THE SAME FOR THE NAIRA\n\nOverall, it was a bearish market for the Naira both at the official window and BDC window this week.\n\nOn a W-o-W basis, the Naira remained flat against the dollar and the Euro at the BDC window, however, against the Pound it was bearish. It depreciated against the British Pound by -0.44%, closing at \u00a31/N680 at the BDC window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira was depreciated marginally by -0.08% at the end of the week. The Naira closed the week at $/N412.0 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N410.71.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold.\n\nMONEY MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nFunding rates are expected to trend in double digits in the coming week.\n\nFunding rates declined at the start of the previous week which was supported by system liquidity. Funding rates fell significantly at the close of the week. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 16.50% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 17.0% indicating a Week-on-Week (W-o-W) decline of -38.62% for OBB and -41.14% for O/N rates.\n\nTREASURY BILLS MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nActivity in the treasury bills market is expected to remain subdued in the coming week as system liquidity remains relatively tight.\n\nThe Nigerian Treasury Bills market continued its bearish sentiment for most of the previous week, however, the sentiments improved slightly at the end of the week. At the close of the week, the average benchmark yield for T-bills rose by +13.68% to close at 5.76% while OMO bills rose by +7.10% W-o-W to close at 8.62%. Yield for Special bills rose significantly by +17.80% W-o-W to close at 8.87%.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME FOR THE FGN BOND AND EUROBOND MARKET\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to remain soft in the absence of any trigger in the week ahead.\n\nThe Bond market started the previous week on a relatively quiet note as attention was drawn to the Bond auction. At the close of the week, the market was bearish with selling interest seen majorly at the short end of the curve. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.52% for the week which increased W-o-W by +4.61%.\n\nThe Eurobond market traded on a relatively weak note last week with sell-off seen across all SSA papers following the rise in US treasury yields coupled with a decline in crude oil prices. The average benchmark yield closed at 6.17% at the end of the week increasing marginally W-o-W by +0.82%.\n\nNIGERIAN CAPITAL MARKET OUTLOOK\n\nIn the coming week, we expect a likelihood of undulating trading sessions during the week. Bargain hunting is also expected as the profit taking run would create attractive entry points. However, press releases from listed companies and macroeconomic developments are likely going to impact investors\u2019 decisions. In addition, market analysts expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\nNigeria\u2019s all share index fell further last week as investors sustained their profit taking on the exchange. The Nigerian bourse closed the week negative with a decline of -2.93%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N603.48bn thus, year-to-date return deteriorated to -4.83%, while market capitalization settled at N19.98 trillion. The volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange last week declined by -20.61% and -33.09% respectively.\n\nPerformance across sectors tracked was broadly negative last week as the NSE Oil and Gas was the highest gainer for the week with +7.39% while NSE-IND recorded the highest decline with -3.34%. NSE Banking, NSE-30, NSE Insurance and NSE Consumer Goods closed the week negative with -1.53%, -1.48%, -0.74% and -0.03% respectively.\n\nTHE NIGERIAN ECONOMY IN RETROSPECT\n\nTo give an account of unremitted funds to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Senate Committee on Finance sent invites to over 60-government owned firms to start appearing before it. Prominent amongst the invited government-owned firms include the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, the Nigeria Customs Service, and the Nigerian Maritime and Safety Administration Agency. The Chairman of the Senate panel, Solomon Adeola, noted that it was important for the government to raise money to fund the budget. Furthermore, he emphasized that the full-scale investigation hearing would also enable the National Assembly to identify various leakages of government revenue that had been leading to a yearly budget deficit.\n\nIn addressing the failure of MDAs to remit proper funds to Consolidated Revenue Funds, the Fiscal Responsibility Commission reported that ministries, departments, and agencies of the Federal Government are withholding about N1.2trn. According to the Commission, about 32 listed MDAs are yet to present their audit reports to it since 2007 when it was established. Some of the affected MDAs include the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria, Bank of Agriculture, Bank of Industry, Cement Technology Institute of Nigeria, Centre for Black African Arts and Civilization, Chad Basin National Park, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, etc.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inflation declined to 18.12% in April 2021 from 18.17% in March 2021. Also, food inflation declined from 22.95% in April 2021 to 22.72% in March 2021. The rise in the food index was attributed to the increases in prices of coffee, tea and cocoa, bread and cereals, soft drinks, milk, cheese and egg, vegetable, meat, oil and fats, fish and potatoes, yam, and other tubers. Furthermore, core inflation which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce stood at 12.74% in April 021 from 12.67% recorded in March 2021. The highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, vehicle spare parts, hairdressing salons, and personal grooming establishments, garments, furniture and furnishing, medical services, shoes, and other wears, motor cars, major household goods, and fuel and lubricants for personal transport equipment.\n\nThe House of Representatives at the plenary on Wednesday resolved to investigate the alleged abandonment of the Eastern Rail Line, the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri section after the Federal Government awarded the reconstruction contract for N72.34bn. It was noted that the panel would also confirm the status of the entire contracts awarded for the 1443km Eastern Railway Line for approximately N72.34bn to Messrs Esser Contracting and Industry Company (Turkey), CGGC Global Projects Nigeria Limited, and Lingo Nigeria Limited (in association with Strasky Husty and Partners Ltd of Czech Republic).",

          "text": "The sing song in Nigeria nowadays is the call for implementation of separation of powers as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nMany observers say that it appears that the Executive arm has swallowed up the judiciary and legislative arms, a sad development which has continued to frustrate governance.\n\nPerhaps, at no other time since the return of the country to civil rule in 1999 has Nigerians experienced a total absence of the legislature in governance than now.\n\nThe bicameral National Assembly, made up of 109 Senate members and 360 members of the House of Representatives, has sold itself to the Executive under the control of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAt best, it can be said that the federal legislature is non-existent in Nigeria as the 9th Assembly has proven to be a rubber stamp of the Executive.\n\nThe legislative house is now ruled by primordial sentiment. Religion, ethnicity, and party affiliation have ruined the chambers.\n\nIn the United States of America, where Nigeria copied its version of presidential system, the Senate president and Speaker of the House of Representatives work independent of the executive arm. None is subservient to the other. They all work in harmony for the good of the country.\n\nIf it were not for strong institutions in place, the general election in the US last year would have flopped. But National Assembly played their role; the electoral body played its role appropriately and the country was saved from going into crisis.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, the nation\u2019s Judiciary and National Assembly are extension of the Executive. They are tied to the apron string of the Executive. They have no mind of their own.\n\nWhen the Senate President or Speaker goes to see the President and they kneel down to greet the President, almost fidgeting, it means they do not know their job and their powers. There is nothing like father-son relationship when it comes to separation of powers. They are supposed to be a check on the Executive.\n\nOn a number of occasions, the National Assembly had discussed the seriousness of the insecurity situation in the country. Suggestions had also been made to summon the President, but that has not happened, because a greater number of the legislature, because they are of the same party, religion or ethnic leaning with the President, they shut down the plan.\n\nSome members of the National Assembly had also called for the impeachment of the president on the ground of incompetence, but that has also been shut down.\n\nRecently, Senator Smart Adeyemi (APC-Kogi) cried on the floor of the Senate while speaking on the worsening security situation in the country, and he urged his colleagues to take a drastic action by calling the President\u2019s attention to a menace that he noted was threatening the lives of every citizen. But he was not taken seriously by fellow party members.\n\nA National Assembly that worth its salt protects the interest of the masses by prevailing on the Executive to do what is right. But Nigeria\u2019s case is different as the federal legislators collude with the Executive to drive long nail into the head of citizens, as it were.\n\nThe National Assembly allows the Executive to run rough shod over the citizens. Incessant increase in pump price of fuel amid biting poverty in the land is part of government\u2019s insensitivity. Increasing electricity tariff without commensurate supply of power is insensitive. Many companies are not functioning optimally; the healthcare system has collapsed, unemployment rate has become scandalous, and government pays deaf ear to people\u2019s plight. In all of these, the federal legislators are not restraining the Executive even with the level of hardship in the country.\n\nThe Federal Government is not complete without the National Assembly. In other words, the executive, and the judicial arms, whose powers are vested by the Constitution of Nigeria in the National Assembly, cannot function well without the check and balances provided by the legislature. But this is missing, in the real sense of the word.\n\nA clear instance of primordial sentiment featured on the floor of the House of Representatives Thursday, when Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the House, who presided over the plenary, shut down a motion by Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers) to call the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami to order over his comments on the ban on open grazing by Southern Governors.\n\nWase, who was intolerant of the motion, was said to have shouted down his colleague who was irked by Malami\u2019s comments and raised a point of order (Order 6 of House Rules Book) at the plenary, accusing the Attorney-General of the Federation of making inciting comments.\n\nWase reportedly shouted: \u201dThe order which you are bringing this matter is wrong. It\u2019s either you bring it as a full motion but coming under matters of privilege is wrong so take your seat.\u201d\n\nIt was the same Wase who resisted Mark Gbillah, a Tiv lawmaker from Benue State in March from raising a motion on behalf of Tiv indigenes in the diaspora, who were condemning the rate of killing in their state and displacement of their people from their ancestral land.\n\nWase vehemently resisted Gbillah and rejected their petition against the Federal Government of the alleged takeover of their ancestral lands.\n\nSuch actions by Wase do not convey that elected members have the right to air their views in the chambers, just because the principal officers are being sentimental or trying to please some individuals or groups.\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a politician and political analyst, decried the rubber stamp status of the legislature in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor Nigeria to effectively function as a country, there must be full separation of powers, amongst the Executive, Legislators and the Judiciary as demanded by the 1999 constitution, which is still subject to review and amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Executive arm both at the Federal and State has formed the habit of using the legislators as rubber stamp in carrying out their agenda, which in most cases do not reflect the wishes of their constituencies.\u201d\n\nA number of issues of national importance that affected the lives of Nigerians have been glossed over by the National Assembly.\n\nNigerians are expecting that there should be total independence of the National Assembly, but that is not the case as their refusal to play their oversight role on the Executive, has worsened the bad governance by the Buhari administration, leaving the nation\u2019s economy in tatters.\n\n\u201cNigerians have the right to think that there is a predetermined position on the proposed constitution amendment process for instance, because the federal legislators have not acted like they have the mind of their own since they came into power,\u201d Adeoye said.\n\n\u201cVery worrisome is the fact that, they tend to do esprit de corps as APC members than to show loyalty and concern for the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThis is where I will call on all opposition Senators and Reps members in the PDP and others to stand to be counted and not allow anything that will further polarise the country,\u201d he added.\n\nHe further urged Nigerian voters to work hard in 2023, to ensure that credible people and of robust knowledge are voted from all the constituencies across Nigeria to the National Assembly to avoid a situation where loyalty will be to the President rather than to the country.\n\nKunle Okunola, a political analyst, said it was quite unfortunate that the National Assembly that ought to seriously serve as a check on the President and the entire executive operates like a rubber stamp arm of the government.\n\n\u201cAlthough the NASS in a presidential system work in harmony with the Executive for the progress of the country, that should not be taken to a level that it becomes unhealthy for the development of the country. The separation of powers provision must be adhered to,\u201d Okunola said.\n\nHe further said that, \u201cBlind loyalty to the president is immoral, unconstitutional and illegitimate because their loyalty should be to the people who elected them to represent their interest.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly\u2019s excessive loyalty to the President is inimical to the development of the country and so, they need to work more for people\u2019s interest than the president\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nBut Ahmed Lawan, Senate president, does not believe the 9th Assembly under his leadership has missed the mark.\n\nSpeaking at an event recently, Lawan said: \u201cThis relationship is misunderstood by many. Some, out of mischief, describe the National Assembly as a rubber stamp, some out of misunderstanding. For us, what is utmost in our minds in the ninth Assembly is: how do we work with the executive to make Nigeria better? If the price to pay is the names that we get, then let it be the price, because we believe that Nigerians deserve better service, better infrastructure development in the country and it is difficult if not impossible in this country or indeed in any democracy without understanding and harmony in the way and manner the two arms of government work.\u201d",

John Ojikutu, therefore, identified some gaps that could have caused the recent plane crashes.\n\nOjikutu said that the nation\u2019s airports had had some deficiencies in terms of safety equipment over the years that might have led to crashes.\n\nHe said that weather had been one of the major causes of most of the crashes in the country, such as the ADC and Sosoliso crashes in 2005 and 2006.\n\nOn the crash of NAF Beachcraft that killed the Chief of Army Staff and 10 others, he said that the statement by the Chief of Defence Staff indicated that inclement weather was responsible.\n\nHe observed that one of the problems that led to the accidents in 2005, 2006 was also as a result of inclement weather.\n\n\u201cThat was the thing that caused the crash of ADC in Abuja and Sosoliso in Port Harcourt and other one like that.\n\n\u201cIt was the wind shear and the government put in money to install wind shear system in all international airports.\n\n\u201cI think if I am not making mistake, somewhere along he line, all airports were installed with wind shear system.\n\n\u201cThe question I keep asking everyday is do we have proper periodic maintenance of these equipment because these are seasonal incidents that have to do with weather.\n\n\u201cThis happens at low level and it happens when you are about to land or about to take off along the approach path.\n\n\u201cI also read that the said aircraft was diverted from military to civilian airport because there must have been a weather issue and I am sure that military airport there has wind shear system.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that are we sure the wind shear system in Kaduna airport is working,?\u201d he asked.\n\nWind shear, sometimes referred to as wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere.\n\nOjikutu said that the recent bird strike incidents was also worrisome.\n\nHe alleged that equipment were procured for bird strike to some airports, especially in Lagos sometimes in 2006 or 2007.\n\nHe alleged further that there were concerns about whether or not those equipment were still functional.\n\nThe expert also spoke on the need for proper oversight on the air worthiness of aircraft and safety of the airport where aircraft are landing.\n\nBut a security expert, Dr Kabir Adamu, Managing Director, Beacon Consulting Ltd. Abuja, pleaded with the federal government to evaluate the nation\u2019s airport and it fleets to ascertain their current state.\n\nAdamu noted that it had become imperative due to the incessant plane crashes in the country.\n\nThe expert decried the current state of the nation\u2019s airports, particularly the fleets and the condition of service for the pilots.\n\nAccording to him, once the evaluation is carried out, then the authorities or the agencies involved can actually know the actual cause of the frequent crashes.\n\n\u201cWith this, the authority involved can now come to the conclusion whether the challenges need to be addressed immediately, or to ground all the aircraft.\n\n\u201cHowever, globally, there are three or four reasons that are attributed to air crashes in any part of the world.\n\n\u201cIt can be mechanical, human error, act of nature and shot down as a result of hostile activities.\n\n\u201cThis is usually associated with conflict areas where there malicious act of certain individual or group.\n\n\u201cSo, whether the regulatory body released report or not, these four areas are the likely consequences.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, only a thorough investigation will reveal which of these is more frequent in the country because we do not have the technology to determine what the reasons are immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expert recalled that in 2021 alone, we had three crashes associated with the military on Feb, 27, March 31 and the third one was in May 21.\n\n\u201cHowever, given the frequency, it is absolutely important that an investigation is conducted.\n\n\u201cIf the reason is poor maintenance, then it means it is an internal thing and the military needs to deal with that urgently.\n\n\u201cIf on the other hand, it is something that has to do with the pilots\u2019 capabilities, then that should be taken up by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF).\n\n\u201cAt the same time, if it is maintenance, then what type of equipment is there at the airport and are they of international standard\u201d?\n\nHe, however, expressed optimism that if the country could carry out a thorough evaluation of the airports and its fleets, it would go a long way in addressing the frequent air crashes in the country.\n\nSimilarly, Nigerians from different walks of life has urged the government to invest more on training and retraining of the nation\u2019s pilots locally and internationally, to check plane crashes.\n\nIn reactions to Friday\u2019s aircrash that claimed the lives of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen.

This is not good for the military.\n\n\u201cThe implication is very bad concerning the military, I think this is the time to look inward and find out what is happening to our men, what is happening concerning our equipment; could this be man-made error, equipment error or engine fault.\n\n\u201dThere is need too, to invest more in the training of our men, locally and internationally.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring in the people to train them, or send them outside the country, for more exposure and training.\n\n\u201cLet us engage in training the trainers for our men.\n\n\u201cAlso, we need to regularly evaluate the fitness of our pilots, psychologically and mentally,\u201d he said.\n\nMakinde stated that the development was particularly sad because the country has lost its very best hands, who were at the peak of their careers.\n\n\u201cWe have lost our Chief of Army Staff, who was contributing a lot to the fight against the insurgency, he had been doing a lot since he assumed office,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his view, Mr Ovie Edomi, Publisher and Editor-In-Chief, South South International Magazine, urged the federal government to ensure recruitment of sound professionals in air travel.\n\n\u201cFor a country\u2019s military to experience three air clashes in three months, it implies that the military high command needs to look at so many things including the theory of conspiracy, lack of maintenance and inadequate funding.\n\n\u201cThough, l am not an aviation expert, l know from my years of flying that a twin-engine aircraft is not designed to just fail and crash.\n\n\u201dThey should check their fuel suppliers and maintenance engineers thoroughly,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Mr Mohammed Sodipo, Chairman Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Badagry Chapter, said \u201cthe solution is simple; all the country needs is justice, equality and fairness.\n\n\u201dWe need an incorruptible and courageous judicial system.\n\n\u201cWe also need upright and selfless leaders, as well as orientation of the public on good leadership and followership\u201d.\n\n_______________________________\n\nA News Analysis by News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n...",

These precautionary measures are a necessary step to mitigate the risk of importation of variants of concern and break the chain of transmission to the population. Under the new measures, passengers arriving from/or that have visited any of these three countries within fourteen (14) days prior to the visit to Nigeria, are required to follow mandatory arrival quarantine and testing protocols in designated facilities.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) has, however, observed that while most of the arriving passengers dutifully observed the guidelines, some (Nigerians and foreigners) have violated them in contravention of the provisions of the CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) HEALTH REGULATIONS PROTECTION, 2021. Accordingly, the underlisted persons who arrived in Nigeria between 8th May 2021 and 15th May 2021 through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, and whose names and passport numbers are displayed, have been declared Persons of Interest (POI) on account of posing considerable danger to overall public health and for the violation of Nigeria COVID-19 travel protocol by evading the mandatory 7-day quarantine for persons arriving from restricted countries.\u201d\n\nThe government has, therefore, called on Nigerians to beware of the individuals, declaring them as persons of interest who \u201cconstitute an immediate health hazard to the society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey must therefore transport themselves safely, to the nearest state public health departments within 48hrs of this notice for immediate evaluation and call the Port Health Services, Federal Ministry of Health on 08036134672 or 08032461990 for further directions,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt further added that the concerned violators shall face regulatory sanctions including but not limited to, \u201cdisabling their travel passports for a period not less than one year; cancelation of visas or permits of foreigners that have abused our hospitality; and prosecution under the 2021 Health Protection Regulations.\u201d\n\nIt said additional list of second batch of defaulters shall be published in subsequent announcement by the committee.\n\nThe list of the Indian violators includes include; Abha Jalandhar Punjab, Ajaya Kumarmurali, Kapil Shikarpur Uttarpradesh, Chandra Dakshya, Vekwa Dinesh Kumar\n\nThatill Tijo George, Anand Amit Kumar, Puthussery John Joseph, Rathore Babu Lal, Umesh Narayan Kotian, Kabid Shauna, Ramesh Rao, Biswal Naresh, Puthussery John Joseph, Mukherjee Sobhan, Birla Mahesh Kumar, Mishra Ajay Kumar, Mishra Shlok, Mihsra Nanjari, Bendre Abhijit Bhagwan, Shah Jignesh, Dogra Sumit, Pradhan Bharat Chandra, Chandan Kumar Pandey, Kaur Armin, Francis Micky and Pokale Honaji\n\nAlso listed are, Imojire Charles Edemhenmhen, Shittu Olamide Hammed, Niguri Elizabeth T. and Oviasuyi Osage Brown, who were said to have arrived Nigeria through the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport on May 15, 2021.\n\nOthers are; Ogunsanya Omotola S., Chioma Ebeh, Gerald Chukwuma Anyadigibe Adedapo-Aisida Oluwayemisi, Obi Tochukwu Bright, Ajibade, Temitope, Abdulsalam Yusuf, Umezurike Bernard, Passos Okori, Obi John, Unaje Chuks, Eluke Aaron, Mogbonjubolataiwo, Adesina Adeola Kudirat, Adesina Abdulselem O, Onukwube Ericm, Okonkwo Chukwuebuka, Lebura Agefachuwku, Obidi Chukwud, Onyekwelu Dumebi, Anakpe Reuben, among others.",

          "title": "How LG is Championing SDGs through Environmentally Friendly Products and Collaboration",
          "text": "From LG PR Dept.\n\nAchievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is a Grand Challenge, especially for businesses. The SDGs provide a powerful aspiration for improving our world \u2013 laying out where we collectively need to go and how to get there.\n\nAs a global electronic giant, LG Electronics in its own little way has worked with the UN and other notable non-government organizations across the world to support the SDGs and reiterated its commitment to better the life for all through its products and services.\n\nIts commitment to the planet is evident in every one of its core technologies.\n\nAccording to Mr. IL Hwan Lee, President, LG Electronics, Middle East & Africa Region, LG is committed to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. \u201cAs a responsible global corporate citizen, LG Electronics is set to contributing to the achievement of the SDGs as the main goal of its social contribution activities. Our focus is on developing new innovations across Sustainability for the Community. We are committed to providing electronic products that help customers live better. To support this, we have developed a mid to long term plan themed: LGE & SDGs which we are working towards\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the last couple of years, LG has introduced a wide range of products across the areas of TVs & Home Entertainment, Kitchen, Laundry, Computers, Air Conditioning & Solar that fit into the technologies of the future with the SDGs at heart. Some of such that promote eco-friendly society include LG DUAL Inverter, LG NeON 2, LG WashTower and the CordZero M9 robot vacuum cleaner.\n\nThe revolutionary DUAL Inverter Compressor technology inside LG\u2019s air conditioners never stops adjusting speed for the perfect temperatures without wasting electricity thanks to its lower speed. The compressor reduces electricity usage by 70 percent despite cooling rooms 40 percent faster than conventional models.\n\nWhen it comes to TVs, LG\u2019s OLED self-lit technology ticks the most environmentally-friendly boxes. They have been recognized as Eco Products by SGS, especially its OLED models with no backlight meaning fewer plastic parts, less indoor air pollution and 50 percent less VOC emissions. OLED has a comparatively-high recycle rate and doesn\u2019t contain hazardous substances like cadmium and indium phosphide.\n\nLG OLED TVs are easy on the eyes and have been engineered to cause minimal eye strain via low blue light modes and zero flickering, with certification from T\u00dc V Rheinland of Germany and UL in the United States.\n\nThis year, LG Soundbars are the first of their kind to receive SGS Eco Product Certification. Many LG soundbars use polyester resin sourced from used plastic bottles or recycled plastics, one using jersey fabric sourced from recycled PET bottles \u2013 so for every unit produced, almost seven plastic battles are saved from the hazardous landfill. Even the packaging is greener! More recycled molded pulp and less EPS plastic and foam are used, and the new L-shaped packaging lets more units be transported at once for fewer trucks on the road.\n\nRecently, LG unveiled Net Zero homes to demonstrate innovations that reduce energy consumption, increase efficiency and enhance daily life. The New American Home and The New American Remodel showcased the wonders of an LG-solar-powered house filled with energy-efficient consumer electronics, appliances and air solutions.\n\nKey to the homes\u2019 environmental sustainability and appealing designs are rooftop installations of high-efficiency solar modules from residential renewable energy leader LG Business Solutions. Forty LG NeON 2 60-cell modules help power each home to support their Net Zero designs. These popular high-efficiency modules generate more power from the same amount of sunlight than lower-efficiency modules of the same size while blending in unobtrusively to the look and feel of the home\u2019s design.\n\nLG Electronics few years ago set a new direction for its social contribution efforts by reflecting the opinions of the management and key stakeholders, and identified five of the 17 SDGs as its priority. LG Electronics continuously develops and implements initiatives that contribute to achieving these 5 SDGs, and monitors the progress. The company\u2019s SDGs plan were categories into three, which are promotion of intelligent lifestyle, creation of a better society and realization of Carbon and Circular Economy.\n\nPromote Intelligent Lifestyle\n\nLG has long been committed to projects that benefit the environment. LG Carbon Fund was established in 2017 to support the development of GHGreducing technologies and solutions through the virtual cycle concept wherein all profits from LG Carbon Fund investments are funneled back into the effort to reduce greenhouse gases. LG is also an active participant in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project, which seeks to curb harmful emissions through investing technology and capital in developing countries.\n\nThe company plans to contribute to sustainable growth by implementing three commitments and nine Goals on a mid- to long-term basis. Its commitment is to promote intelligent lifestyle, create a better society and realize zero carbon and circular economy. To fulfill this commitments, LG Electronics is improving the life of its customers by providing more easy-t-use products applied with AI and future technology. The company\u2019s focus here has been on establishing intelligent living environment, pursuing healthy life for its customers and expanding green business.\n\nRealization of Carbon and Circular Economy\n\nTowards the realization of zero carbon and circular economy, the electronic giant has reduced carbon emissions in its production level by 150,000 tons by 2020 compared to the base year 2008 (i.e 1 million tons in cumulative reductions). In its mid to long term plan, LG wants to achieve 80% Green 3 Star Products by self-assessment of environmentally friendly products and achieve 95% recycle rate of waste from production sites by 2030.\n\nCreating a Better Society\n\nTo establish a sustainable supply chain, the company plans to use 100% RMAP conformant smelters by the end of this year, assess the CSR risks of all its tier 1 suppliers and expand the scope to include its tier 2 and 3 this year as well. Its plan is to establish the highest level of safety culture in the manufacturing industry (independent stage) by 2030. Achieve 100% low risk for all the production sites in CSR self-assessment; improve work efficiency and the level of employee satisfaction by achieving work and life balance through fundamental changes in work style.\n\nLG\u2019s pledge is to support stakeholders\u2019 growth and independence through partnership. Establish volunteer program in all countries where we do business by 2030. And it has evidently demonstrated its commitment to achieve these set goals with its recent products, partnerships with other organization with shared goals and advocacy across the world.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe National Examination Council (NECO) has been asked to explain how contracts worth N6.5 billion for the printing of security and non- security documents were awarded without due process.\n\nHinging on the 2017 report of Office of Auditor General of the Federation, the Senate Committee on Public Account faulted NECO on shoddy handling of two contracts worth N451 million and N6.1 billion respectively.\n\nThe report indicted the examination body of inability to present any record of approval for the contract in the first contract that cost about N451 million.\n\nLikewise did the report found NECO wanting in the award of the second contract that cost about N6.1 billion, on the ground that; quotations were not collected from three bidders, taxes were not deducted from some of the contract payments, there was no technical and financial evaluation.\n\nThe report further revealed that NECO failed to attach evidence of placement of advertisement to either payment vouchers or contract files and that the amount expended was above the threshold of the Council and the contracts were split as some contracts were awarded to same contractor with LPO.\n\nThe query reads, \u201cExamination of records and documents revealed that the Commission\u2019s Tenders Board approved the award of contract for printing of security materials in the sum of \u20a6451 million to a company in March 2017 in contravention of provisions of Federal Government Circular No.SGF/OP/I/S.3/XI/849 of 16th January, 2016 which reiterated the approved revised thresholds for service wide application, for which the Parastatal Tender Board can only exercise authority on works whose value is less than \u20a6250 million while any sum above this, is to be referred to the Ministerial Tenders Board for approval.\n\n\u201cWe sought for the authority for the above approval including the Ministerial approval but none was provided.\n\n\u201d The above unilateral award of contracts without following due process may lead to awarding contracts to unqualified contractors. Recommendation The Registrar/CEO should be sanctioned in line with provisions of Financial Regulation 3117. \u201c\n\nThe NECO\u2019s Registrar, Prof. Godswill Obioma in his response before the Committee on the issue of N461 million said, \u201d these are payments to Data Science Nigeria Limited for the supply of Optical Mark Readers for objectives questions paper for various examinations conducted by the Council.\u201d\n\nProf. Obioma however, failed to justify the payment for the contract before the lawmakers as the Committee sustained the query against the examination body and asked for the refund , though he was the Registrar when act was committed.\n\nThe second query reads,\u201dExamination of contracts awarded for the printing of Security and Non- Security Documents valued at \u20a66,166,405,407.42 revealed that the contracts were awarded without compliance with the provisions of PART VI, Section 24 (I) of the Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2017 as amended, which states that except as provided by this Act, all procurements of goods and works by all procuring entities shall be conducted by open competitive bidding.\n\n\u201cThe following irregularities were also noted, Quotations were not collected from three bidders as required by PPA 2007, Taxes were not deducted from some of the contract payments. iii. There was no Technical and Financial evaluation, Evidence of placement of advertisement was not attached to either payment vouchers or contract files.\n\nThe amount expended was above the threshold of the Council, The contracts were split as some contracts were awarded to same contractor with LPO and work order issued on the same date.\u201d\n\nAlso responding to the N6.1 billion query, the Registrar said, \u201d The contracts for the printing for our questions are awarded through selective tendering. This is the case to avoid leakages of our examinations and award of contract to printers of doubted integrity.\u201d\n\nNot satisfied with Prof. Obioma\u2019s explanations, the Committee Chairman, Senator Mathew Urhoghide sustained the query and insisted that NECO duly provide answers to issues raised by the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation.",

          "text": "Armed bandits Sunday attacked Unguwan Kabulo community in Chikun local government area of Kaduna state and abducted 14 people, Blueprint has gathered.\n\nResidents told our correspondents that 17 people, including women and children, were earlier abducted but three escaped and returned to the community.\n\nA resident of a nearby community who identified himself as Mohammadu said the incident occurred around 1:30 am Sunday when residents woke to the sound of gunshots in the community which he said, was just a kilometre away from Udawa town.\n\n\u201cThey went away with 14 adults, women, and children from the house of a man called Shehu and his neighbour,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammadu however said a security helicopter on surveillance was sighted in the area.\n\nWhen contacted, Public Relations Officer of the state Police command, ASP Mohammed Jalige asked for time to verify the attack but did not at the time of filing this report.\n\nHostages rescued\n\nHowever, the state commissioner of internal security and home affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, later issued a statement of the rescue of kidnapped hostages around Ungwan Najaja, Kerawa, Igabi local government area of the state.\n\nHe said bandits had invaded the village and kidnapped scores of women but security agencies were notified and a fighter jet was swiftly mobilised to the location.\n\nThe commissioner said when the air platforms traced them to the outskirts of the village, the bandits had scampered into the forest and abandoned the women.\n\nThe bandits had earlier injured one Hamza Ibrahim while moving out of the village with the kidnapped women, many of whom were housewives.\n\nSimilarly, bandits have killed the personal driver of the Emir of Birnin Gwari identified as Nasiru Muhammad.\n\nSecurity agencies reported that the armed bandits attacked the Buruku-Birnin Gwari road and Nasiru Muhammad was shot dead around Ungwan Yako forest along the route.\n\nReacting to the incident, Governor Nasir El-Rufai expressed sadness at the killing of the Emir\u2019s driver and sent condolences to the royal father and the family of the deceased, while praying for the repose of his soul.\n\nHe quoted Governor Nasir El-Rufai as commending the fighter jet crew and thanked them for their swift response in rescuing the hostages from the mass kidnap attempt in Igabi local government area.\n\nFCTA\n\nIn a related development, a father and his son were abducted by some yet-to-be identified gunmen who swooped on Kuchiko Relocation Development Area in the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe abduction occurred when the hoodlums subdued the security guards who were armed with knives and related weapons.\n\nThe gunmen, Blueprint gathered, arrived the area in the early hours of Sunday and shot without caution to scare residents, most of whom were woken up by the seemingly endless shooting .\n\nBlueprint further gathered that the timely intervention of soldiers from Defence College Bwari, brought the situation under control after a tough duel between the soldiers and the gunmen.\n\nMonarch urges on insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the Ona of Abaji and Chairman Council of Traditional Rulers in the FCT, HRH Dr. Adamu Baba Yunusa, has called for more coordinated and concerted efforts on the part of security agencies and the various tiers of government to reduce insecurity, especially kidnapping and armed robbery in the territory.\n\nDr. Yunusa stated this Sunday in an interview with Blueprint at his palace, Abaji.\n\nHe observed that residents of Abuja cannot sleep again with two eyes closed due to increasing harassment by armed gangs.\n\nYunusa said the rate of kidnapping and armed robbery had doubled in the rural areas, especially in Abaji, Kwali, Gwagwalada Kuje and Bwari area councils even with the presence of local vigilante not properly equipped to engage the criminals.\n\n\u201cKidnapping has become a very worrisome issue for us now in Abaji and other area councils. The boys will just pick anybody they like and start demanding N5 million or N10million without asking where the relatives of the victims will get that type of money.\n\n\u201cWe want government to do whatever is necessary to solve this problem which has become a national malady. The federal and state government including FCT administrations are trying but we urge them to do more by providing better equipment and training for security personnel.\n\n\u201cWe have vigilante who work with the police but they are not enough. We want more and they do not have the type of equipment to face the criminals. The federal government should allow the vigilante groups to carry the necessary equipment to face the bandits without fearing for their safety, \u201cthe first class monarch said.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to youths and political leaders in the territory to embrace peace and learn to accommodate each other and also engage in useful activities such as farming to ensure gainful employment that will eventually reduce idleness and crime rate in the communities.\n\nSokoto\n\nAlso, some suspected bandits Friday night killed three persons at Garin Zogo village in Sabon Birni local government of Sokoto state.\n\nThey also invaded eight villages in the local government area.\n\nConfirming the development, the councillor representing the areas, Ibrahim Muhammad Saraki, said Garin Zogo was attacked Friday around 10:30pm.\n\n\u201cThey killed three persons and injured one. They also rustled animals, broke into many shops and carted away unascertained number of goods,\u201d the councillor said.\n\nHe said the hoodlums similarly attacked Nasarawa, Gidan Idi and Rambadawa villages Saturday where they injured three person and rustled animals, and further stormed the homes of residents of the area and dispossessed them of their belongings.\n\nThe councillor said: \u201cWe are not living in peace in our communities any longer because the killing is taking place every day. As I am talking to you now our people don\u2019t longer sleep in their homes. They spend their night in Sabon Birni town and return in the morning, including me.\n\n\u201cAnd there are some villages that are completely deserted like Rambadawa, Garin Idi, Tudun Wada, Nasarawa, Tamindawa, Garin Ango, Tsaunar Dogo and Tashalawa.\u201d\n\nThe special adviser to the council chairman on security, Lamiru Umar while corroborating this said, some of their people were currently taking refuge at Tsululu village in Niger Republic.\n\nThe spokesman of the Sokoto Police Command, ASP Sunusi Abubakar could not be reached for comment.\n\nOsun\n\nBut the Osun State Police Command Sunday said it foiled an attempted robbery and kidnapping of motorists along Akure/Ilesa road, Iwarajta by some unknown gunmen.\n\nThis was disclosed Sunday by the command\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Yemisi Opalola in Osogbo.\n\nAccording to Opalola, the suspected gunmen, at about 6 pm Saturday, came out of the bushes along Akure/Ilesha Road, stopping vehicles in an attempt to rob and kidnap their occupants.\n\n\u201cBut the quick intervention of the Police, JTF, and other local security outfits prevented the gunmen from carrying out their nefarious activities,\u201d she said.\n\nCustoms kill 2\n\nIn a related development, two persons, a male and female were feared killed in Eruwa town, Ibarapa East local government area of Oyo state allegedly by men of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS).\n\nThe incident occurred few minutes after the conduct of the state\u2019s local government elections.\n\nIt was learnt that the Customs men were said to be passing through the Eruwa road and met barricade mounted on the road by youth to prevent unusual movement of vehicles during the election at New Eruwa area of the town.\n\nThe barricade, it was gathered, followed tension in the town during the election over an alleged plans by some politicians in the area to perfect rigging in some wards in the town towards the end of the election.\n\nAccording to eye witness account, the youth were bent on searching the Customs vehicle to ascertain allegations that election materials were reportedly smuggled into the said vehicle by some politicians before allowing them passage\n\nOur source stressed that the situation later degenerated into hot argument with youth in the area threatening to attack the Customs men if they want to force their way out of the barricade as some of the Customs men were said to be parking the barricade out of the road.\n\nIt was at this juncture that some of youths resolved into stoning the Customs men with the NCS men on their part shooting into the air to scare the youths and others at the barricade during which the stray bullets from the sporadic shootings reportedly hit and killed two of the youths.\n\n\u201cIt later turned to a heated argument and all I could remember were gunshots in the air. Suddenly, two persons were down \u2013 a guy and a lady,\u201d the source said.\n\nAs at the time of sending this report, the Oyo/Osun NCS Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr Kayode Wey was yet to respond to our call for his reaction on the incident.\n\n\u201d Please sir. Let me confirm. I have not been briefed of any matter like that sir. Please sir, I would get back to you as soon as i have any information.\u201d\n\nCleric warns\n\nMeanwhile, leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has warned that the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) will be deadlier than Boko Haram, adding that another group will come up after the latter.\n\nHe issued the prophecies while addressing members of his congregation, confirming that Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau is dead.\n\nIn a statement, a copy of which Blueprint got in Abuja said: \u201cAbubakar Shekau is dead and buried, anyone that claims to be Shekau is just a joker but ISWAP will become deadlier as they want to shoot down planes, another terrorist group will rise up through Boko Haram but will fade out soon.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also mentioned some states that should be on alert against deadly attacks and killings.\n\nThe cleric further said: \u201cThe following states must be very watchful of major attacks that will happen; Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna, Yobe, Bauchi, Plateau, Benue, Adamawa, Ekiti, Ondo, Oyo, Imo, Anambra, Ebonyi, Cross River. They must not joke with this message.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

These are the proper and legal fora for national debate, not some lopsided, undemocratic body with a pre-determined set of objectives\u201d.\n\nBMO said the public hearing for amendment of constitution as facilitated by National Assembly committee on Constitution review is the only acknowledged constitutional platform recognized by law, as part of the process of amending the Constitution and should be acknowledged by everybody.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has been very much up to speed on national opinions around the amendment and updating of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe much-awaited zonal public hearings on the review of the 1999 Constitution would hold from May 26 to 27 and the event would hold simultaneously across 12 state capitals in Nigeria. It would witness two public hearings per geopolitical zone and a national public hearing is expected to hold in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cWhile Jos and Minna would host the public hearings in the North Central geopolitical zone, North East and North West would hold in Bauchi and Gombe, as well as Kaduna and Sokoto respectively. Similarly, South-East would hold in Owerri and Enugu, South-South and South-West would be hosted in Port Harcourt and Asaba, as well as Akure and Lagos respectively.\n\n\u201cChairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege called on those who have already submitted memoranda to speak to the documents at the events\u201d.\n\nAccording to the group, this is a huge opportunity for all \u2018marginalised\u2019 groups, canvassers of a new Constitution, canvassers of new input into the Constitution and champions of redemption of errors in the Constitution to present their arguments for amendment of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cEthic irredentists that have made restructuring a symposium should also exploit this opportunity. This is the right and true process to amend the Nigerian Constitution with intent at restructuring as highlighted by the committee and anyone who has an interest in any aspect of the Constitution that needs to be amended can forward to the Constitution review committee,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "A Brazil based drug kingpin has been nabbed with 36 blocks of cocaine, weighing about 30 kilogrammes with a street value of over N8 billion (about $20m) at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, MMIA, Lagos by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nA statement on Sunday by NDLEA\u2019s spokesman, Femi Babafemi said the drug lord, Ejiofor Enwereaku, who leads a syndicate was arrested at the airport on Friday May 14, 2021 for importing 27.95 kilogrammes of cocaine using their organised criminal gang, which specialises in tagging/planting drugs in innocent travellers\u2019 luggage.\n\nBabafemi said based on intelligence, narcotic agents at the MMIA had on Saturday 8th May, 2021 intercepted a bag that arrived the Lagos airport from GRU, Brazil via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on the Ethiopian airline with baggage tag No- ET331199 but was disclaimed by an arriving passenger on the flight.\n\nHe said that the disclaimed bag was promptly secured by NDLEA operatives for investigation, adding that on Sunday, 9th May, 2021, a man came to the airport to make inquiry on how to get the disclaimed bag released, which prompted his immediate arrest and investigation.\n\nBabafemi disclosed that the disclaimed bag was opened in the presence of the arriving passenger and the man who had come to negotiate it\u2019s release.\n\nHe said when it was opened, the bag was found to contain 36 blocks of cocaine, weighing 27.95 kilogrammes.\n\nHe said a follow up sting operation was initiated, which led to the arrest on Friday 14th May of Ejiofor Enwereaku, the prime suspect, upon his arrival from Addis Ababa onboard Ethiopian airline.\n\nThe spokesman said during preliminary interrogation after his arrest, Enwereaku\n\nconfessed to have been contracted by his Ethiopian associate who is a notorious drug baron to claim and push out the consignment in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nBabafemi said the suspect also admitted to have paid the $24,500 bribe in three tranches to compromise NDLEA officers. The first was $10,000 delivered through his representative in Lagos and another $10, 000 via his First Bank account while the third tranche of $4,500 was paid at the point of his arrest.\n\nHe said Enwereaku\u2019s group is suspected to be responsible for recruiting traffickers to move illicit drugs to various destinations using Nigeria as their transit location and also planting drugs in the luggage of innocent travellers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd) apparently impressed by the outcome of the intelligence-led operational strategies that took weeks of painstaking efforts and closely monitored by him, commended the Commander, MMIA Command of the agency, Ahmadu Garba, his officers and men for their diligence and resilience in following up every lead in the case until the kingpin was successfully entrapped and arrested.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have warned that we\u2019ll henceforth not only go after the traffickers but with the same vigour target the cartels and the kingpins that operate them; the latest arrest is a clear confirmation that we\u2019ll match our words with action and that we\u2019ll come for those who will not back out of the criminal trade, wherever they are hiding pushing instruments of death through our borders to destroy the lives of our youths.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode",

          "text": "Hundreds of masked Hamas fighters brandishing assault rifles paraded in Gaza City and the group\u2019s top leader made his first public appearance on Saturday, in a defiant show of strength after the militants\u2019 11-day war with Israel.\n\nSaturday marked the first full day of a cease-fire, and Egyptian mediators held talks to firm up the truce which ended the fourth Israel-Hamas war in just over a decade.\n\nIn the fighting, Israel unleashed hundreds of airstrikes against militant targets in Gaza, while Hamas and other militants fired more than 4,000 rockets toward Israel. More than 250 people were killed, the vast majority of them Palestinians.\n\nIn Gaza City, residents began assessing damage.\n\nOne of Gaza City\u2019s busiest commercial areas, Omar al-Mukhtar Street, was covered in debris, smashed cars and twisted metal after a 13-floor building in its centre was flattened in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nMerchandise was covered in soot and strewn inside smashed stores and on the pavement. Municipal workers swept broken glass and twisted metal from streets and sidewalks.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t expect this amount of damage,\u201d said Ashour Subeih, who sells baby clothes. \u201cWe thought the strike was a bit further from us. But as you can see not an area of the shop is intact.\u201d\n\nHaving been in business for one year, Subeih estimated his losses were double what he has made so far.\n\nDrone video and photos showed some city blocks reduced to rubble, in between homes and businesses left standing.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have claimed victory.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds of Hamas fighters wearing military camouflage paraded past the mourning tent for Bassem Issa, a senior commander killed in the fighting. The top Hamas leader in Gaza, Yehiyeh Sinwar, paid his respects in his first public appearance since the war began.\n\nIsrael bombed the house of Sinwar, along with that of other senior Hamas figures, as part of its attack on what it said was the group\u2019s military infrastructure. Israel\u2019s defense minister, Benny Gantz, has said Israel delivered a punishing blow to Hamas, and that top Hamas figures remained targets.\n\nStill, there was a widespread expectation that the cease-fire would stick for now, even if another round of fighting at some point seems inevitable.\n\nUnderlying issues remain unresolved, including an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade, now in its 14th year, that is choking Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million residents and a refusal by the Islamic militant Hamas to disarm.\n\nThe UN Security Council released a statement Saturday, welcoming the cease-fire and stressing \u201cthe immediate need for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population, particularly in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThousands rallied in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, calling for coexistence between Jews and Arabs.\n\nThe fighting began on May 10, when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem. The barrage came after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\n\nHeavy-handed police tactics at the compound and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.\n\nThe war has further sidelined Hamas\u2019 main political rival, the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, which oversees autonomous enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West\n\nBank. Hamas\u2019 popularity seemed to be growing as it positioned itself as a defender of Palestinian claims to Jerusalem.\n\nOn Friday, hours after the cease-fire took effect, thousands of Palestinians in the Al-Aqsa compound chanted against Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his self-rule government. \u201cDogs of the Palestinian Authority, out, out,\u201d they shouted, and \u201cThe people want the president to leave.\u201d\n\nIt was an unprecedented display of anger against Abbas. The conflict also brought to the surface deep frustration among Palestinians, whether in the occupied West Bank, Gaza or within Israel, over the status quo, with the Israeli-Palestinian peace process all but abandoned for years.\n\nDespite his weakened status, Abbas will be the point of contact for any renewed U.S. diplomacy, since Israel and the West, including the United States, consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken is to meet with Abbas and Israeli leaders when he visits in the coming week. Abbas is expected to raise demands that any Gaza reconstruction plans go through the Palestinian Authority to avoid strengthening Hamas.\n\nAbbas met Saturday with Egyptian mediators, discussing the rebuilding of Gaza and internal Palestinian relations, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.\n\nAn Egyptian diplomat said that two teams of mediators were in Israel and the Palestinian territories to continue talks on firming up a cease-fire deal and securing long-term calm.\n\nThe diplomat said discussions include implementing agreed-on measures in Gaza and Jerusalem, including ways to prevent practices that led to the latest fighting. He did not elaborate. He was apparently referring to violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the planned eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in east Jerusalem.\n\nThe diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes deliberations.\n\nSeparately, a 130-truck convoy with humanitarian aid and medical supplies reached the Gaza border from Egypt on Saturday, according to a senior Egyptian official at the border crossing. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nAcross Gaza, an assessment of the damage to the territory\u2019s already decrepit infrastructure began.\n\nThe ministry of public works and housing said that 769 housing and commercial units were rendered uninhabitable, at least 1,042 units in 258 buildings were destroyed and just over 14,500 units suffered minor damage.\n\nThe United Nations said about 800,000 people in Gaza do not have regular access to clean piped water, as nearly 50% of the water network was damaged in the fighting.\n\nIsrael has said it was targeting Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including a vast tunnel system running under roads and homes, as well as command centers, rocket launchers and the homes of commanders. The Israeli military has said it was trying to minimize harm to civilians and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry says at least 248 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children and 39 women, with 1,910 people wounded. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Twelve people were killed in Israel, all but one of them civilians, including a 5-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl.\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas and the smaller militant group of Islamic Jihad of hiding the actual number of fighters killed in the war. Prime Minister Netanyahu said Friday that more than 200 militants were killed, including 25 senior commanders.\n\nIslamic Jihad on Saturday gave a first account of deaths within its ranks, saying that 19 of its commanders and fighters were killed, including the head of the rocket unit in northern Gaza.",
