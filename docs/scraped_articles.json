          "text": "By Egufe Yafugborhi\n\nSENATOR Magnus Abe, still consulting towards contesting 2023 Rivers state governorship, has said it would be sheer pretense for him or anyone else aspiring to say he has all the answers to all challenges facing the state.\n\nAt the interactive session with Rivers youths and young entrepreneurs in Port Harcourt yesterday, the former Senator representing Rivers South East Senatorial District further asserted that he would also be pretending to say hasn\u2019t been part of the issues or mistakes that may have set back the state in the past.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretense to say I have all the answers to whatever challenges our state is facing. Or to pretend that somehow I am not part of whatever may have been the mistakes or issues of our states in the past.\n\n\u201cI am part of whatever success we have had in Rivers state because I have been in Rivers politics at least from 1998 or so. I am also part of whatever failures we may have had.\n\n\u201cBut in course of whatever success or failure we have put together, we have also acquired experience. We have better ideas. We know the things that will not work and can\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cWe know the thing that would work and can be made better. So the temptation to throw away every old politician and want to start afresh is not the way to go. Somebody starting afresh would have to know what people already knows should not be known.\n\n\u201cSo, going forward, we must do things differently from the way we have done them before. If we continue to do things the way we have always done them, don\u2019t be surprise that we will get exact same results that our actions have always produced.\u201d\n\nAmong other cautions, Abe admonished Rivers youths to stop relying on the godfather syndrome which he noted has not brought about the society of \u201cour dreams\u201d.\n\nThe youths, he urged, should rather believe in themselves and support merit and competence in enthronement of an enduring leadership which would be commitment to building a society that gives the rich and poor equal opportunities.",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has reacted to the spate of killings, kidnapping and other issues of insecurity facing the people of Ogun State, accusing Governor Dapo Abiodun of not doing enough.\n\nThe Ogun PDP Publicity Secretary, Akinloye Bankole, in an interview with DAILY POST, condemned the level of insecurity in the state, advising the governor to engage locals in the security arrangements of the state.\n\nHe said the body language of Abiodun and his alleged lack of focus was also fuelling the tendency for general insecurity in Ogun.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the spate of killings, kidnapping and other cases of insecurity in Ogun State. What we have in Ogun State today by perpetrators of evil is roundly condemned by the PDP. Having said that, we must also say that the governor\u2019s body language, the penchant for maladministration and lack of focus by the ruling APC government under the watch of Gov Dapo Abiodun also fuels the tendency for general insecurity in Ogun State.\n\n\u201cThe government is clearly not doing enough as regards security of lives and properties in Ogun State. And that is why we have always insisted that the fundamental role of a government is protection of lives and properties. Ever since this government came on board, it had never pretended to be capable of solving these problems. That is why we say this government has not only failed, it has failed groundly in its core responsibilities; and it is very sad that despite the amount of financial resources that have been committed issues of insecurity in Ogun, we are still at this stage where people cannot sleep with their two eyes closed,\u201d Bankole stated.\n\nHe expressed worries that nowhere in Ogun is safe, adding that Abiodun\u2019s engagements with security agents are not yielding any result.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it, anywhere you go in Ogun State, there is an issue of kidnapping. It happens almost on daily basis here in Ogun. It has unfortunately become a norm. If you are driving from Lafenwa to Sango, you\u2019re not secure; on Lagos-Ibadan express road, nobody is secure; even from Odeda to Ibadan, you are not safe. The worst of them all is Rounder-Ayetoro road in Yewa. Government will tell you it is buying patrol vehicles, engaging security agencies, but these are not yielding any positive result,\u201d he said.\n\nIn its advice, the PDP told Abiodun to engage the Community Development Associations (CDAs), saying: \u201cSecurity is community-based. And that is why we have recommended to the government that it must engage members of the CDA more. Make use of your councillors, the traditional rulers because they are the ones domiciled in the grassroots. They know every corner around their neighbourhood. They know who is coming in or going out.\u201d\n\nWhile charging Ogun residents to get set for the 2023 election, Bankole posited that: \u201cUnfortunately, life in Ogun State under Dapo Abiodun has become so short, nasty and brutish, just like in the old Hobbesian state of the nation. Nobody is secure and it has become so worrisome. That is why we urge people to end this maladministration, this agony that Dapo Abiodun clearly represents.\n\n\u201cDapo Abiodun has manifestedly failed to secure Ogun State.\u201d\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of Gov Abiodun and his government proved abortive as of Monday morning.\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Waheed Odusile; Gov Abiodun\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin; and a Special Adviser on Communication, Remmy Hazzan, did not answer calls to their phones.\n\nAlso, a text message sent to them was not replied to hours before filing this report.",

          "text": "\n\n*John Akpanudoedehe\u2019s fate uncertain\n\n*Group alleges fresh plot to sack Yobe gov through court injunction\n\n*Party moves to have court injunction stopping convention vacated\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may have agreed to keep Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as Interim Chairman of the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), while Niger State Governor Sani Bello functions as de facto chairman, though in acting capacity while Buni remains away.\n\n\n\nBuni had travelled for medical reasons and transmitted power to Bello in writing to act as the CECPC chairman. It was gathered yesterday that the party is maintaining the letter of transition remains in force even as Buni remains interim caretaker chairman. .\n\n\n\nHowever, it is not clear what they would ultimately do with Buni, as there is a move by some party stakeholders to have him impeached. Also, the fate of the CECPC Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe remains uncertain in all the permutations and intrigues playing out.\n\n\n\nJust last weekend, as part of intense lobby going on in the ruling party, former leaders of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) stormed London, where President Muhammadu Buhari is currently undergoing routine medical check-up, to persuade him to give more room to members of CPC,, one of the legacy parties that merged to form the APC before the 2015 general election, claiming they have been thoroughly marginalised in the scheme of things.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, according to observers \u201ccentral London Mosque, was overtaken by Nigerians, including ministers, governors, and many high net worth people, during Friday jumat prayers. As politicians have flown to London to lobby the President ahead of 2023 elections..\u201d\n\n\n\nUnder the new arrangement, Buni officially remains the interim CECPC chair as he was never legally removed in the first place, and since he transmitted a letter to Bello to act in his absence, that automatically confers his powers on Bello. And Bello would continue in his acting role which by implication means he would be carrying out the day to day running of the party. Meanwhile some of Buni\u2019s supporters believe he may return to the country this week while others want him to remain abroad until after the convention.\n\n\n\nThe Party\u2019s National Convention slated for March 26, THISDAY learnt will hold as planned.\n\nReliable sources in the presidency disclosed these yesterday, stressing that only a properly constituted National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party can remove the Buni-led CECPC.\n\n\n\nBello had announced a few days ago that he had taken over affairs at the APC national headquarters, disclosing that he was acting as Chairman in the absence of Buni.\n\n\n\nHe has called a NEC a meeting which INEC said was out of order because the letter was not signed by Chairman Buni and the Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn the turn of event the President\u2019s Legal Adviser may have appealed to him to allow Buni remain as interim chair while Bello continues as acting chairman.\n\n\n\nAccording to one of the sources, some of the president\u2019s associates noted that by the framework of the Party\u2019s NEC, Buni was never removed as CECPC chairman. \u201cYou cannot even be talking of return, when he was never removed, in the first place,\u201d a presidency source said.\n\n\n\nThe alleged removal of Buni had unsettled the party, causing division among APC governors and top stakeholders, with some alleging that the Yobe State governor was plotting to scuttle the party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\n\nWhile some expressed satisfaction with the development, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejected a letter inviting it to an emergency meeting of the party\u2019s NEC, where Bello\u2019s chairmanship was to be ratified.\n\n\n\nWhat has become apparent is that majority of the governors, in their bid to oust Buni by all means, failed to reckon with INEC. They thought they had succeeded, well, almost, and they had started to celebrate victory, until INEC threw a spanner in the works.\n\nThe commission\u2019s position, among other issues, led some from Buhari\u2019s inner circle of advisers to meet with him at the weekend.\n\n\n\nShedding light on the outcome of the meeting with the president, a source pointed out that Buhari informed those in attendance that his desire was to see that the convention was held as planned. Buhari also wanted to see a smooth, democratic and popular contest that would lead to the birth of a brand new National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, the source said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe president was persuaded that there was a process that needed to be followed to remove the Buni-led CECPC. The NEC of the party is the highest administrative organ of the party, which takes very important decisions in terms of removal and appointment of the party leadership. Buni was not appointed by an imperial authority with the power remove him.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince the decision to appoint him was taken by NEC, it is only NEC that can remove him. So, Buni was never removed, in the first place. Certainly, if he personally withdraws, resigns or a NEC meeting takes place to remove him, then we can be talking about having a new CECPC chairman.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of that has taken place; so the idea of removal does not arise. However, the party may come up with an arrangement to allow for certain processes to take place, particularly relating to conventions.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut Buni may decide to take the back seat to allow the convention process to take place, if he does that, then fine. However, the idea of concluding that he has been removed does not arise.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuni was blamed for withholding information from Party leaders about a court injunction stopping the party from going ahead with the convention. The Party has since set machinery in motion to have the injunction vacated this week to enable the convention hold.\n\n\n\nA faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate so. Apparently miffed by the what he was told, the president was said to have immediately directed that Buni be removed and replaced. Buni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself.\n\n\n\nAnother source at the meeting explained that Buhari was convinced of the need to allow Buni to to continue as interim chairman which the president was said to have accepted to save the party from danger.\n\n\n\nThe source also revealed that another contentious issue that was discussed was the president\u2019s purported endorsement of former Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Adamu, for the position of APC National Chairman. There have been intense lobby for the President to drop Adamu and allow for a contested convention. Most of the other aspirants have kicked against the President\u2019s purported endorsement of Abdulahi Adamu. The lobby to drop Adamu was said to have intensified at the weekend as some governors are preparing to jet to London to mount pressure on Buhari to change his mind on Adamu.\n\n\n\nBuhari had assured party members before departing the country for his medical trip, that he would do everything to ensure the convention holds as scheduled on March 26.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress Youth Development and Solidarity Network (APC-YDSN) has alleged fresh plot by some APC Governors to get a court injunction to effectively sack Buni as CECPC Chairman.\n\nThe Secretary General, Mr. Tobias Ogbeh, made this allegation while addressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe group said after the failed leadership change in the party, there had been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\n\nThe group stated: \u201cAs we may be aware, some governors within the party have attempted to change the leadership of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs despicable as this might sound, there has been an attempt at effecting a change in the leadership of the party, not on the strength of the interest of the party, but in furtherance of a blind ambition towards taking over the party structure through the back door in the buildup to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that we have it on good authority that since the humiliation suffered by the sponsors of the failed leadership change in the party, there have been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe group warned judges and other officers in the legal profession to refuse to be used as pawns to truncate the democratic processes in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThe group informed all APC stakeholders and members of the general public that part of the new plot was to secure a court judgement through the back door that would sack the party\u2019s leadership from office.\n\n\n\nThe scheme, the group alleged, was heavily funded by a serving minister and presidential aspirant from the south.\n\nThe group, therefore, called on the general public to be on the watch as the manifestation of this plot would gather steam soonest.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*NBET disputes power generators\u2019 debt claim\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nPower Generation Companies (Gencos) under the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC) yesterday stated that the power supply situation in the country was worsening because they were owed over N1.6 trillion since 2013.\n\n\n\nAPGC\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr. Joy Ogaji, in a briefing in Abuja, argued that a situation where the energy dispatched by the power generators was used as an index for power generation capacity was detrimental to their survival.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, the already bad power supply situation in the country had worsened as players in the sector continued to trade blames as to whose table the buck stops.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are currently owed N1.644 trillion. One of the reasons that the power plants are down is due to inefficient management of the grid,\u201d Ogaji said.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, the Gencos have exhausted all their borrowing sources, as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had reportedly warned the banks to desist from lending money to them.\n\nShe stated, \u201cIf you give us gas, provide forex to carry out maintenance. I have told you most of the units are down and they need money to fix them.\n\n\n\n\u201cGive us enough money to pay our gas suppliers because it is pre-payment. But for power, it is take and pay later. There is no way that this misalignment will help us.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Ogaji stated admitted that at the moment, the Gencos were generating an average of 4,000MW.\n\nHowever, the debt claim by the Gencos was immediately refuted by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET). NBET disputed the figures quoted by the power generators, saying only companies with active gas supply and transportation contracts are paid for unutilised capacity.\n\n\n\nThe Head, Corporate Communication, NBET, Henrietta Ighomrore, explained that in the country, only five power generation companies with active Gas Purchase Agreement (GPA) were entitled to be paid for unused capacity.\n\nAccording to her, claims that the Gencos have the capacity to generate 9,000MW are not accurate, as inspections by NBET had shown that the so-called capacity does not exist.\n\n\n\nEarlier, Ighomrore argued that the Gencos had always been paid as and when due, explaining that in the last payment cycle alone, the Gencos were paid N38 billion for electricity distributed on the grid.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, NBET has paid the Gencos over 90 per cent of their invoices. She noted that the company paid the generators almost immediately remittances from the Discos were received.\n\nHowever, Ogaji noted that the illiquidity caused by the huge sums owed the Gencos by NBET had continued to frustrate them and render them incapable of meeting their obligations.\n\n\n\nSuch obligations, she said, included Operations and Maintenance (O&M) as and when due, procurement of critical capital, spare parts and accessories, payment, and servicing of existing loans from lenders and financiers and employee- obligations.\n\n\n\nOgaji listed foreign exchange as another challenge faced by the hydroelectric power plants, whose concession fees, she maintained were \u201cdollarised.\u201d\n\nShe said most of the electricity generated in Nigeria came from gas-fired turbines, explaining that Gencos have consistently been dealing with unending gas-related challenges, which inhibit optimal generation.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, issues of gas volume, gas quality, gas pressure and gas transportation have consistently curtailed capacity utilisation by Gencos thereby affecting generation.\n\nOgaji stated, \u201cUnfortunately, the unenforceable state of the contracts in the NESI and the broken cycle of payment assurance has made the enforcement of what would ordinarily be basic obligations of parties to the industry agreements, impossible.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince 2013 when the power sector was partially privatised till date, weak and inadequate infrastructure (transmission and distribution) have continued to render inconsequential, a significant portion of the generation capacities recovered or added by Gencos through huge investments done by them to increase their respective generation capacities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to her, while the owners of the Gencos invested and increased generation capacity up to 13,000MW across the country, no corresponding investment and improvement was made at the transmission and distribution ends. The result, she said, was the significant stranded capacity of Gencos.\n\n\n\nOgaji added, \u201cThe persistence of this anomaly over these years, compelled Gencos to begin to question the commercial reasonability of continued investment in recovery or expansion of generation capacity that would end up being stranded and not utilised to transmit and distribute electricity to end users who are yearning for same.\u201d\n\nShe said the foundational agreements, which Gencos were told existed before, no longer exists, after they had commenced performance, with dire implication for power generators.\n\n\n\nOgaji stated, \u201cWe should address the root cause and not the symptoms, for sustainability of the NESI and the power sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current state of the national grid must be addressed, otherwise we will continue to always deny Nigerians their legitimate expectation of unhindered rights to reliable supply of electricity.\u201d\n\n\n\nChecks by THISDAY revealed that all the parties\u2019 positions were not entirely accurate. Firstly, it is wrong to claim that only five generation companies have gas supply agreement, meaning that there is no level playing field. Further checks revealed that the Gencos were being owed not only capacity charges but also for interest and energy charges as well \u2013 value which is yet to be determined. And also the forex issue is not restricted to hydros alone, but it affects gas fire and thermal plants as well.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is equally carrying out maintenance work on their lines. Furthermore, a lot of the gas companies were also doing maintenance work on their infrastructure, limiting supply of gas to generation companies. All these put together made power supply epileptic in the country\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We need to work together to ensure that our people benefit from religion.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe tend to underestimate the importance of religion, despite the fact that it plays a key role in the development of the society, not just in the spiritual aspect, but also physical.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many nations of the world that have benefitted from the impact of religion, both spiritually and physically. So, we must use religion in our countries (in Africa) to help our people to live better lives because in other parts of the world, leaders of faith have used religion to better the lives of the people.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking further on the need for leaders of faith to close ranks for the purpose of using religion to address emerging challenges in the society, the vice president noted, \u201cNo matter what the situation may be, we in Africa must be able to sit together and talk. We must never allow situations where we cannot sit together.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith what is going on across the world, people of faith must continue to emphasise that both major religions (Islam and Christianity) promote peace and we must allow our people to practise whatever religion they want to practise.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo praised the leader of the group, while commending the Tijjaniya Movement for its progressive ideals and compassion for the needs of the people.\n\n\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Sheikh Niass, who spoke in French with interpretation by a spokesman, thanked the vice president for the opportunity to meet with him. He described the vice president as a great personality, the type needed both in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n\n\nSheikh Niass stated, \u201cThe vice president is a great personality with an exceptional character, standing on two feet: one as a political leader concerned about the progress of his people and the second, as a man of God.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrica needs a person of your nature with very strong background in religion and politics. I pray that the Almighty Allah will upgrade you and enable you achieve your desires and aspirations because, like I said, not only Nigeria but Africa will benefit from your leadership qualities.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that Nigeria \u201cis the heart of Africa and whatever Nigeria becomes, Africa becomes.\u201d\n\nThe Tijjaniya leader also expressed the group\u2019s gratitude to Buhari for his support, while praying for his safety and that Nigeria would overcome all its challenges.\n\nOsinbajo promised to convey the Sheik\u2019s warm greetings and appreciations to the president. He also prayed for peace in Nigeria, Africa, and the world.\n\n\n\nThe Grand Khalifa of Tijjaniya worldwide and other members of the movement from across Africa had converged on Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, to celebrate the 36th International Maulid Anniversary in honour of the movement\u2019s late leader, Sheikh Ibrahim Niass.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Says national convention still holds March 26\n\n*Bello, el-Rufai, Fayemi meet president in London\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appraised recent developments in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and warned the leaders and members of the party to desist forthwith from name-calling and backstabbing.\n\nRather, he said, the party must be ready to put its house in order ahead of the planned national convention of the party holding in Abuja on March 26, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe embattled Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\n\n\nAs Buni is being expected back to take over, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State governor, Mr. Abubakar Sani Bello; Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nThis is as the ruling party has clarified that the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nAs the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party await the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders of the party, they have also mounted pressure on Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the scheduled meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, tasked the leaders and membership of the APC to stop mudslinging ahead of the forthcoming national convention that will lead to the election of new national leaders to run the party for the next four years.\n\nHe also urged them to remain steadfast and maintain their unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.\n\n\n\nThe president asked the APC members to look at the once-powerful, \u201cmain opposition\u201d Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption.\n\nHe warned that \u201dthey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari recalled that the APC started with a confidence of victory, adding that the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\n\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\n\nThis alone, in addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party, the president further noted, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari also stressed that for more than a week, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinise their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They incline only for things that matter.\u201d\n\nBello, el-Rufai, Fayemi Meet Buhari in London\n\nMeanwhile, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State Governor, Bello; Kaduna State Governor, el-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nA source in the ruling party said the visit was informed by \u201cthe urgent need to brief the president on events since the new Acting Chairman took over as well as bring him up to speed with the preparations for the March 17 NEC meeting and the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe team is also in London to check up on the President as he takes his deserved rest,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe source added that the governors\u2019 visit will put a final seal on all of APC\u2019s plans for the National Convention, especially its NEC meeting believed to be a major determinant of what would happen at the March 26 convention.\n\nBuni to Return This Week as Party Denies Sacking Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn a related development, Buni is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\nOne of Buni\u2019s aides informed THISDAY yesterday that as soon as the Yobe State governor returns to the country, he would take charge of the affairs of the party.\n\n\n\nThe aide, who pleaded anonymity, also stated that the acting Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Niger State, Bello is expected to vacate the seat for Buni to avoid dragging the party into any illegality.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe (Buni) is expected back on Monday and of course, with the position of INEC which made his position very clear and if you have read the dailies today, even the secretariat has backtracked and confirmed that he\u2019s still in charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs soon as he\u2019s back, obviously, the next thing is to take charge. I am sure the party or the acting chairman now will not want to drag the party into any unconstitutionality or any illegality.\u201d\n\nAlso, Buni\u2019s Director-General for Media and Publicity, Mr Mamman Mohmamed said the acting chairman had stated in unambiguous terms that he was in an acting capacity.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that whenever the substantive chairman comes back, the acting chairman would have to give way.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis is what we expect and this position is very clear by the regulatory body of political parties, which is the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC as an institution has said that as far as it is concerned, Governor Buni remains the chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure nobody will want to act in another illegality. So, he is coming back and I am sure the acting chairman will vacate his seat for the substantive chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if Buni will go ahead with the NEC meeting slated for Thursday, Mohammed said it would be part of the issues that would be considered when Buni is back.\n\nThe ruling party has also clarified that Akpanudoedehe did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nThere was confusion at the national secretariat of the party last Tuesday over the fate of Akpanudoedehe.\n\nWhile there were reports that Akpanudoedehe had tendered his resignation having read the handwriting from the new leadership, he had insisted that he was still the secretary except the President said otherwise.\n\nHowever, the APC Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu Dambatta in a statement issued yesterday said the National Secretary never sent any resignation letter.\n\n\n\nDambatta stated: \u201cFurther to the media conference earlier held by the Spokesman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mr. Ismaeel Ahmed, the party wishes to note that the Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, never sent a resignation letter to the party to the best of its knowledge and neither was he sacked as some social media blogs speculated. All those are utterly false.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe APC is one family, the Caretaker is one unit. We have an Acting Chairman who is racing against time to deliver a convention and committee members that are united in supporting him in carrying out that onerous mandate,\u201d Dambatta explained.\n\n\n\nHe called on the public to disregard social media stories that are not rooted in fact or even sound reasoning.\n\nTHISDAY checks however revealed that the twist in APC\u2019s narration may not be unconnected with the firm stand of the INEC not to recognise the Niger State Governor, Bello as the acting Caretaker Chairman.\n\n\n\nBello, who assumed the leadership of the party last Monday had written the electoral body notifying the commission of the party\u2019s decision to convene for an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.\n\nThe ruling party had scheduled its NEC meeting for Thursday, March 17, 2022, where it is believed that the leadership quagmire would be resolved.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that Bello, upon resumption as acting Caretaker Chairman transmitted a letter dated March 8, 2022, informing INEC of the change of guard at the party\u2019s national secretariat.\n\n\n\nHowever, INEC in a letter signed by the Secretary to the commission, Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony and dated March 9, 2022, said the party must give it 21 days\u2019 notice and that the letter was not signed by the party\u2019s Chairman and Secretary.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that INEC\u2019s response forced the party\u2019s stakeholders to bring Buni back to ensure that the emergency NEC meeting and the national convention of the party are held as scheduled.\n\nIn a related development, the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party are said to be waiting for the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders as part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the leadership crisis in the party.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that the Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami was in London, while Buni also flew to London from Dubai to be part of the meeting.\n\n\n\nA source, who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cMalami is in London. His mission is two-fold: one, to let Buhari know of the outcome of the Senate rejection of the amendment of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act; two, to report on issues going on in the party. Buni was also in London but is expected back today or tomorrow\u201d\n\nInvestigations showed that the NEC meeting of APC will go on as INEC has no power over the internal control of the parties.\n\n\n\nAnother party source told THISDAY that the Secretary, Senator Akpanudoedehe and the acting Caretaker Chairman and the Governor of Niger State, Bello met with one of the founding fathers of the party on Friday in Abuja.\n\nAt the meeting, it was gathered that the party chieftain urged Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the NEC meeting.\n\n\n\nThe source said some APC governors are also talking to the secretary to see the need to sign the notice and save the party from destruction.\n\nThe source noted that all efforts are to ensure that the convention date of the party is not postponed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is anxiety among members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the national caucus of the main opposition party and the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meet on Monday (tomorrow) and Tuesday to take a decision on the presidential ticket of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\n\n\nIn a memo to its national caucus, the main opposition party has directed members of the caucus to consider whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe party also urged its national caucus to determine the implications of throwing the presidential ticket open.\n\nWith the election of its National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu from the North, it was expected that the party\u2019s presidential candidate would emerge from the South.\n\n\n\nBut the main opposition party has been playing hide-and-seek games with the issue of where its presidential candidate would come from, raising concerns that it might throw the ticket open, against the popular agitation for power to shift to the South.\n\n\n\nUnlike the PDP, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has set the necessary machinery in motion to choose its presidential candidate from the South.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the two organs of the PDP will decide whether to zone or throw open the presidential ticket of the party for the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nPDP NEC will also decide on the recommendation of the 2019 Elections Review Committee set up by the party to assess its performance in the last general election.\n\n\n\nThe committee headed by the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed had in its recommendation submitted to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party on May 21, 2021, urged the party to allow interested party members to vie for the 2023 presidency, irrespective of their geopolitical zones.\n\n\n\nThe committee had anchored its position on the fact that across the land, Nigeria boasts of good hands capable of bailing the country \u201cout of her current quagmire.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report of the committee had stated that: \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that, for fairness and equity, the North-east and South-east geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency, should be given special consideration, in choosing the presidential flagbearer of the party, for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. Moreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader, with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian, from every part of the country, should be allowed to choose the best candidate, through a credible primary election; as a way of institutionalising a merit-based leadership recruitment process, for the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nReceiving the report, the former leader of the party under Prince Uche Secondus had pledged that the NEC would set up a technical committee to review the report, but it never did.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the report of the Bauchi State governor\u2019s committee would form the main agenda of the national caucus meeting and NEC meetings of the PDP.\n\n\n\nA source within the party\u2019s NWC told THISDAY at the weekend that: \u201cThese two organs of the party will look at the report of Governor Bala Mohammed\u2019s committee and in their wisdom decide to either throw the presidential ticket open or zone it to one of the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the memo to the national caucus, there are variables we want them to consider. One is whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election come 2023 and two, what will it cost the PDP if it throws the presidential ticket open.\n\n\n\n\u201cThree, as a party in opposition whether zoning in the PDP is in the overall interest of the party,\u201d the source explained.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that after the National Caucus and NEC meetings, the party\u2019s NWC will still take the issue to the Board of Trustees (BoT) and the PDP governors as well as the National Assembly caucus before a final decision would be reached.\n\nAppointment of Mobilisation Director Divides PDP Govs\n\nMeanwhile, the governors of the PDP are already divided over the appointment of a substantive director of mobilisation and organisation for the party.\n\nThe Department of Mobilisation and Organisation of the party is the engine room of the PDP in terms of the election of all delegates, both ad-hoc and statutory delegates, as well as election management.\n\n\n\nThe department is under the control and supervision of the National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature, who is a nominee of the Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, who is a presidential aspirant.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a governor from one of the South-south states is the arrowhead of those who want the substantive director replaced with a new director from either Delta State or Imo or Kogi State, so as not to give any presidential aspirant undue advantage.\n\n\n\nHowever, it was learnt that some other governors of the party and the incumbent National Organising Secretary, Umar have rejected the names of those recommended for appointment for the position of new Director of Mobilisation and Organisation.\n\n\n\nThe National Organising Secretary who is a member of the National Working Committee has argued that he was not aware of the said appointment until the nominees were invited for interview.\n\n\n\nAn internal memo sighted by THISDAY, which was signed by the National Secretary of the PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, listed those invited for the interview to include: Stephen Onuh from Kogi State; Dr Okey Mbionwu from Imo State and Mr Chukwuma Chinoye from Delta State.\n\n\n\nHowever, the National Organising Secretary is insisting as the head of organisation in the party that there is no need for a change of baton in the mobilisation because the primary elections are already very close.\n\nFollowing the disagreement, the PDP has suspended the planned appointment of a substantive director of mobilisation and organisation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has revealed Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja as the judge he uses for \u2018dirty jobs\u2019.\n\nWike had during the inauguration of the reconstructed 3.4km eastern bypass in Port Harcourt said he was behind the sacking of David Umahi as governor of Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cYou carry the vote of another party and join another party. Can you transfer votes? If you are defecting, leave the seat. And this will checkmate most of these political harlots who will never sit in one place, looking for excuses here and there.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take our property and say we should close our mouths. How can we close our mouths? And say those who are behind it. We are behind it.\n\n\u201cIf your friends don\u2019t want to tell you, me, I\u2019m involved. So, nobody should threaten us.

          "text": "On Friday, 3 Nigerian federal government agencies\u2014Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offences Commission (ICPC)\u2014collaborated with the Nigerian police force to raid some illegal financial institutions operating from their Opebi Road offices in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Punch, digital lending platforms like GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Easi Moni, KashKash, and Speedy Choice were among the busted companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe FCCPC, which led the joint operation, said the raid was a response to several customers\u2019 complaints about the malpractices carried out by financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking at the raid, the CEO at FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said the agency started investigating and monitoring these companies in 2020 when consumers started accusing them of mishandling and violating their private data in the process of loan recovery.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. When the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise of money lenders,\u201d Irukera said. \u201cBecause of the lockdown, people needed small and instant loans to sustain, which is understandable. But, over a period of time, people started to complain about the malpractice of the lenders so we started tracking it.\u201d\n\nIrukera also mentioned that, towards the end of last year, the agency had gathered a lot of information and started working with some other key agencies to monitor these businesses.\n\nAccording to Irukera, their findings so far are: the interest rate charged by these digital lenders appears to violate the ethics of how lending is done; secondly, the unethical loan recovery practice of violating customers\u2019 privacy to abuse and shame them and their acquaintances.\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms, which has been very difficult. These companies move around a lot, and it took us several months visiting each of their locations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FCCPC boss, however, said investigations also revealed that the loan firms weren\u2019t Nigerian nor registered in the country, they don\u2019t have an address nor do they have a licence to do business in Nigeria. He also said that most of these companies operated from the same place and by the same person.\n\nWith no address, all these companies have are mobile apps that can be downloaded on both Google and Apple Stores. So the agency had to engage the people who have been their victims and gather more evidence.\n\nBy now, all the agencies involved had gotten enough information and evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for them to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure.\n\n\u201cAnd sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation, which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we were hitting at the place where we could get many of them,\u201d said the FCCPC boss.\n\nHe also mentioned that the agency had issued an order to Apple and Google to take down these companies\u2019 apps from their platforms. It has also ordered the banks to freeze these companies\u2019 bank accounts.\n\nLast year, when NITDA sanctioned Sokoloan, TechCabal reported that that would be the first of many. Though it took longer than expected, it\u2019s finally happening.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones\u2014no. We want to start with them. We also understand that there are between 5 and 7 companies operating at the same location,\u201d said Irukera, hinting at the agency\u2019s ambition to cleanse the nation of all illegal digital lending practices.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cHoly f*ck.\u201d\n\nThat was what Beeple tweeted when \u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\u201d, his non-fungible Token (NFT) art and the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house, was bought for $69 million at Christie\u2019s in March last year. This event didn\u2019t only make Beeple the third richest artist in the world, it ushered in the beginning of a new era for the art world.\n\nWhile Beeple\u2019s was the most expensive JPEG NFT format, profile-pic NFT (PPF)\u2014NFTs that depict a portrait that can be used as a social media avatar\u2014also hit some record-breaking milestones. For example, Crypto Punk NFTs that were given out for free in 2017 at launch started trading for prices between $480,000 and $1.25 million in January 2021 and, by the end of the year, they wouldn\u2019t go for anything less than $4 million.\n\nThough NFT has been around since 2014, 2021 was the pivotal year for this \u201cnovelty and strange\u201d technology. It was the year it broke into the mainstream, disrupting the art world and waltzing its way into the hearts of almost every aspect of pop culture, from music to film to sports and literature.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile all of this was happening, a crop of young and curious African minds have also started to develop an appetite and build an NFT ecosystem on the continent. Although it felt\u2014still feels\u2014like a myth to the broader population, more people had started buying into it. Jacon Osinachi was well on his way to becoming the foremost NFT artist on the continent and, arguably, the world. Anthony Azekwoh would soon create and sell his first NFT \u201cThe Red Man\u201d, one of the most popular NFT pieces out of Africa. Zimbabwean Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, a digital art of late African-American entertainment and sports stars\u2014DMX, Kobe Bryant, Aaliyah, Chadwick Boseman, Tupac Shakur, and Nipsey Hussle\u2014would soon be picked up and displayed on a billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.\n\nSomewhere in Abuja, Nigeria, is Peace Ojemeh 24, a Nigerian product designer and an Open Source advocate, who, like everybody else, is trying to understand the \u201cinsanity\u201d around this technology, the reason anybody would spend millions of dollars on something intangible\u2014something they might never touch physically.\n\nWhile Ojemeh was still making sense of this, the original copy of \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d, a viral photo meme of a girl smirking as a fire roared behind her, sold for $500,000 (180 ETH at the time).\n\n\u201cReading about Disaster girl, a meme I casually use in my WhatsApp chats with friends, selling for such a ridiculous amount of dollars, was an awakening. I just knew I had to get in on NFTs,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nBut judging from Ojemeh\u2019s journey, this could have been all talk. That wasn\u2019t the first time Ojemeh would get excited about crypto and its related ventures. In 2017 and 2018, she had planned to buy her first ethereum (ETH) but ended up not going through with it.\n\nWhen she finally did something in the space, it was a disaster. She bought edcoin, a crypto token from a Nigerian blockchain company Edmark. She even convinced her mother and uncle to invest in it but a few months after, while ETH ballooned into over $1,000, Edcoin started dropping in value.\n\nBy 2020, it was obvious edcoin wasn\u2019t going anywhere so she began to think of how to flip this seemingly bad investment into a lucrative one. She withdrew her investment from edcoin into ETH and then into e-gold and some other coins that yielded positives. This experience exposed her to the slippery world of crypto and the learnings from it shaped how she approaches crypto today.\n\nFounding Haze Monkey Society\n\nSo instead of going right into NFTs after the \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d news, Ojemeh decided to learn about the industry, and invested in some NFTs to have access to their communities to understand how they function and are being managed. By the time she gathered enough knowledge, she reached out to her friend Alabo Briggs, 22, a blockchain engineer, about building their own NFT collection. Having done some work in NFT prior that time, Briggs got on board quickly with the idea and together.\n\nWith a bold ambition to build an NFT community as important as Crypto Punk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had built, the duo hit the ground running without looking back.\n\nSo, in August, while Pablo Stanley, one of the most respected product designers and doodlers in the world, was launching Robotos, a 10,000-robot NFT collection, and selling out, Ojemeh and Briggs started building a collection of stoned monkeys they would call Haze Monkey Society.\n\nHaze Monkey Society was launched as a collection of 4,200 NFTs focused on building a no-code platform aimed at empowering NFT creators and artists and making an environmental impact in Africa.\n\n\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, we needed to associate ourselves with a successful project while not being a complete replica. So with the success of BAYC, we chose to identify as monkeys,\u201d said Ojemeh. \u201cHaze indicates the weed-smoking culture among creatives. It\u2019s also an inspiration behind our unique number: 420.\u201d\n\nHaze Monkey has unique and rich storytelling built into each of its NFTs.\n\nA thoughtful roadmap\n\nOne of the things that determines the success of an NFT project is its community. And what makes a community thrive is the utilities, the benefits, that come from holding such NFT. Ojemeh and Briggs know this, and that\u2019s why they spent a lot of time deliberating on their roadmap.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just sell NFTs, we are keen on finding a way to provide value to Haze Monkey\u2019s holders,\u201d said Ojemeh, who also consults for the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, and the African Union on a project that exposes technology as a career path to girls across African countries.\n\nBesides access to an exclusive social community, there are 3 major benefits on Haze Monkey\u2019s roadmap. One of them is the no-code platform which Ojemeh said was born out of creating an environment where people don\u2019t need deep tech knowledge to harness the blockchain technology.\n\nThe next one is the animation series about Haze Monkey\u2019s unique stories where holders and community members will be characters. Lastly, the duo, having been born and bred in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where petroleum exploration in the area continues to pollute their water and atmosphere, decided to include something personal to them: they want to plant 100 trees somewhere in Africa for every single NFT minted.\n\nA learning curve that led to a new direction\n\nAbout 10 days before Haze Monkey NFTs would start its public minting in February, the team behind the project launched a countdown campaign and daily Twitter space discussion, where the community would come together, ask questions, calculate the societal impact of the project and, most importantly, the fortune it promises.\n\nThe minting calendar had been set; the public minting price was set at 0.08 ETH at a maximum of 4 NFTs per address and the presale price for those who had been whitelisted after performing some tasks or winning giveaways was pegged at 0.06 ETH at a maximum of 2 NFTs.\n\nIn one of those Twitter Spaces, a community member with a monkey avatar and a Mexican accent asked what would happen if the collection did not sell out within the opening week. For a few seconds, there was silence and one could tell he\u2019d ask an unexpected question. It was obvious the team hadn\u2019t considered this.\n\n\u201cWell, the plan is to sell out, but in a situation where we don\u2019t the community will decide what to do,\u201d answered Ashlei, one of the US-based community managers who was moderating the space.\n\nBefore the countdown campaign started, Haze Monkey had gathered over 5,000 organic social followers and over 6,000 Discord community members from across the globe. The project had also been listed and verified on 7 of the largest NFT platforms\u2014NFT Calendar, NFT Drop, NFT Evening, Coin Market Cap, Rarity, Next Drop, NFT Genie, and Rarity Sniper.\n\nWith this increasing traction at zero marketing budget, the possibility of not selling out was out of the question. But Haze Money did about 20%. Among other factors, this could be attributed to the recent scare of stolen NFTs that was happening on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace in the world.\n\nHowever, the slow movement couldn\u2019t deter the team as they\u2019ve quickly started looking for new strategies. They are currently iterating their roadmap to suite the new reality and as a result, the community have agreed to the reduction of the amount in circulation.\n\n\u201cAs a request from the community, our genesis collection was cut down to 1,242 with a vision of releasing the rest over time,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nShe also mentioned that the community had initially agreed to cap volume at 1, 000, but because of how significant 420 is to the project and its weed-cultured monkeys, the number 1,242 was chosen.\n\nHaze Monkey is now a collection of 1,242 NFTs.\n\nThough built by Africans in Africa, Haze Monkey has already positioned itself as a global brand. In its Discord group, the project has about 5 different channels for people who can\u2019t speak English. Its team members are also from across the world.\n\nThough there are African women in the NFT scene minting and selling their own NFT, there\u2019s none building a collection of NFT at the scale that Ojemeh and her team are doing.\n\nOjemeh believes that as they continue to build on the genesis collection and iterate their roadmap to benefit their community, there\u2019s nothing stopping Haze Monkey from becoming one of the most valuable NFTs in the $80 billion industry \u2014 and that their \u201choly f*ck\u201d moment will soon come.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "How Pivo is providing fast and reliable financial services for Africa\u2019s supply chain businesses",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 90% of businesses and 50% of employment globally. In addition, SMEs create 7 out of 10 jobs in emerging economies. Consequently, ensuring that SMEs have a good environment to thrive in is crucial for job creation and economic growth.\n\nHowever, an inability to access finance for their business operations means many SMEs have to close shop. In Nigeria, for example, banks are more likely to give loans to large businesses. Over the past five years, startups like FairMoney and Brass have stepped up, providing individuals and businesses with an alternative to existing financial institutions.\n\nLast year, Nigeria\u2019s fintech space saw a new entrant \u2013 Pivo. The startup was founded by Nkiru Amadi-Emina (CEO) and Ijeoma Akwiwu (COO) as a result of an observation the two women had. Before Pivo, Amadi-Emina had founded Jalo, a logistics startup that served businesses in Northern Nigeria until its acquisition by Kobo360.\n\nThe deal, an acqui-hire, saw Amadi-Emina join Kobo360, where she held various positions, including Port Operations Lead. Akwiwu, on her part, had spent most of her career working as a lawyer and building her private practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer jobs saw her working with various tech companies, and she was soon curious about other services a lawyer could offer startups. Seeing this interest, a friend offered her the opportunity to work on a project to curb corruption in Nigeria\u2019s judicial sector. While the project never saw the light of day, it gave her more insight into opportunities in the tech space and led her to get a master\u2019s in software engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNkiru Amadi-Emina (CEO) and Ijeoma Akwiwu (COO) of Pivo Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nThe duo also ran businesses together, and their experience showed them that many small businesses in the supply chain industry struggled with financing. Trying to solve that problem led them to start Pivo.\n\n\u201cHaving worked at Kobo360 and then also built a source procurement product together, we found that a lot of the small players in both scenarios have issues with financing or completing transactions that they get.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a case of they don\u2019t have any business or orders; nobody is giving them cargo to load or orders to fulfil. They had it but didn\u2019t have the financial capital to fulfil it. Having noticed that problem, we decided to build Pivo to provide them with adequate financial support,\u201d Amadi-Emina told Techpoint Africa.\n\nFinancial services for supply chain SMEs\n\nPivo is a financial services provider targeted at SMEs in Africa\u2019s supply chain sector. The decision to focus on businesses in the supply chain sector comes from the founders\u2019 expertise working in the industry and an understanding that there\u2019s a supply chain segment to most sectors of the African economy.\n\n\u201cWe have experience in the supply chain industry. We also understand that a supply chain is a function that cuts across multiple sectors, whether you\u2019re in manufacturing, agriculture, or oil and gas. More importantly, in any supply chain, the actors remain the same,\u201d Amadi-Emina said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of Pivo\u2019s website\n\nWhile other startups provide businesses with working capital, what sets Pivo apart is its focus on a set of businesses. The startup has rolled out its first offering \u2013 Pivo Capital \u2013 a loan service for supply chain businesses, but it is not stopping at that. It plans to offer every financial service that a supply chain business needs, including inventory financing, corporate account services, asset financing, etc.\n\nSince its private beta launched in July 2021, the startup has gotten over 250 clients (200 of which are active), received loan requests of over $2 million, and disbursed over $700,000 to date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially bootstrapped by the co-founders, the startup has raised an undisclosed pre-seed round from investors including Mercy Corps Ventures, Microtraction, Ventures Platform, FirstCheck Africa, and Bold Angel Fund. Pivo has also gotten into the ODX accelerator programme, where it will receive $125,000 for 7% equity.\n\nThe startup has three core products \u2013 Pivo Capital, Pivo Finance, and Pivo Plus. For Pivo Capital, the startup charges an interest rate and management fee on all loans disbursed. The interest rates are not fixed and vary depending on the loan amount and the company involved. However, Akwiwu disclosed that the minimum interest rate is 3%.\n\nFor Pivo Finance, the startup\u2019s corporate banking service, the startup plans to provide businesses with account numbers, wallets, and the ability to conduct transactions using their Pivo accounts. Although not all the offerings are currently available, the startup plans to charge transaction fees on any transaction done using Pivo.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nCurrently operating in Lagos, the startup has its eyes on Nigeria\u2019s other commercial cities, including Port Harcourt, Abuja, and Kano, before expanding to other African countries, starting with Ghana in Q4 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Pivo staff educating a customer on Pivo\u2019s services\n\nLike any business, the startup has faced its fair share of challenges, including keeping up with the growth of its loan portfolio and hiring the right talent. On keeping up with its loan portfolio, Akwiwu said the company has had to work closely with its financial partners.\n\n\u201cI think the major problem we\u2019ve had is primarily around keeping up with the growth that we are seeing. An example is that your loan portfolio is growing, but do you have enough capital to support that growth? One of the ways we\u2019re mitigating it is quickly activating credit lines with financial partners at the same pace of our portfolio growth.\u201d\n\nOn the talent front, Akwiwu revealed that the startup still has most of its founding team, while Amadi-Emina shared that they have been intentional about their hires.\n\n\u201cOne thing we try to do is to be deliberate and intentional about hiring because what you find is, if you make the right hire, they\u2019re able to compensate for other gaps in your structure,\u201d Akwiwu added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCadana is a platform that allows African workers to get paid on demand instead of waiting till the end of the month, unlocking their earnings in real-time.\u201d \u2014 Albert Owusu-Asare, Cadana CEO.\n\nDigitising payroll and human resources (HR) is one of the many services that Cadana offers, but the true mission of the startup is to accelerate wealth building for African workers by making their earnings available to them when they need it.\n\nIn a conversation with Techpoint Africa, Cadana Co-founder and CEO, Owusu-Asare, discussed his motivation for creating the startup and why he thinks on-demand salary could help Africans accelerate wealth creation.\n\nGrowing up in Ghana, Owusu-Asare came from a modest background and, at an early age, knew how vital payday was. He recalled how families waited earnestly for the day their pay would come in to sort out financial problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could see first hand how my parents were working very hard to make sure we got the best experiences growing up. From there, I observed the role that jobs played in our lives.\u201d\n\nBuilding Cadana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana Co-Founder. L-R. Owusu-Asare and Ameer Shujjah\n\nOwusu-Asare has a wealth of experience in the fintech world, and Cadana isn\u2019t the first fintech he has been a part of. He was the CTO and Co-founder of Esusu, a New York-headquartered startup that became a unicorn in January 2022.\n\nBut his finance journey didn\u2019t start at Esusu; it began at Goldman Sachs. Owusu-Asare left Ghana for the US to study. There, he met a friend \u2014 Ameer Shujjah \u2014 who would become his Co-founder and CTO at Cadana.\n\nShujjah and Owusu-Asare were the only computer science and physics majors in the university they attended. And their love for computer science and physics bolstered their friendship over a decade.\n\nAfter university, Owusu-Asare took to Wall Street and landed a job with Goldman Sachs. He was an engineer at the investment bank and helped build a digital lending platform there. Through this, he became one of the first engineers to work on the Apple Card.\n\n\u201cIt was a joint partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs to create a very modern credit card experience for millions of Americans, and that, to me, was when my journey with credit began.\u201d\n\nHe drew upon his experience with Apple Card when he became the CTO at Esusu. What Esusu does is to help low and middle-income earners in the US survive the credit system the country was built on.\n\n\u201cIn America, everything is tied to the credit score; if your credit score drops, you\u2019re done. So many low to middle-income earners were trapped in this credit score cycle. So, every time people pay their rent every month, we use it as a mechanism to help them improve their credit score.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEsusu\u2019s success opened Owusu-Asare\u2019s eyes to how technology can create access to wealth-building opportunities, and he left the US to bring those opportunities to Africa.\n\n\u201cI left Esusu because I just had a passion for Africa.\u201d\n\nWhy Cadana?\n\nOwusu-Asare thought of several ways to impact the African continent significantly, and Cadana came to mind. To him, Africa\u2019s greatest resource is its people, and they must get access to funds when they need them.\n\n\u201cVery similar to Esusu, I realised that the monthly pay cycle is something that has been on for years or even centuries. I thought, why do we pay people once a month?\n\n\u201cToday you can order an Uber right to your doorstep; you can sit in your home and order food at the touch of a button. Why can\u2019t salaries be as real-time as Uber? That was where the idea started.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to assume Cadana is a platform that provides credit access to salary earners, but it is not. It simply gives them access to their salary before the payday.\n\nHow does Cadana work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana website\n\nWhile Cadana provides salary on-demand, there are limits to the time and amount of the salary that can be demanded. Owusu-Asare said, \u201cWe understand that certain guardrails need to be put in place so that you can be as efficient with your money as possible.\n\n\u201cWhat Cadana does is to partner with your business; we always go through your employer so that we understand where you work and how much you earn. Certain employers tell us they want to give employees access to 50% of their money or 30% of their money.\n\n\u201cWe also work with the employer to put a transaction limit so people do not abuse it. So these are the control measures we have put in.\u201d\n\nEssentially, employees do not have to pay any form of interest for getting their salary early. Cadana pays the salary and gets the money back from the employer when the payment is due.\n\nSo how does Cadana makes money?\n\nIt is essential to see Cadana as a payment platform and a salary on-demand platform. The platform makes its money by charging a transaction fee of $1 (\u20a6415) whenever salary is demanded.\n\nOwusu-Asare explained that the transaction fee is split between Cadana and its payment partners.\n\n\u201cWe work with our payment partners to actually disperse the money to their bank accounts or in Ghana to their mobile money accounts. Part of that fee goes to the payment providers, and we put a spread on what we do.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Cadana also offers a gamut of payment services from which it makes money. According to Owusu-Asare, it is a very holistic all in one platform that allows businesses to run payroll, pay vendors and suppliers, and generate invoices.\n\nWith these multiple streams of income, he said the company has a sustainable business model which will help them add more value to the employee.\n\n\u201cOur biggest value proposition is always the employee and the experience we are giving to them.\u201d\n\nHow Cadana stands out from the crowd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana website home-page\n\nWhen it comes to digitising payroll and HR, Cadana is in the same league as Bento and SeamlessHR. However, its on-demand salary offering sets it apart. In explaining how Cadana\u2019s positioning is different from others, Owusu-Asare said, \u201cWe are positioning ourselves first and foremost as a payment company.\n\n\u201cOur positioning is actually powerful because by making the businesses and their money movement as efficient as possible, you can pass on some of those efficiency gains to employees.\u201d\n\nWhile Cadana stands out from the payroll and HR crowd with its on-demand salary and payment services, it\u2019s still in the same boat with Earnipay, another on-demand salary platform that recently raised a $4 million seed round.\n\nJust like Cadana, Earnipay charges transaction fees between \u20a6250 and \u20a6450 ($0.60 and $1.08) for processing transactions.\n\nHowever, Owusu-Asare assured that in the coming months, Cadana would have product offerings that offer salary on-demand and services like payment and investment that will complete its mission of wealth acquisition.\n\nRisks and challenges to offering on-demand salaries in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana team\n\nCadana launched in Ghana but has expanded to Nigeria as part of a partnership with African fintech giant, Flutterwave. But how easy is it to offer these services in Africa, or perhaps what does Cadana do when employers do not pay salaries after an employee has demanded salary?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be risks, but we focus a lot on employers that pay their people on time and are forward-thinking,\u201d Owusu-Asare said.\n\nWhile focusing on employers that pay on time could reduce the risks for Cadana, he also admitted that the space Cadana is playing in is new, and businesses that they onboard have to be educated.\n\n\u201cWe have internal teams that spend a lot of time with these businesses, trying to help them understand that their employees can spend over five hours at work dealing with their financial issues instead of working.\n\n\u201cWe also try to help them understand that when an employee quits or gets sacked for being unproductive, they actually spend a lot more money replacing that person.\u201d\n\nEducating employers on the importance of a healthy relationship then becomes the major challenge for Cadana, an obstacle Owusu-Asare believes they will overcome in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

So, those were the two things that we set out to look for.\u201d\n\nThe adoption and implementation of data protection and privacy laws in Nigeria seem to be gaining momentum and is creating more awareness around it. Hopefully, more moves are made to protect citizens\u2019 privacy.\n\nFighting racially-biased technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my second trick, I\u2019ll be stringing together three words to make a story: Artificial Intelligence (AI), bias, race. Okay, let\u2019s make that four words.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the big idea? Despite the supposed infallibility of AI, it relies on datasets it has been fed. Essentially, the technology is only as smart as the data it is given, at first at least. It is expected that it grows and learns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, issues arise when the data contains some level of bias. This could take different forms, and for Africans or black people, it often results in discrimination or unrepresentative information.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) launched the \u201cfirst-ever\u201d African Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence (ARCAI) in the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe centre is located in the Denis Sassou-N\u2019guesso University of Kint\u00e9l\u00e9 and offers a Masters of Science Degree in Artificial Intelligence and data science in collaboration with the university.\n\nIn 2019, Google launched an AI lab in Ghana, hoping to foster more African involvement in the development of AI and reduce bias. Also, in 2018, Data Science Nigeria created Nigeria\u2019s first AI hub.\n\nAlthough not the first, the establishment of the ARCAI is a step in the right direction in solving the issue of racial abuse and AI.\n\nWhat you missed last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a great week!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "2023 election: Nigeria\u2019s digital infrastructure faces biggest test",
          "text": "For Emmanuel Yemgbe, a 29-year-old Nigerian, who joined over 1.3 million registered voters in the country\u2019s capital to vote in the last local government election, the experience with the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) was frustrating.\n\nHe had got to the polling unit at 7:00 am, hoping to avoid the long queue. But it wasn\u2019t to be, as the election \u2013 the first to be organised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) this year \u2013 witnessed a large turnout. He was assigned a number above 50 when he got to the centre. Unfortunately, the voting materials and INEC officials did not arrive until 10:00 am for a process that was scheduled to start at 8:30 am.\n\nOnce the voting kicked off, voters faced a new challenge: the INEC machines were taking time to capture people, and at some point, there was a long break because the face recognition machine malfunctioned and the INEC official had to put a call through to one of the engineers.\n\nBVAS is a successor to Z-Pad, which INEC deployed in the Edo State governorship off-cycle election in 2020. It combines voter enrolment, voter accreditation, and results interface capabilities in one device. Theoretically, this should eliminate the gaps that enable analogue manipulation of numbers in elections.\n\n\u201cWhen it was my turn, the machines were first malfunctioning and not picking up thumbprints and face identification until the technicians took more than 40 minutes for me to complete thumbprint, facial recognition, and actual voting,\u201d Yemgbe told BusinessDay.\n\nDamilola Babatola, one of the National Youth Service Corps members who functioned as a polling unit officer in one of the six wards in Abuja, said there were several reasons why the machine malfunctioned. She said the chief reason was the unwillingness of some voters to cooperate with the machine requirements.\n\nFor example, facial recognition would not capture people frowning or those with scarves on their heads or excess makeup.\n\nBabatola, however, acknowledged that the machines did malfunction, saying the officials had to call the engineers for help each time.\n\nImportantly, the officials needed to ensure that the area where the polling unit is located has access to the internet, otherwise, it will be impossible to carry out the voting process.\n\nSo far, INEC has tested the voting technology in three states, namely Delta (Isoko South 1 State Constituency Bye-election), Anambra (gubernatorial election), and Abuja (LGA elections). In Anambra, the complaints were very similar to what voters experienced in Abuja.\n\nDigital infrastructure and credible election\n\nSince the turn of the democratic era in 1999 \u2013 or any era before that, Nigeria has had little or no success regarding the conduct of credible elections. Now, for the 2023 elections, the country is putting all its eggs in digital technology to deliver what it most craves. The country now has a refurbished electoral law that approves the use of the electronic voting system for the general elections next year.\n\nIt will be the first election that voters will be required to register online, carry out 90 percent of the entire voting process using machines with human interference reduced to the barest, and the election results will be transmitted via online channels \u2013 again removing human influences.\n\nVoters like Yemgbe agree that electronic voting is the best strategy to reduce, if not totally eliminate, electoral malfeasance. But they are skeptical about the health of the machines and whether the country has enough infrastructure to go around when the big election comes calling in February next year.\n\nExperts also say the existing digital infrastructure in the country faces its biggest test ever, with the general elections looming.\n\n\u201cFibre infrastructure is key to stable and uninterrupted internet access, which is key to the proper functioning of the electronic voting materials,\u201d said Rotimi Akapo, partner and head of telecommunications, media and technology practice group at Advocaat Law Practice. \u201cThis is why the resolution of the issues around the reasonable provision of access to Right of Way (RoW) by states is important. Most telcos and independent infrastructure providers are ready to deploy fibre but the RoW issue is a major obstacle to deployment.\u201d\n\nWhile the 3G network is the minimum requirement to power BVAS, it does not deliver seamless service for the technology. For example, during the gubernatorial election in Anambra, INEC\u2019s presiding officials in one of the communities called Dunukofia, which is mostly covered by 3G networks, had to enlist local commercial motorcyclists to take them to neighbouring communities, where they could access the 4G network to download BVAS updates.\n\n\u201cBVAS is like an Android phone; it needs to show 4G to show that it is connected,\u201d Babatola said.\n\nIn cases where the network assigned to them by INEC failed, they had to put on their mobile hotspot to access the 4G network.\n\nThe 4G network requirement could present a difficult challenge for INEC officials in the general elections, given that 4G infrastructure covers only about 10 percent of the population. What that means is that in places without 4G infrastructure, the officials would not be able to get the required BVAS update to carry on with their work.\n\nWole Abu, chief executive officer of Liquid Telecom Nigeria, told BusinessDay that in view of the election, there was an urgent need for accelerated fibre and base tower station (BTS) deployments.\n\nCurrently, only about 10 percent of BTS are connected by fibre.\n\nHe estimates that Nigeria requires $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion to achieve its digital infrastructure requirements.\n\nThe World Bank has also noted that the total estimated incremental investment required for the delivery of the plan over the next five years across all categories is estimated at below $5 billion. The resultant impact of this investment based on the planned 30-40 percent increase in broadband penetration is estimated at up to five percent of GDP or approximately $25 billion.\n\nThe country requires about 120,000km of fibre infrastructure to deliver high-speed internet but it currently has 54,725km available, leaving 65,275km as the deficit. To fund the deficit, experts estimate that it will cost about $13,500 per km of fibre, which amounts to about $1.1 billion.\n\nElectronic voting in other countries\n\nChidi Odinkalu, professor of Practice in International Human Rights Law at the Fletcher School, Tufts University, Massachusetts, recently noted that BVAS, being a technology solution based on artificial intelligence, is only as good as both the age of the data and the training that the algorithms receive.\n\nTherefore, according to him, the use of the technology as a solution on the scale required for credible election administration in Nigeria is challenging, given its flawed reputation and at a time when many of its pioneers are pulling back from it.\n\nGermany, Ireland, Paraguay and the Netherlands are among countries that dumped e-voting and reverted to old voting systems. The Netherlands, for example, went back to using paper ballots in 2007, after anti-e-voting activities showed that it was not secure, using experimental hacking.\n\nGermany stopped using voting machines in 2009 after a constitutional court ruled they were not transparent enough. Norway tried internet votes between 2011 and 2013 but decided not to use them because of public perceptions on the security of the vote.\n\nRead also: \u2018Not voting is still a vote, for the status quo\u2019 \u2013 Ayisha Osori\n\nHowever, Poynter Institute, an international media institute, reports that there are about 25 countries in the world where electronic voting is working efficiently. For example, since 2000, 100 percent of Brazilian voters have used the electronic system and Poynter claims that no fraud has been confirmed so far. The adoption of electronic voting in Brazil also led to growth in electoral participation, and the number of people disenfranchised reduced drastically.\n\nHowever, Brazil\u2019s achievement in electronic voting is only possible because as of January 2022, internet penetration stood at 77.87 percent, compared to Nigeria\u2019s 41 percent as of December 2021.\n\nAlso, unlike Nigeria\u2019s 54,725km of fibre, Brazil has 400,000km fibre backbone, which is present in more than 2,300 municipalities in the country. The country also had 94,442 base tower stations (BTS) as of 2019, compared to Nigeria\u2019s 53,460 in 2021.\n\nFunding digital infrastructure\n\nIn its annual report, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said capital inflow (foreign direct investment) into the Nigerian telecoms industry dropped by 125.8 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. The industry had deployed $942.8 million in 2019, only to see it drop to $417.4 million in 2020.\n\nAbu said investment in digital infrastructure had reduced because of the absence of supporting infrastructures such as road network and power, leading to high capital and operating expenditures for rural connectivity.\n\nPeople in low-income and underserved areas are about 70 percent of the digitally excluded population. Investors are also discouraged by the widespread insecurity in the country.\n\nThe National Executive Council had moved to stimulate investment in digital infrastructure with the State Accelerated Broadband Initiative included in the National Broadband Plan 2020-2025. The initiative was designed to address the infrastructure deficits in the telecoms sector and required the creation of an N265 billion fund.\n\nThe NCC will support the infrastructure companies (InfraCos) responsible for deploying broadband, with a subsidy of N65 billion, while the InfraCos would raise the remaining N200 billion.\n\n\u201cSome licensees have returned their licences because they are unable to provide advance counterpart funding, which is a condition precedent to receiving NCC funds,\u201d Abu said.\n\nAccording to Akapo, the government does not need to spend money on infrastructure but it can create a conducive environment for telecom investors to be attracted to deploy capital.\n\nSome of the major issues investors need government intervention include foreign exchange, multiple taxation, forward-looking regulation, RoW fee, proper and stable policy implementation.\n\n\u201cEasy repatriation of profit is also important as investors will not invest where they have to jump through hoops to repatriate profits,\u201d Akapo said. \u201cGovernment does not even need to spend a kobo. They should just deal with the issues above. The telcos and independent infrastructure providers will invest as long as they are sure they will reap the fruits of their investments.\u201d",

Theoretically, this should eliminate the gaps that enable analogue manipulation of numbers in elections.\n\n\u201cWhen it was my turn, the machines were first malfunctioning and not picking up thumbprints and face identification until the technicians took more than 40 minutes for me to complete thumbprint, facial recognition, and actual voting,\u201d Yemgbe told BusinessDay.\n\nDamilola Babatola, one of the National Youth Service Corps members who functioned as a polling unit officer in one of the six wards in Abuja, said there were several reasons why the machine malfunctioned. She said the chief reason was the unwillingness of some voters to cooperate with the machine requirements.\n\nFor example, facial recognition would not capture people frowning or those with scarves on their heads or excess makeup.\n\nBabatola, however, acknowledged that the machines did malfunction, saying the officials had to call the engineers for help each time.\n\nImportantly, the officials needed to ensure that the area where the polling unit is located has access to the internet, otherwise, it will be impossible to carry out the voting process.\n\nSo far, INEC has tested the voting technology in three states, namely Delta (Isoko South 1 State Constituency Bye-election), Anambra (gubernatorial election), and Abuja (LGA elections). In Anambra, the complaints were very similar to what voters experienced in Abuja.\n\nDigital infrastructure and credible election\n\nSince the turn of the democratic era in 1999 \u2013 or any era before that, Nigeria has had little or no success regarding the conduct of credible elections. Now, for the 2023 elections, the country is putting all its eggs in digital technology to deliver what it most craves. The country now has a refurbished electoral law that approves the use of the electronic voting system for the general elections next year.\n\nIt will be the first election that voters will be required to register online, carry out 90 percent of the entire voting process using machines with human interference reduced to the barest, and the election results will be transmitted via online channels \u2013 again removing human influences.\n\nVoters like Yemgbe agree that electronic voting is the best strategy to reduce, if not totally eliminate, electoral malfeasance. But they are skeptical about the health of the machines and whether the country has enough infrastructure to go around when the big election comes calling in February next year.\n\nExperts also say the existing digital infrastructure in the country faces its biggest test ever, with the general elections looming.\n\n\u201cFibre infrastructure is key to stable and uninterrupted internet access, which is key to the proper functioning of the electronic voting materials,\u201d said Rotimi Akapo, partner and head of telecommunications, media and technology practice group at Advocaat Law Practice. \u201cThis is why the resolution of the issues around the reasonable provision of access to Right of Way (RoW) by states is important. Most telcos and independent infrastructure providers are ready to deploy fibre but the RoW issue is a major obstacle to deployment.\u201d\n\nWhile the 3G network is the minimum requirement to power BVAS, it does not deliver seamless service for the technology. For example, during the gubernatorial election in Anambra, INEC\u2019s presiding officials in one of the communities called Dunukofia, which is mostly covered by 3G networks, had to enlist local commercial motorcyclists to take them to neighbouring communities, where they could access the 4G network to download BVAS updates.\n\n\u201cBVAS is like an Android phone; it needs to show 4G to show that it is connected,\u201d Babatola said.\n\nIn cases where the network assigned to them by INEC failed, they had to put on their mobile hotspot to access the 4G network.\n\nThe 4G network requirement could present a difficult challenge for INEC officials in the general elections, given that 4G infrastructure covers only about 10 percent of the population. What that means is that in places without 4G infrastructure, the officials would not be able to get the required BVAS update to carry on with their work.\n\nWole Abu, chief executive officer of Liquid Telecom Nigeria, told BusinessDay that in view of the election, there was an urgent need for accelerated fibre and base tower station (BTS) deployments.\n\nCurrently, only about 10 percent of BTS are connected by fibre.\n\nHe estimates that Nigeria requires $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion to achieve its digital infrastructure requirements.\n\nThe World Bank has also noted that the total estimated incremental investment required for the delivery of the plan over the next five years across all categories is estimated at below $5 billion. The resultant impact of this investment based on the planned 30-40 percent increase in broadband penetration is estimated at up to five percent of GDP or approximately $25 billion.\n\nThe country requires about 120,000km of fibre infrastructure to deliver high-speed internet but it currently has 54,725km available, leaving 65,275km as the deficit. To fund the deficit, experts estimate that it will cost about $13,500 per km of fibre, which amounts to about $1.1 billion.\n\nElectronic voting in other countries\n\nChidi Odinkalu, professor of Practice in International Human Rights Law at the Fletcher School, Tufts University, Massachusetts, recently noted that BVAS, being a technology solution based on artificial intelligence, is only as good as both the age of the data and the training that the algorithms receive.\n\nTherefore, according to him, the use of the technology as a solution on the scale required for credible election administration in Nigeria is challenging, given its flawed reputation and at a time when many of its pioneers are pulling back from it.\n\nGermany, Ireland, Paraguay and the Netherlands are among countries that dumped e-voting and reverted to old voting systems. The Netherlands, for example, went back to using paper ballots in 2007, after anti-e-voting activities showed that it was not secure, using experimental hacking.\n\nGermany stopped using voting machines in 2009 after a constitutional court ruled they were not transparent enough. Norway tried internet votes between 2011 and 2013 but decided not to use them because of public perceptions on the security of the vote.\n\nRead also: \u2018Not voting is still a vote, for the status quo\u2019 \u2013 Ayisha Osori\n\nHowever, Poynter Institute, an international media institute, reports that there are about 25 countries in the world where electronic voting is working efficiently. For example, since 2000, 100 percent of Brazilian voters have used the electronic system and Poynter claims that no fraud has been confirmed so far. The adoption of electronic voting in Brazil also led to growth in electoral participation, and the number of people disenfranchised reduced drastically.\n\nHowever, Brazil\u2019s achievement in electronic voting is only possible because as of January 2022, internet penetration stood at 77.87 percent, compared to Nigeria\u2019s 41 percent as of December 2021.\n\nAlso, unlike Nigeria\u2019s 54,725km of fibre, Brazil has 400,000km fibre backbone, which is present in more than 2,300 municipalities in the country. The country also had 94,442 base tower stations (BTS) as of 2019, compared to Nigeria\u2019s 53,460 in 2021.\n\nFunding digital infrastructure\n\nIn its annual report, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said capital inflow (foreign direct investment) into the Nigerian telecoms industry dropped by 125.8 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. The industry had deployed $942.8 million in 2019, only to see it drop to $417.4 million in 2020.\n\nAbu said investment in digital infrastructure had reduced because of the absence of supporting infrastructures such as road network and power, leading to high capital and operating expenditures for rural connectivity.\n\nPeople in low-income and underserved areas are about 70 percent of the digitally excluded population. Investors are also discouraged by the widespread insecurity in the country.\n\nThe National Executive Council had moved to stimulate investment in digital infrastructure with the State Accelerated Broadband Initiative included in the National Broadband Plan 2020-2025. The initiative was designed to address the infrastructure deficits in the telecoms sector and required the creation of an N265 billion fund.\n\nThe NCC will support the infrastructure companies (InfraCos) responsible for deploying broadband, with a subsidy of N65 billion, while the InfraCos would raise the remaining N200 billion.\n\n\u201cSome licensees have returned their licences because they are unable to provide advance counterpart funding, which is a condition precedent to receiving NCC funds,\u201d Abu said.\n\nAccording to Akapo, the government does not need to spend money on infrastructure but it can create a conducive environment for telecom investors to be attracted to deploy capital.\n\nSome of the major issues investors need government intervention include foreign exchange, multiple taxation, forward-looking regulation, RoW fee, proper and stable policy implementation.\n\n\u201cEasy repatriation of profit is also important as investors will not invest where they have to jump through hoops to repatriate profits,\u201d Akapo said. \u201cGovernment does not even need to spend a kobo. They should just deal with the issues above. The telcos and independent infrastructure providers will invest as long as they are sure they will reap the fruits of their investments.\u201d",

          "text": "The electoral methods Nigeria has chosen since the turn of democratic rule in 1999 have failed to deliver one of the basic ingredients of a democratic dispensation: credible elections.\n\nThe new electoral law assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari is considered as being capable of delivering credible elections.\n\nWhile this is the first time the country would be using internet-enabled machines to begin and end the voting process, authorities have made efforts in the past to introduce some form of innovations to the electoral process to ensure a level of credibility; however, their dependency on human actors were their pitfalls.\n\nThe administration of democratic elections in Nigeria dates back to the period before Independence when the Electoral Commission of Nigeria (ECN) was inaugurated in 1958 to conduct the 1959 federal elections.\n\nThe technology that was used during this period was manual balloting, which lasted until 2015 when the smart card reader method was introduced. Manual voting involves voter registration, voter register exhibition, voting, vote counting, collation, and publication of results.\n\nRegistration of voters enables eligible voters to have their names entered into a document (Voter Register), with the aim of offering the person the opportunity to exercise their franchise on the appointed day of voting. Nigerian law states that an eligible voter is one who is 18 years of age or above, a national and resident in the country.\n\nMaterials used by the ECN to register eligible voters during the period under review include scannable forms, pencils, photographs (or thumbprints) of the voter, and indelible ink. The Voter Register is considered provisional, so that changes may be made, until such time when it has been pushed to the Voter Register Exhibition stage.\n\nBarcodes are to help detect forged registration forms to enable the validity of the forms to be easily ascertained.\n\nThere is also the use of indelible ink to guard against double registration and a unique voter registration number, which is given to every registrant.\n\nThe exhibition of the voter register involves the display at each polling station once the registration is over. This is for the public to come and check that there are no discrepancies.\n\nResearch shows that to a large extent, the success of an election is determined by how accurate the voter register is.\n\nVoting (manual) is the actual process of casting ballots. Eligible voters go to the polling station where their names are registered and show their voter identification cards to the polling officials for inspection. Based on the (unique) voter registration numbers on the cards, the officials look up the names of the voters.\n\nWhen it is ensured that no votes have been cast by the voters, they are issued ballot papers with the left thumbs marked with indelible ink to indicate that they have voted.\n\nIn an enclosed space, they select their candidates of choice on the given ballot papers and thumbprints in the space allotted for the candidates. The voters then carefully fold the ballot papers (to avoid the fingerprint soiling other parts) and deposit them into the ballot boxes provided.\n\nRead also: INEC to fix BVAS, other impediments before 2023 polls\n\nVote counting and publication of results \u2013 ballot counting is done manually, with results collated through a bottom-up process. This means that counting is first done at the lowest level (the polling station level) and the results are collated from that level up to the constituency level and then to the national level.\n\nAt the highest level, the overall votes of various candidates are ascertained. After this, the ECN publishes the final results.\n\nSmart card reader\n\nIn the buildup to the 2015 general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) introduced smart card readers for the verification of voters and their voting cards to minimise the incidence of fraud and rigging.\n\nThe INEC card reader is a portable electronic voting authentication device configured to read only the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) issued by the electoral body. The card reader was designed for the accreditation process to collate the authentication of eligible voters before voting.\n\nThe automated fingerprint identification system was used in the 2011 general elections to eliminate multiple registrations from the voter list, but it was not capable of verifying the identity of voters at the polling stations.\n\nConsequently, INEC adopted the use of the permanent voter card (PVC) system and introduced smart card reader technology, a device used to scan PVCs to verify the identity of voters at the polling booth.\n\nDuring the elections, two new technologies that are more advanced were introduced. The PVCs contain voters\u2019 biometric information in an embedded microchip and replace the temporary voter\u2019s card that was used in the 2011 general elections.\n\nElectronic card readers were also used to accredit voters for the first time in the 2015 general elections. The electronic card readers were used to verify that the presented PVCs are legitimate and that the voter presenting the card is registered at that polling unit.\n\nThe card readers will also display a picture of the voter, so that poll workers can visually confirm the identity of the voter against the card, and allow for scanning of fingerprints to check the voter\u2019s fingerprints against the biometric information contained in the PVC.\n\nIt is positioned by its operators to read the embedded chip on the voter\u2019s PVC. The card is placed into the device, which then displays the voter\u2019s details. The voter places a thumb on the device, and his or her identity is confirmed through fingerprint authentication, which takes about 10 to 20 seconds to validate a voter.\n\nOn completion of the accreditation process, a \u2018Close V\u2019 key is used to complete the accreditation process and the total number of voters accredited can be previewed using a \u2018Query\u2019 key, and the result can be forwarded to INEC using the \u2018Communication\u2019 key.\n\nBVAS machine\n\nThe biometric voter accreditation system (BVAS) is a device that replaces the smart card reader, which was used in 2015. INEC decided to use this technology in the 2023 elections but made its first outing in the Isoko South I State Constituency Bye-election in Delta State on September 11, 2021.\n\nThe goal of the BVAS, according to Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, is to guard against identity theft where one person uses another person\u2019s PVC to vote using the incident form.\n\nAlthough there are controversies regarding the success of this technology, as some experts say it is geospatially dependent, since it has only been used in three locations. Also, it will require a strong connection around 4G to function effectively.\n\nAs Nigerians anticipate the 2023 presidential election, which will capture a larger percentage of the population, there\u2019s a call on INEC to put necessary measures in place to avoid hitches as seen in the previous elections where the BVAS machines were deployed.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAbuja \u2013 The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has denied alleged failure of the integrity test on the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\n\nASUU President, Mr Emmauel Osodeke, said this in a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday in Abuja.\n\nOsodeke was reacting to recent statements credited to both the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy and Director-General, NITDA that UTAS had failed the integrity test.\n\n\u201cThis press statement is necessitated by the need for ASUU to put the records straight on the grounds already covered in our patriotic struggle to get the government to deploy UTAS as a suitable solution for salary payment in our university system.\n\n\u201cLet us put it on record that an integrity test was carried out by NITDA on Aug. 10, 2021 in NUC where relevant government agencies and all the end-users in the University system were present.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the exercise, all, without exception, expressed satisfaction with UTAS as a suitable solution for salary payment in our universities.\n\n\u201cThis was attested to by the report coming from NITDA then to the effect that UTAS scored 85 per cent in User Acceptance Test (UAT), \u2018\u2019he said.\n\nAccording to him, in a curious twist of submission, the NITDA Technical Team, after conducting a comprehensive functionality test came out to say that out of 687 test cases, 529 cases were satisfactory, 156 cases queried and 2 cases cautioned.\n\nHe added that taking this report on its face value, the percentage score was 77 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe question that arises from this is: Can 77 per cent in any known fair evaluation system be categorized as failure?\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say here that some observations and questions were raised by NITDA to which UTAS technical team has to provide clarification. As we speak, our engagement with NITDA over the second round of testing continues.\n\n\u201cThe union is worried that while this exercise is going on, the Minister and the DG, NITDA went to press after FEC meeting of Wednesday, 9 March, 2022, to mislead the nation that UTAS has failed the integrity test.\n\n\u201cWe wish to draw your attention to the fact that NITDA gave a report to the fact that NITDA gave the report that UTAS did well in both the integrity test and user acceptability verification.\n\n\u201cClearly, 85 per cent and 77 per cent are high class grades in any known evaluation system.\n\n\u201cIn their desperation to justify their false assertions, they threw up issues such as Data centre and hosting of UTAS software which are clearly outside the rubrics of ASUU\u2019s responsibilities in the deployment of UTAS, \u2019\u2019he said.\n\nOsodeke said that ASUU and NITDA were still engaged in the testing process and that it was pertinent to note that one of the core mandates of NITDA is to encourage local content development.\n\nHe, therefore, said that NITDA had to discharge its responsibility to ensure that the solution developed by Nigerian academics was deployed\n\nHe added that, in doing so, the principles of transparency should be adhered to by making available to the public the set of criteria or benchmarks for certification of information technology application in the country.\n\nHe also appealed to the DG, NITDA to stop making comments capable of jeopardising the joint on-going testing of UTAS between the NITDA Technical Team and its counterparts.\n\n\u201cHowever, if this behaviour continues, we will have no choice but to demand that the NITDA Technical Report on UTAS and our Union\u2019s response be made public in order to shed more light on the ongoing controversies without further waste of time.\n\n\u201cThe DG, NITDA and the minister superintending the agency are challenged to a public discussion on any national media to put all matters to rest for the benefit of our students, union members, and the Nigerian public in general,\u2019\u2019he said.\n\nHe added that on the ongoing strike, the union had been having engagements with the government over the contending issues that necessitated it in the first place.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the union had embarked on a nationwide warning strike to press home its members\u2019 demands beginning from Feb.14 .\n\nThe lecturers\u2019 demands include funding of the Revitalisation of Public Universities, Earned Academic Allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) and promotion arrears.\n\nOthers are: the renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FG Agreement and the inconsistency in Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS).\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "New twists, alleged cover-up trail death of Bamise",
          "text": "By Adebayo Obajemu\n\nConcerned and worried Nigerians have not let up in reacting to the gruesome killing of 22-year-old Oluwabamise Ayanola who was initially declared missing after boarding a Lagos Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, only for her lifeless body to be found at the Carter Bridge by the police before depositing it at morgue of the Mainland Hospital, Yaba, Lagos days later.\n\nThe deceased, said to be a fashion designer, allegedly boarded the BRT bus with number plate 240257 from Chevron bus stop at Lekki to Oshodi, at about 7p.m., heading to her elder brothers place at Idimu. But she never got to her destination and could not be reached on her phone until her remains were found.\n\nFleeing driver of the BRT bus, Andrew Nice was arrested in his hideout at Ososa, Ogun state by the Department of State Services, DSS. He was, thereafter, handed over to the police. He was arrested alongside a man that harboured him.\n\nMeanwhile, the alleged perpetrated was on Thursday accused by another lady of raping her last in the same bus after picking her up at night, and subsequently paid hush money for her silence.\n\nBusinessHallmark, who spoke with some residents of Isale Eko area, opposite Ilu Binrin Estate, where the decomposed body of Oluwabamise was dumped, said that when her body was discovered a day after the incident, some body parts were no longer found. This position is contrary to police claims that nothing was missing in her body.\n\nNice, the driver of Bus Rapid Transit vehicle allegedly made a startling confession in a video immediately done after his arrest that he did something dirty with Bamise suggesting that he had an unlawful canal knowledge of the young lady.\n\nShe forced herself out, she was crying for help. Because of the dirty act I have done, I was afraid, the driver said.\n\nThe driver had later in a seemly cooked up video released last Monday denied his involvement in Bamises murder \u2014 a statement which attracted the outrage of many Nigerians on social media. An online medium had first raised the alarm over different accounts and even the appearance of the suspect, stressing that something was amiss.\n\nWhen he was first arrested, the suspect looked dishevelled and unkempt, and confessed to the crime, only to later appear in the second video well dressed and denying his complicity. The victim had in her chat with a friend before losing contact hinted of the danger she was facing and the SUV car that tailed the bus on the journey. Her harvested organs may suggest that there was a conspiracy involving more than the suspect.\n\nAlso the indifference and alleged denial of the bus company to the initial allegations pointed to collusion, as they refused to assist the family identify the suspect, whose picture the victim had forwarded to her friend prior to her death.\n\nThe question that Nigerians are asking is: why did the Bus company say none of their buses was out at the time of the incident? And why the hastily cooked up video? Why has Lagos State government not sent representative to commiserate with the grieving family of the murdered lady?\n\nDuring the journey, the fashion designer was said to have observed that the driver was not picking up other passengers at subsequent bus stops along the route. Disturbed by the development, she allegedly sent a message and voice note to her friend telling her of predicament. It was the last time her friend and family members heard from her.\n\nLast Monday, she was found dead on Carter Bridge, according to the Lagos State Police Command.\n\nThe Lagos State Police Command regrets to inform the public that Oluwabamise Ayanwole, the 22-year-old lady who got missing in transit while on board a BRT bus on 26/2/2022 has been found dead, Adekunle Ajisebutu, Lagos police spokesperson, had said.\n\nThe corpse was found lying on the Carter Bridge by Ogogoro Community, Lagos Island. The corpse has been deposited at the morgue of the Mainland Hospital, Yaba, for an autopsy.\n\nSpeaking, the driver said he was accosted by some gunmen who forced him to stop around Carter Bridge and forcefully took the lady away.\n\nI picked her from Chevron and I picked the other three guys at Agbegi, when those guys showed me the weapon as I was driving, I couldnt be myself anymore. Fear came over me, so whatever they (the men with gun sitting beside me) asked me to do, I did, he had said.\n\nSo when I followed that Carter Bridge, that overhead bridge, they told me to stop there.\n\nWhen they ordered me to stop, they asked me to open the door, when I opened the door, then they started dragging her. I saw her crying for help but I was helpless. When the issue happened, I ran away because I was afraid, he had noted.\n\nThe driver\u2019s strange account of what happened has been criticized by Nigerians and the brother-in-law to the deceased, Engr. Johnson Omilana, who told a newspaper (not Business Hallmark) that the driver was lying. He is lying, all he said were lies. I am happy he ran away the first time because he knows the crime he committed. I believe he had no idea that the lady did some recordings and shared them with her friends while on the bus.\n\nMy surprise is, it was not quite long when we discovered her dead body that we had that the man was arrested and paraded. He confessed that he ran away because he was afraid. The question to ask is, why did\u2019nt he report the incident to the companys management and the police?\n\nWhen I asked the management of BRT if they had knowledge that any of their vehicles were on the road, they said no, all their vehicles were intact and in good condition. When I went there initially, I had only the recording, not the bus number; it was after a while that her senior brother advised I zoomed into the recording to get the bus number and I did and got the number 240257 which I showed to them and they told us to wait that the bus driver will soon arrive.\n\n\u201cSo, I asked some people to wait while I went to Akinpelu police station to make a statement. When I got back to the terminus, I was told to go to Ajah where she boarded the bus so that I can trace it from that place.\n\nSurprisingly, the driver showed up in the companys uniform. For me, justice must prevail because that driver is not telling the truth. Everyone knows that there is nothing hidden again. We have a lawyer on the ground on this case.\n\nMany Nigerians who spoke with BusinessHallmark on the matter accused the driver of lying about the circumstances that led to the death of the girl. They indicted the driver and accused him of complicity while others said he was yet to say the truth as regards what transpired.\n\nJoke Adeolu, a civil servant doubted the driver\u2019s account, saying he must have been carrying out such a beastly assignment for long.\n\nThis man and his evil colleagues have been doing this for long. I think they were just unfortunate this time that the poor girl made a video and dropped several voice notes before the driver carried his partners in crime.\n\nIf they were aware she left traces, I guess they would have let her go and looked for another victim. The driver went to park the bus, resumed work normally the following day, only to run away when the family members of the girl came to ask for her whereabouts. He was\u2019nt expecting anybody to have known. Its very likely he belongs to a ritualistic syndicate.\n\nIn her reaction, made to an online medium, Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham criticized the Lagos State government over the dastardly manner Bamise was killed.\n\n\u201cIt is sad enough that Nigeria is not safe but to think that a place or thing considered as government property like BRT is now considered a dangerous place should get all of us concerned. But I have a few questions for Lagos State Government, why are the BRT buses not fitted with CCTV cameras?\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat measure have you put in place since this incident that made you assure Lagosians that the BRT buses are now safe? Are we truly safe or your speech is just government rhetoric, telling us what we want to hear?\u201d\n\nShe advised Lagosians to be extra careful and observant while sending her condolence to the family of the deceased.\n\nLast Friday, a Yaba Chief Magistrates Court sitting in Lagos, ordered the remand of Andrew Nice Omininikoron, a BRT driver, in the Ikoyi Custodial Centre for the alleged murder and rape of a 22-year-old lady, Oluwabamise Ayanwola. Magistrate O.A. Salawu ordered that Mr. Omininikoron, 47, be remanded for 30 days.\n\nShe held that the accused was to be remanded pending legal advice from the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). According to reports, the defendant is charged with conspiracy, murder, rape and misconduct with regards to corpses.\n\nThe charge was read to the defendant but his plea was not taken by the court. The magistrate adjourned the case until April 11 for the DPPs advice.\n\nEarlier, the Officer in charge of the Legal Department at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) Panti, Yetunde Cardoso., said that Omininikoron committed the offence at 8 p.m. on February 26, along Ajah-Oshodi expressway, on a Lagos State BRT bus with code number 257. She said that Mr. Omininikoron, who was on duty as a driver, raped Ms Ayanwola and pushed her out of the moving BRT bus.\n\nThe offence, she said, contravened the provisions of sections 411, 223, 260 and 165 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). According to legal minds spoken to by Business Hallmark, Sections 223 stipulates the death penalty for the offence of murder, 260 provides for life imprisonment for rape and 165 carries five years imprisonment for misconduct with regards to corpses.\n\nThe Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwoolu was billed to visit the family to commiserate with them but it was later aborted, citing other engagements, a development criticized by some Nigerians as insensitivity. Though, the wife of the Governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has described Bamise\u2019s muder as sad, shocking, and devastating, many Nigerians said the first lady or her husband ought to have visited the bereaved family.\n\nAs mothers, we are devastated; we are in shock; we are not happy. Lagos State is not known for ritual killings and we will not tolerate such, Mrs. Sanwo-Olu was quoted to have said in a statement issued on Tuesday by the Assistant Director, Public Affairs, Office of the Lagos State First Lady, Olubukonla Nwonah.\n\nInvestigations are going on and I am sure there will be justice. Mr. Governor is not sleeping. There will certainly be justice, she assured.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nPalpable anxiety and uncertainty now pervade the proposed amendment of the pension Act 2014 as opposition by PenCom and other pension administrators continues to mount.\n\nStakeholders in the nations pension industry have fault the proposal for the payment of a lump sum of 75 per cent from the Retirement Savings Account(RSA) to retirees upon attainment of retirement age.\n\nThe bill currently before the House of Representatives is seeking, among other things, to increase the lump sum payable to retirees to at least 75 per cent of the amount in their RSA and to criminalise undue delay and other difficulties pensioners encounter in getting their money.\n\nThe Pension Reform Act 2004, which was repealed and replaced with the Pension Reform Act 2014, established a mandatory Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) for workers in both the public and private sectors.\n\nSection 4 of Pension Reform Act 2014, provides for a mandatory minimum contribution of ten and eight percent of employees monthly emolument by the employer and employee respectively.\n\nEach employee is to open a Retirement Savings Account (RSA) into which the contributions are to be paid, with a Pension Fund Administrator (PFA) licensed by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) established under section 17 of the Act, to regulate and supervise pension schemes in the country.\n\nThe PFA is to manage and invest the fund in the RSA, from where a contributor will draw benefits on retirement, in line with the provisions of the Act. The Act currently empowers the PenCom and the funds administrators to pay 25 per cent lump sum to retirees before calculating the amount to pay them on monthly basis as pension, from the remaining 75 per cent.\n\nThe Director-General of PenCom, Hajia Aisha Dahir-Umar, recently revealed that Nigeria has a pension industry that has accumulated pension assets in excess of N13 trillion invested in various aspects of the nations economy.\n\nThe Senate had in consideration of the bill seeking to bring respite to distressed Nigerian retirees, tagged Pension Reform Act 2014 (Amendment), 2022, which passed second reading last month, proposed the payment of 75 per cent to retirees as lump sum.\n\nMisery and pain\n\nThe sponsor of the bill, Senator Aliyu Wamakko (Sokoto North), had stated that the bill sought to amend the Pension Reform Act 2014, to provide for a definite and reasonable percentage a retiree can withdraw from his/her retirement savings accounts.\n\nThe lawmaker regretted that despite the amendments of the Pension Reform Act 2004 as Pension Reform Act 2014, which provides for a departure from the old pension scheme of Defined Benefits, the legislation has failed to achieve its objective of solving the intractable pension crisis in the country.\n\nSuffice to say that the issue of pension in Nigeria has more or less turned to a monster that has defied all efforts by successive governments to contain it.\n\nIn view of the retirees protracted sufferings and pains who are equally Nigerians, continued search for a lasting panacea is a duty bound upon us and all others concerned.\n\nWamakko explained that the Act in Section 7(1)(a) was amended in the bill to allow retirees withdraw 75 percent of their benefits. He bemoaned the situation where pension administrators in the country benefit at the expense of Nigerian pensioners who continue to suffer neglect.\n\nThese Nigerians who had retired from service after several years serving the nation are finding it extremely difficult to be the owners of their pension savings in this new arrangement.\n\nSo, unless that law is made categorically clear that they can withdraw the 75 per cent which we are proposing in this amendment, then they can definitely have some relief as retirees.\n\nHe said, Of what significance are all these huge assets and sums of money to the owners, the Nigerian pensioners who are dying daily of hunger, disease, and deprivation. I believe this is cruel and unjustifiably inhuman.\n\nSo let the Nigerian pensioners feel the impact of the assets in the savings they have generated. But the true situation is that only the pension administrators are benefitting while the owners continue to suffer total neglect.\n\nDetrimental to retirees and economy\n\nBut the Pension Funds Operators Association of Nigeria (PenOp) has warned that the bill seeking 75 per cent lump sum for retirees under the CPS will have a negative effect on not on the pensioners but also the active contributors if allowed to stay.\n\nIn a presentation, PenOp said The proposal to increase lump sum payments to 75 per cent, while it may seem popular and laudable, it actually negatively affects both the retiree and the active contributors.\n\nAccording to the operators, studies have shown that when people who are not used to receiving huge sums are given a large amount of money, they usually spend it on consumptive rather than productive activities.\n\nWhat would happen when large payouts are given to retirees is that they would not have any other fall back and ultimately, they may become a liability on the society, PenOp said.\n\nWhile explaining that it is what the worker saves plus investment returns that form the pension balance, it said, If we are advocating for a larger lump sum payment of at least 75 per cent as is proposed under this bill, then we need to ask if the 25 per cent remaining is enough to sustain you on a periodic basis for the rest of your time on earth. The answer is a resounding no.\n\nExplaining the need for workers to join the CPS early, it said if the employer and employee contribute consistently over a long period of time, the funds in the individuals RSA will be sufficient to have a decent lump sum with enough funds remaining to earn a decent pension for life.\n\nPenOp said, As a matter of fact, what we need to promote, is to encourage more workers to add to their statutory deductions while working, as this would enable them to shore up their balances over time.\n\nWhat we need to advocate more is the consistency and discipline in the contributions that will even remove the need for any large lump sum payout when retired.\n\nAt a recent public hearing organised by the House Committee on Pension, the PenCom DG said the amendment, if approved, would be contrary to the provision of Section173 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), which guarantees the right to pensions for all public officers as the payment of at least 75 per cent of the balance of the RSA as lump sum at retirement.\n\nAccording to her, this will significantly deplete the pension savings such that the contributions will not be sufficient to provide meaningful pensions during retirement.\n\nThis converts the pensions into a provident fund and leaves such a retiree with no periodic pensions, which is contrary to the requirement of Section 173 of the 1999 Constitution, she said.\n\nAlso speaking on the bill, the Managing Director, IEI Anchor Pensions Managers, Mr. Glory Etaduovie described the the upfront payment is illusory and distractive, pointing out that a nation that saves and invests well grows, which is one of the objectives of pension.\n\nEtaduovie, who said pension boosts infrastructure investment and development, stressed that it bridges critical development gaps.\n\nIt is a buoy for the capital market, stimulating growth in the economy and the employment. This fund must be jealously protected. The ratio of pension assets to the Nigerian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was just eight per cent as at end of 2020.

          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nFor airlines, these are not the best of times as prices of diesels have gone up astronomically, in turn spurning an unprecedented skyrocketing in airfares, making many Nigerians to be caught in catch 22 situation. For a long time road transportation has not been safe as a result of growing insecurity on our high ways coupled with poor state of roads in the country.\n\nThe development which has affected many businesses, including, hotels, hospitals, and manufacturing companies, may not be far from rallying oil prices in the international market as a result of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. The price of crude oil has spiked from about $70 per barrel in January to almost $120,\n\nwhich has led to higher diesel prices locally, taking diesel price to N650 a litre and Jet A-1 fuel or aviation fuel to over N700 per litre from N220 in January.\n\nDr. Amos Adesiyun, an oil and gas expert told BusinessHallmark that \u201d part of the challenge is that generated power supply has proved insufficient for local demand.\u201d\n\nNigerians across board, including federal law makers are piqued, and have criticised the sudden spike in the prices of airlines tickets as most domestic airlines pegged their minimum fare at N50,000. Before the development, the economy class fares bordered between N23,300 and N48,000, although fare itched up to N70,000 during the last festive season.\n\nIn the past weeks, the prices of air tickets of major companies, such as Airpeace, Ibom Air, Max Air, Aero contractors, Dana, Azman air among others, rose to a maximum of N50,000. Strangely enough, passengers may no longer receive discounts even if they book weeks ahead as it used to happen.\n\nThe minimum ticket price for even a three-week booking on Air Peace, Ibom air, Max Air, Azman air and others has been pegged at N50,000 flat rate, about 115 per cent increase from N23,300 minimum rate. Air travel in the country has witnessed increased patronage in recent years with rising insecurity that has seen many roads taken over by kidnappers.\n\nHigh road transport fares have also pushed more people to take to the skies, resulting in part to poor services as airlines struggle to meet demand.\n\nLast week, the Airline Operators of Nigeria in a statement condemned attacks on airline staff and facilities by passengers at the various airports over flight delays or cancellations.\n\nThe association also fumed over the high cost of jet fuel, foreign exchange scarcity, inflation, increase in ground handling charges as well as cost of buying and importation of spare parts.\n\nThey said aviation fuel has risen from N190 per litre to N410 in Lagos, N422 in Abuja and Port Harcourt, and N429 in Kano. The price is now almost N70.\n\nDr.Olufemi Omoyele, director of Entrepreneurship at Redeemers University said he had planned to travel by air to Port Harcourt, but was surprised when he was confronted with N50,000 as air ticket.\n\n\u201cMy brother, how many Nigerians can afford this at this period, yet going by road is like a jump in the dark because of growing Insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Committee on Upstream and Midstream have met with the Group managing director of NNPC on the rising price of diesel and its collateral damage which has led to rising airlines fares, and other economic distress.\n\nAlso feeling the pressure being mounted on NNPC, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, Thursday assured Nigerians that the company would work with relevant authorities to ensure that the present crisis in the aviation sector was resolved.\n\nThat was as Director General of Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Capt. Musa Shuaibu Nuhu, warned that the aviation industry might soon be shutdown, saying with the current jet fuel scarcity, it is not safe to fly anymore. Kyari gave the assurance while addressing the leadership of the House of Representatives, who were investigating the sudden scarcity and high cost of aviation fuel.\n\nAt the meeting well attended by members of the House Committees on Petroleum Downstream and Upstream, Jet-A1 marketers, and airline operators, the NNPC GMD regretted the late intervention, saying all the supply data showed there was sufficient Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) in the country.\n\nGiven the current situation, Kyari advised airline operators to have the right commercial arrangement with their support petroleum products, particularly ATK.\n\nKyari said, Why we didnt act was that all the supply data we have showed sufficient ATK in the country. This means that it may be in the wrong hands. Theres frenzy in the market today, no one knows what the price will be tomorrow.\n\nThats still not an excuse for escalation of prices, we will work with the relevant authority to ensure that if theres any such thing, we will deal with it jointly as an industry. We will work together to ensure that this is resolved.\n\nAddressing the demand by airline operators and lawmakers that the fuel price should be reduced to at least N200 per litre, Kyari said it was not feasible, as they had no control over it. He said the price was determined internationally price.\n\nIts impossible; today the landing cost of ATK is N480, the price, we have no control on that.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns raised by the lawmakers regarding the crisis in the energy sector, despite the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NNPC GMD said PIA passage was not a mistake. He said the company would work with other stakeholders to ensure gaps in the sector are closed.\n\nWhenever theres supply gap it is our role to ensure that supply gap is closed, we will work with the authority and other stakeholders to ensure that if theres any gap thats existing we fill it, Kyari added.\n\nIn his presentation, Director General, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Musa Shuaibu Nuhu, warned that they might shutdown aviation industry soon as its not safe to fly anymore.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks we have seen a significant rise in the cost of aviation fuel. One year ago it was selling at N190 per litre and as of this afternoon it has gone for N670 per litre, what this has done is that it has increased the cost of operations.\n\nThis is a significant safety concern to us, if airlines cannot have enough financial margin to comply with all the mandatory requirement then we really have to look at, God forbid I dont want to come before this committee to explain why something happened.\n\nEvery day it increases. I wont be surprised tomorrow if it sells for N700 per litre. Considering the ticket price now, the airline industry cannot survive. The option is we shutdown, because they cannot generate enough revenues to operate safely.\n\nEarlier, Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, who spoke on behalf of the airline operators appealed to NNPC to ensure that in the coming days, the price of aviation fuel dropped to N200 per litre.\n\nThats the only time we will be able to operate safely and ensure some running of the schedule operations in this country. I dont know how they will do it but they should, it will be good because even at N200 its a lot for the airlines. Not N400 or any other higher price, as we are talking now it will soon hit N700 and possibly N1,000.\n\nWhat happened in the last two weeks is alarming. From a price of N190 per litre two weeks ago, the price is now N670 as at today and we dont know what it is going to happen.\n\nThe government has done so much for us in this industry with the president granting us waivers. We held a meeting and decided to shut down our operations because of the cost of operation. We are owing so much money and we dont want AMCON to come after us.\n\nOnyema added, We cannot survive like this for another three days. We had to reduce our operations to 30 per cent because the product is not even available. So, I am surprised that the Executive Director said they have supplies to last 34 days. We are making so much sacrifice here.\n\nI am evacuating Nigerians from Poland and I had to pay three times the usual amount and I am not asking for a refund. So, something needs to be done and done fast.\n\nOn his part, Executive Director, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Ogbugo Ukoha, noted the role of the agency in regulating the industry, and issuing licenses to importers of the product. Ukoha said from his records, there was enough aviation fuel to last the country for 34 days. He also said that aviation fuel was one of the petroleum products that had been fully deregulated and was, therefore, controlled by market forces, adding that the authority has issued licenses to about 28 companies to import the product into the country.\n\nBut his explanation did not go down well with Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, and other lawmakers.\n\nWase questioned why there should be scarcity of the product if there was enough supply to last for 34 days, alleging that there must be a cartel working hard to sabotage the efforts of the government.\n\nAlready, the near-term inflation outlook appears increasingly unpredictable, as the petrol shortage crisis and the rising cost of diesel have added to other challenges driving up prices of essential commodities in the country.\n\nDr. Omoyele said inflation may go up again, \u201cas it is expected to be triggered by the shortage of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), as the cost of transportation, a key driver of inflation, has doubled or tripled in different cities.\u201d\n\nFor manufacturers, the impact will be felt in rising production costs with worries about the knock-on effect on sales as consumers incomes weaken further. For the real estate sector, many estates are subscribing to distribution companies higher tariff plans in exchange for improved access to electricity, as a way to manage rising costs of operating diesel plants.\n\nAccording to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), the rising cost of production has made its members consider the renewable energy alternative offered through the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Energy Finance (SUNREF), a green financing line for businesses developed by the French Development Agency (AFD).\n\nAlready, MAN and AFD have put together an $81m funding scheme for the development of renewable energy and the energy efficiency sector in Nigeria.\n\nLast year, MAN noted that it spent 33 per cent more to generate electricity; a move considered too expensive and responsible for the non-competitiveness of locally produced goods. For many residents, insufficient power supply has made many Nigerians depend mainly on petrol and diesel for power generation.\n\nSince February, most parts of the country have been experiencing poor power supply \u2014 worse than it used to be. President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Michael Olawale-Cole, said the escalation in the price of diesel would be a double jeopardy for manufacturers and portends a hard time that could even threaten their survival and competitiveness.\n\nOlawale-Cole said that the prevailing prices of diesel, as well as current petrol scarcity are totally unacceptable, warning, if we are not careful the economy and Nigerians will suffer for it.\n\nMany hospitals have had to ration their diesels causing disruptions. This has in turn affected treatment charges.\n\nDr. \u1eccm\u1ecdniyi Abegunde, a consultant gynaecologist told BusinessHallmark that \u201chere at St.Louis Hospital, we have reviewed our charges in consonant with the high cost of maintaining infrastructure and keeping the work going. Diesels price has gone up ,and we have to put on light 24 /7. Our patients , we have made them to understand our conditions.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Sunday expressed his administration\u2019s readiness to set up a tripartite committee that would review the existing Chiefs Law of the State.\n\nThe Committee, according to the Governor, would involve a representative each from the members of the State Executive Council, Legislature and Traditional Council, with a mandate to painstakingly review, analyse critically and meticulously, the palpable grey areas in the said Law.\n\nThis is even as the Governor reaffirmed his Administration\u2019s commitment to further strengthening the traditional institution to enhance its capacity for effective and efficient service delivery to the people of the State.\n\nReceiving the proposed letter written by members of the State Traditional Council of Obas, aimed at effecting the review of the State Chiefs Law, at Government House, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola expressed delight at the move made by the monarchs to review the Chiefs Law, saying the initiative would go a long way to permanently find a possible and lasting solution to some of the challenges attributed to kingship and chieftaincy in the State.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, who described the gesture as a welcome development, assured that the tripartite Committee would be constituted in the next few days to swing into action.\n\nHe said the Committee when constituted would come up with suggestions and proffer workable solutions to some of the identified challenges in the existing Law, thus helping to ensure possible amendments that would suit the collective interest of the people of the State.\n\n\u201cI commend our traditional rulers on this visit. I thank you for your unflinching support, most importantly your continued show of love before, during and after the last primary election of our party. Your prayers when we visited you at your various palaces before the primary can never be forgotten as this manifested in the success we recorded at the party\u2019s primary election.\n\n\u201cAs to the Chiefs Law of our dear State, we will be very happy if that is reviewed. I am very happy that you are looking into it already. This is a welcome development.\n\n\u201cWe know most of these laws are obsolete and we welcome the idea of the tripartite Committee that you have come up with. It is our hope that this would further strengthen the traditional institution which has been our vision as a government.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in the fact that the existing Law has its own challenges and this has been causing a lot of crisis as to enthronement of monarchs among other chieftaincy-related matters.\n\n\u201cSo, to further demonstrate our commitment to ensuring a vibrant and viable traditional institution, we will set up the committee to look into it. I commend you for your efforts at keeping your domains safe.\n\n\u201cWe understand the little crisis in some towns, but we hope with this move and with the support from Federal Government, it will be a thing of the past. We appreciate your continued support to ensure security and adequate protection of lives and property of your subjects in your respective domains\u201d, Oyetola added.\n\nPresesenting the letter on behalf of the Chairman of Osun Council of Obas, Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Ayotunde Olabomi, said the call to review the State Chiefs Law was arrived at having painstakingly assessed and evaluated the grey areas of the existing Law.\n\nOba Olabomi who is the leader of the Committee on State Chiefs Law set up by the members of the Traditional Council of Obas, said the review of the Law would help to innovatively reposition the traditional institution in the State.\n\nThe Aragbiji of Iragbiji said the Chairman of the Council and Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, was pleased with the decision of the Committee to get the Law reviewed.\n\nHe commended the Governor for according due respect to traditional rulers in the State, noting that his good gesture and kind-heartedness had endeared him more to the people of the State in general and traditional rulers in particular.\n\n\u201cSequel to the decision reached at the State Council of Obas meeting that the Chiefs Law of the State should be reviewed and necessary amendments made, the Committee set up by the Council recommended as follows:\n\n\u201cThat the review of the Law cannot be done in isolation; that the Council would need the collaboiration of both the Executive and Legislative arms of Government.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Council decided to seek Your Excellency\u2019s approval for the setting up of a Tripartite Committee that would comprise the following representatives: Executive arm of Government; State House of Assembly and Council of Obas\u2019 Committee on the Review of the Chiefs Law.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to commend and appreciate Your Excellency for the respect and honour with which Your Excellency has been handling the Traditional Institution in the State. God Almighty shall continue to guide you right in all your endeavors.\n\n\u201cIt is the belief of the Council members that Your Excellency would also see reason for the review of the Chiefs Law which is to make the institution more dignifying\u201d, the letter reads in parts.\n\nSome of the traditional rulers in attendance are Owaloko of Iloko-Ijesa, Oba Hakeem Ogungbangbe; Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Adedokun Abolarinwa; Alapomu of Apomu, Oba Kayode Adenekan Afolabi; Salu of Edunabon, Oba Adesoji Kehinde Oladepo; and Olusongbe of Songbe, Oba Kamil Ajadi.",

          "text": "2023: Tambuwal\u2019s Consultations In Northwest Successful\n\nThe consultations by the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, in the North West geo-political zone towards gauging whether or not to aspire to the highest office in the land in 2023 has ended on a successful note.\n\nThe effort which spanned weeks between February and early March 2022 was based on what most people in Sokoto State and, indeed, Nigeria knew and believed about the governor \u2013 his sterling records as Speaker of the House of Representatives, governor of Sokoto State and chairman of Peoples Democratic Party Governors Forum. The exemplary leadership qualities displayed in these offices had lent momentum to a growing clamour for Tambuwal to vie for president.\n\nBefore embarking on the tours to states in the zone \u2013 Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Zamfara and Kaduna, the Sokoto PDP stakeholders had endorsed him to run for president in the next general election. Their central message was that Sokoto State and, certainly, Nigeria could not afford to lose or ignore a winning player in the selection of contestants for the critical political of the president of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\nTambuwal hearkened to the calls and thus embarked on a nationwide consultation to try to figure out how to approach the issue. \u201cI have listened to our party leaders, women, and youths on the call that I should initiate and begin the process of consultation with a view to running and contesting for the president of Nigeria under the banner of our great party,\u201d he told the stakeholders during the meeting held at the PDP state secretariat in Sokoto on January 31, 2022.\n\nThe lawyer and graduate of Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto, began the first leg of the nationwide consultation on February 1 with a visit to Jigawa where he met with former Governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, at his home in Birnin Kudu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nTambuwal was accompanied on the visit by former Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa; Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Gusau; former Deputy Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Mukhtar Shagari; former Minister of Power, Engr. Bello Suleiman; and former chairman of PDP, Alhaji Bello Muhammad.\n\nOthers included former Director, Counterterrorism, in the office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), Gen Sarkin-Yaki Bello, and Hon. Aminu Koko.\n\nTambuwal\u2019s entourage was welcomed at Dutse International Airport by a large and joyous crowd led by Mustapha Sule Lamido, son of their host. The Governor\u2019s motorcade rode at a snail speed for about two hours in a journey that should take less than thirty minutes to Bamaina, Lamido\u2019s town.\n\nIn Bamaina, former Governor Lamido said Tambuwal possessed the track record and national outlook needed to overcome Nigeria\u2019s current challenges, which had been worsened by a worrisome spate of ethnicity and religious division under President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s All Progressives Congress, APC, government.\n\n\u201cOur son here is like me. We have similar and parallel positions in government,\u201d he said of Tambuwal.\n\nLamido said he looked forward to seeing Tambuwal on the country\u2019s highest political seat, emphasizing that he is eminently qualified to run for the highest office in the land.\n\nHe described Tambuwal as a \u201cpan Nigerian that will be just,\u201d and that Nigerians need him to put the country back on the path of peace, progress, and harmony.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe can reach out to all Nigerians across the geographic and other divides in our bid to support him.\n\n\u201cThis does not suggest that we are beggars hungry for power. Instead, we are worthy stakeholders with friends in many parts of the country who we can persuade to see reason with us in the realisation of the Nigerian project.\u201d\n\nFormer Governor Bafarawa thanked Lamido for receiving Tambuwal and his entourage. \u201cYou are not just a former governor but a great political mobiliser whose people still respect and follow, despite the fact that you have been out of office for almost seven years now,\u201d he said.\n\nA week after, Tambuwal and his entourage were in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, and was to a rousing welcome by Zamfara State Deputy Governor, Mahdi Aliyu Gasau, as well as the state PDP leader, including the state chairman.\n\nIn his speech, Tambuwal sympathized with the people of the state over the insecurity that had claimed many lives, and stressed that it was imperative for leaders of PDP in the state to close ranks so as to take over Nigeria and Zamfara State in the 2023 general election, saying that the rollback of the fortunes of the PDP in leading Nigeria and Zamfara State will soon be over.\n\nHis words: \u201cIf we succeed in our bid, the country will witness a reversal of the current bad fortunes.\u201d\n\nDeputy Governor Gusau, in his remarks, said he was solidly behind Governor Tambuwal\u2019s Presidential ambition and urged him to carry the entire Zamfara PDP along in his quest to become Nigeria\u2019s President next year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no turning in our determination to back him all the way,\u201d Gusau said, while listing the sterling political credentials of Tambuwal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next day, Tambuwal\u2019s consultative train moved to Kebbi State. The entourage was accorded rousing welcome by the Kebbi State PDP leaders and members, including the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Ibrahim Abdullahi; former Minister for Special Duties, Alhaji Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (SAN); former Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Ishaya Rinzi Bamaiyi (rtd); former Director of Counterterrorism in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), Gen. Sarkin-Yaki Bello; former General Officer Commanding 8 Division, Sokoto, Gen. Aminu Bande; and former National Women Leader of the PDP, Hajiya Maryam Waziri.\n\nWelcoming Tambuwal, former acting National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Bello Halliru Muhammad, said Nigeria needs a competent, trustworthy and courageous leader, like Tambuwal.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria is in bad shape after years of (misrule) by President Muhammadu Buhari. The country has never been so divided along ethnic and religious affiliations like now. If a worthy person doesn\u2019t take over (Nigeria) risks breaking apart.\u201d\n\nThe Kebbi State PDP Chairman, Alhaji Bello Usman Suru, in his own remarks, gave an unequivocal endorsement of Tambuwal for President and pledged the unalloyed support of Kebbi PDP. Suru said: \u201cHistorically, we in Kebbi are one with the people of Sokoto. You don\u2019t need to campaign here. All the state delegates, chairmen of local government wings and members of the executives in the state will vote for you.\n\n\u201cWhen it is time to decide who becomes our party\u2019s Presidential candidate, we may exceed even Sokoto state. I say this because there may be some black legs in Sokoto, but here we are behind you one hundred per cent.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Tambuwal said: \u201cThe PDP in Kebbi state is united. The PDP in Kebbi state is compact and strong. I appeal to you to work together as a family to attract more members from the opposition because there is a lot of trouble in the other house.\n\n\u201cI know they will leave and come here. When they come, I implore you to be very magnanimous so that when they come, you should be accommodating and carry everybody along, so that together, God willing, we shall win the elections here in Kebbi State and in Nigeria come 2023.\u201d\n\nTambuwal also spoke on the state of the nation, lamenting \u201cNigeria was on the verge of collapse as a result of insecurity, debilitating healthcare system, poverty, falling standard of education, corruption and other ills that have become the hallmark of the APC administration thus far.\u201d\n\nWhen the train got to Katsina, Tambuwal and his team met PDP leaders and stakeholders and pleaded for unity among party members, adding that it would be easier to reclaim power from the ruling APC with a united front.\n\nWhile pledging an all-inclusive government that will bring back hope to Nigerians if elected President, Tambuwal said Nigeria had \u201cnever been this divided with several agitations and insecurity at a very alarming level.\u201d\n\nHe therefore said reclaiming \u201cpower from the APC is a must to save the nation from the current decay.\u201d\n\nThe team also had a whistle-stop in Kaduna, where Tambuwal visited former Governor Ahmed Makarfi. Here, the presidential hopeful emphasized the need for unity in the party as a precondition for reclaiming power from the APC.\n\nHe, however, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to follow the footsteps of former President Goodluck Jonathan by bequeathing free, fair and credible election on the nation in 2023.\n\nHe also counseled the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to conduct free, fair and credible elections and thus leave a lasting legacy for himself. He said: \u201cAs I said before, the head of the electoral umpire \u2013 the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof Mahmood Yakubu has only one option. That option is to leave a lasting legacy. From my knowledge, he is from a very good family background.\n\n\u201cSo, he needs to actually make sure that he did not soil that his family history and his own personal history by ensuring he conduct a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nA party stalwart said the impressive retinue of leaders and supporters that accompanied Tambuwal and those that received him in the states in the North West geo-political zone he traversed has demonstrated the quality of endorsement he has secured at home so far and hopes this will translate into a broader national appeal.",

The suspect who hails from Edo state but lives in Italy claimed ownership of the recovered psychotropic substances.\n\n\u201cAlso on the same day, operatives arrested a freight agent, Rafiu Abbas at the NAHCO Export Shed of the airport when he presented a cargo containing 19.15kg cannabis going to London. The illicit substance was concealed inside plastic containers labelled as \u201cAfrican Dishes\u201d and packed in a bag.\n\n\u201cIn a related development, a 63-year-old Vincent Obimma was on Friday 11th March arrested with 350grams of cocaine and 150grams of heroin by NDLEA operatives at a park in the Apapa seaport corridor in Lagos. The drugs were hidden in industrial torch packets heading to Kano, Kano state.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, a drug dealer in Kaduna state, James Okenwa, has been arrested in a follow-up operation at Central Market, Kaduna. He admitted the ownership of 1,807 bottles of cough syrup with codeine that were earlier recovered from two suspects at tollgate. At the point of his arrest, another 152 bottles of the drug were recovered from his vehicle. He has accepted ownership of all the 1,959 bottles of codeine syrup,\u201d the statement added.",

It hinged its decision on the unseriousness of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cNEC, having taken reports on the engagements of the Trustees and Principal Officers with the Government, concluded that Government had failed to satisfactorily address all the issues raised in the 2020 FGN/ASUU Memorandum of Action (MoA) within the four-week roll\u2014over strike period and resolved that the strike be rolled over for another eight (8) weeks to give Government more time to address all the issues in concrete terms so that our students will resume as soon as possible,\u201d a statement by ASUU\u2019s president, Emmanuel Osodeke, read.\n\n\u201cThe roll-over strike shall commence by 12.01 am on Monday, 14 March 2022.\u201d\n\nASUU blamed its decision on the insincerity of the government since it started the warning strike a month ago.

But ASUU dismissed the claims, saying the government was not fair in its evaluation.\n\nIrked by the development, students protested across the nation and called for a reopening of campuses.\n\nA meeting between officials of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and the Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, ended with the minister walking out on them.\n\nWhile the ASUU strike lingers, members of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), are also threatening to down tools over agreements reached with the union.",

These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate,\u201d the President warned.\n\n\u201dAs the country prepares for the long run up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the APC started out with a confidence of victory and the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\nThis alone, addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\nThe party, he went on to note, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition Governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\nWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\nIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No-one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\nOf course the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.",

          "title": "INEC letter: Bello's CECPC makes u-turn, says Buni still in charge -",
          "text": "The Governor Abdullahi Sani Bello-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has made a U-Turn moments after a leaked letter from the Independent National Electoral Commission had subtly rejected the invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\nThe Bello-led CECPC had on Wednesday, 8 March written to the electoral body inviting it to the emergency NEC meeting of the party. The INEC in its reply stated clearly that the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC, runs contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2014).\n\nAddressing the media at the Buhari House National Secretariat of the party on Friday in Abuja, the Spokesman of the CECPC, Ismaeel Ahmed, said, \u201cSomebody asked, what is the position of Governor Mai Mala Buni in the party, I think it\u2019s pretty simple. I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated process for a lot of people not to understand. Since the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of all as the Chairman.\n\n\u201cIt has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case. Now, we have a Convention on March 26. The chairman wrote a letter and transmitted power to Governor Bello to enable him go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency, that cannot wait for Convention. We have a Convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other, whichever, he has transmitted a letter and Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. Why is it so difficult for people to understand that? Why is it so difficult for people to simply understand? I cannot understand why people are making this allegation.\n\n\u201cSo, Governor Sani Bello is acting the full authority of the Caretaker Committee and with the full authority of the stakeholders and with the full consent of Governor Mai Mala Buni. It is very clear and simple. If anybody has issues with any of our decisions, he can head to court. For now, we are doing it with the full backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity on this, absolutely none.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Senator John James Akpanudodehe, what is the position because I spelt others out the other members of the committee, but I didn\u2019t say anything about other people as well, we just talked about members of the committee. I didn\u2019t talk about their positions, whether secretary or chairman, since they have their responsibilities spelt out for them.\n\n\u201cThe other members are the ones told to come back to handle specific departments and that is what we are doing. At the full course of time, once all these are over, I will be able to brief you. But for now, these are the responsibilities of every member.\n\n\u201cAs part of efforts towards the hitch-free conduct of the March 26th National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) stepped up preparations this week.\n\n\u201cConvened a meeting chaired by the Acting Chairman and Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello, where strategies were adopted to fast-track the process towards conducting a National Convention;\n\n\u201c35 State chairmen of the APC and that of the FCT were sworn-in and mandated to work towards ensuring unity and harmony in their states. They were also charged to mobilise the members and the people to enable the party win future elections;\n\n\u201cReceived and deliberated on the report of the Committee on zoning. After exhaustively deliberating on the report, it was approved and the zoning formula was made public. The zoning formula was well-received by members of the party and all Nigerians;\n\n\u201cAssigned schedules of specific responsibilities to each members of the Caretaker Committee aligned to the existing Directorates at the Party\u2019s headquarters. The purpose is to ensure speedy execution of the various activities leading to the National Convention on March 26, 2022. The exercise has the additional benefit of ensuring synergy between the leadership of the party and the Directorates.\n\n\u201cDeliberated on and disagreed with the Federal High Court in its judgement on the status of the Governor of Ebonyi state over his sound decision to leave the PDP and join the APC along with the majority of members of the State House Assembly; CECPC regards the judgement as a travesty of justice and stand with the Governor and Ebonyi state legislators on appealing to a higher court;\n\n\u201cStreamlined and expanded the leadership of the various sub committees for the conduct of National Convention by bringing in more Governors and Ministers of the Federal Republic to spearhead the process. This has obviously fostered and deepened sense of belonging, inclusiveness and reflect the mosaic nature of the membership of the party;\n\n\u201cReviewed and strengthened the membership of the National Convention Subcommittees by making them compact and lighter. The subcommittees earlier composed were unnecessarily unwieldy and comprised excessive number of members, a situation that can reduce their efficiency;\n\n\u201cThe CECPC committee chaired by His Excellency the Governor of Niger State has issued a notice for a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party on March 17, 2022. As usual, a number of important issues will be discussed at the meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to questions from journalists, Ismaeel Ahmed disclosed that the previously scheduled Zonal Congresses will now be part of the National Convention. He assured that the March 26th National Convention was on course and sacrosanct.",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Moves to Retain Buni as Interim Chairman, Bello as Acting Chair",
          "text": "In a dramatic turn of events, leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may have agreed to keep Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as Interim Chairman of the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), while Niger State Governor Sani Bello functions as de facto chairman, though in acting capacity while Buni remains away.\n\nBuni had travelled for medical reasons and transmitted power to Bello in writing to act as the CECPC chairman. It was gathered on Sunday that the party is maintaining the letter of transition remains in force even as Buni remains interim caretaker chairman.\n\nHowever, it is not clear what they would ultimately do with Buni, as there is a move by some party stakeholders to have him impeached. Also, the fate of the CECPC Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe remains uncertain in all the permutations and intrigues playing out.\n\nJust last weekend, as part of intense lobby going on in the ruling party, former leaders of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) stormed London, where President Muhammadu Buhari is currently undergoing routine medical check-up, to persuade him to give more room to members of CPC,, one of the legacy parties that merged to form the APC before the 2015 general election, claiming they have been thoroughly marginalised in the scheme of things.\n\nInterestingly, according to observers \u201ccentral London Mosque, was overtaken by Nigerians, including ministers, governors, and many high net worth people, during Friday jumat prayers. As politicians have flown to London to lobby the President ahead of 2023 elections..\u201d\n\nUnder the new arrangement, Buni officially remains the interim CECPC chair as he was never legally removed in the first place, and since he transmitted a letter to Bello to act in his absence, that automatically confers his powers on Bello. And Bello would continue in his acting role which by implication means he would be carrying out the day to day running of the party. Meanwhile some of Buni\u2019s supporters believe he may return to the country this week while others want him to remain abroad until after the convention.\n\nThe Party\u2019s National Convention slated for March 26, THISDAY learnt will hold as planned.\n\nReliable sources in the presidency disclosed these yesterday, stressing that only a properly constituted National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party can remove the Buni-led CECPC.\n\nBello had announced a few days ago that he had taken over affairs at the APC national headquarters, disclosing that he was acting as Chairman in the absence of Buni.\n\nHe has called a NEC a meeting which INEC said was out of order because the letter was not signed by Chairman Buni and the Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn the turn of event the President\u2019s Legal Adviser may have appealed to him to allow Buni remain as interim chair while Bello continues as acting chairman.\n\nAccording to one of the sources, some of the president\u2019s associates noted that by the framework of the Party\u2019s NEC, Buni was never removed as CECPC chairman. \u201cYou cannot even be talking of return, when he was never removed, in the first place,\u201d a presidency source said.\n\nThe alleged removal of Buni had unsettled the party, causing division among APC governors and top stakeholders, with some alleging that the Yobe State governor was plotting to scuttle the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nWhile some expressed satisfaction with the development, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejected a letter inviting it to an emergency meeting of the party\u2019s NEC, where Bello\u2019s chairmanship was to be ratified.\n\nWhat has become apparent is that majority of the governors, in their bid to oust Buni by all means, failed to reckon with INEC. They thought they had succeeded, well, almost, and they had started to celebrate victory, until INEC threw a spanner in the works.\n\nThe commission\u2019s position, among other issues, led some from Buhari\u2019s inner circle of advisers to meet with him at the weekend.\n\nShedding light on the outcome of the meeting with the president, a source pointed out that Buhari informed those in attendance that his desire was to see that the convention was held as planned. Buhari also wanted to see a smooth, democratic and popular contest that would lead to the birth of a brand new National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, the source said.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe president was persuaded that there was a process that needed to be followed to remove the Buni-led CECPC. The NEC of the party is the highest administrative organ of the party, which takes very important decisions in terms of removal and appointment of the party leadership. Buni was not appointed by an imperial authority with the power remove him.\n\n\u201cSince the decision to appoint him was taken by NEC, it is only NEC that can remove him. So, Buni was never removed, in the first place. Certainly, if he personally withdraws, resigns or a NEC meeting takes place to remove him, then we can be talking about having a new CECPC chairman.\n\n\u201cNone of that has taken place; so the idea of removal does not arise. However, the party may come up with an arrangement to allow for certain processes to take place, particularly relating to conventions.\n\n\u201cBut Buni may decide to take the back seat to allow the convention process to take place, if he does that, then fine. However, the idea of concluding that he has been removed does not arise.\u201d\n\nBuni was blamed for withholding information from Party leaders about a court injunction stopping the party from going ahead with the convention. The Party has since set machinery in motion to have the injunction vacated this week to enable the convention hold.\n\nA faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate so. Apparently miffed by the what he was told, the president was said to have immediately directed that Buni be removed and replaced. Buni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself.\n\nAnother source at the meeting explained that Buhari was convinced of the need to allow Buni to to continue as interim chairman which the president was said to have accepted to save the party from danger.\n\nThe source also revealed that another contentious issue that was discussed was the president\u2019s purported endorsement of former Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Adamu, for the position of APC National Chairman. There have been intense lobby for the President to drop Adamu and allow for a contested convention. Most of the other aspirants have kicked against the President\u2019s purported endorsement of Abdulahi Adamu. The lobby to drop Adamu was said to have intensified at the weekend as some governors are preparing to jet to London to mount pressure on Buhari to change his mind on Adamu.\n\nBuhari had assured party members before departing the country for his medical trip, that he would do everything to ensure the convention holds as scheduled on March 26.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress Youth Development and Solidarity Network (APC-YDSN) has alleged fresh plot by some APC Governors to get a court injunction to effectively sack Buni as CECPC Chairman.\n\nThe Secretary General, Mr. Tobias Ogbeh, made this allegation while addressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe group said after the failed leadership change in the party, there had been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\n\nThe group stated: \u201cAs we may be aware, some governors within the party have attempted to change the leadership of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cAs despicable as this might sound, there has been an attempt at effecting a change in the leadership of the party, not on the strength of the interest of the party, but in furtherance of a blind ambition towards taking over the party structure through the back door in the buildup to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that we have it on good authority that since the humiliation suffered by the sponsors of the failed leadership change in the party, there have been concerted efforts to use the instrument of the court to achieve their objective of effecting a change in the leadership of the party.\u201d\n\nThe group warned judges and other officers in the legal profession to refuse to be used as pawns to truncate the democratic processes in Nigeria.\n\nThe group informed all APC stakeholders and members of the general public that part of the new plot was to secure a court judgement through the back door that would sack the party\u2019s leadership from office.\n\nThe scheme, the group alleged, was heavily funded by a serving minister and presidential aspirant from the south.\n\nThe group, therefore, called on the general public to be on the watch as the manifestation of this plot would gather steam soonest.\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, declared at the weekend that in the last seven years of working with President Muhammadu Buhari, there has not been any religious dispute between them.\n\nOsinbajo called on religious leaders to use faith to unite the country and improve the lives of the citizens.\n\nThe vice president spoke while playing host to the Senegal-based Grand Khalifa of Tijjaniya Movement Worldwide, His Eminence, Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Niass, at the State House, Abuja.\n\nOsinbajo described Buhari as a leader who accommodated people of different religious backgrounds, citing his relationship with the president spanning over seven years as a perfect example.\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, \u201cPresident Buhari is a serious Muslim and I am a pastor, both of us have worked together for about seven years, we have not had any issues.\n\n\u201cThe president has shown great leadership, he has shown that he wants a country where people of different faiths live in harmony and with love for one another.\u201d\n\nThe vice president also stressed that beyond the spiritual upliftment of individuals and communities, religious leaders should use faith to promote peace, prosperity, and development of society\n\nOsinbajo, who emphasised the importance of religion in human development, said, \u201cWe must use our faiths to promote peace and prosperity for our people. We need to work together to ensure that our people benefit from religion.\n\n\u201cWe tend to underestimate the importance of religion, despite the fact that it plays a key role in the development of the society, not just in the spiritual aspect, but also physical.\n\n\u201cThere are many nations of the world that have benefitted from the impact of religion, both spiritually and physically. So, we must use religion in our countries (in Africa) to help our people to live better lives because in other parts of the world, leaders of faith have used religion to better the lives of the people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the need for leaders of faith to close ranks for the purpose of using religion to address emerging challenges in the society, the vice president noted, \u201cNo matter what the situation may be, we in Africa must be able to sit together and talk. We must never allow situations where we cannot sit together.\n\n\u201cWith what is going on across the world, people of faith must continue to emphasise that both major religions (Islam and Christianity) promote peace and we must allow our people to practise whatever religion they want to practise.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo praised the leader of the group, while commending the Tijjaniya Movement for its progressive ideals and compassion for the needs of the people.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Sheikh Niass, who spoke in French with interpretation by a spokesman, thanked the vice president for the opportunity to meet with him. He described the vice president as a great personality, the type needed both in Nigeria and Africa.\n\nSheikh Niass stated, \u201cThe vice president is a great personality with an exceptional character, standing on two feet: one as a political leader concerned about the progress of his people and the second, as a man of God.\n\n\u201cAfrica needs a person of your nature with very strong background in religion and politics. I pray that the Almighty Allah will upgrade you and enable you achieve your desires and aspirations because, like I said, not only Nigeria but Africa will benefit from your leadership qualities.\u201d\n\nHe added that Nigeria \u201cis the heart of Africa and whatever Nigeria becomes, Africa becomes.\u201d\n\nThe Tijjaniya leader also expressed the group\u2019s gratitude to Buhari for his support, while praying for his safety and that Nigeria would overcome all its challenges.\n\nOsinbajo promised to convey the Sheik\u2019s warm greetings and appreciations to the president. He also prayed for peace in Nigeria, Africa, and the world.\n\nThe Grand Khalifa of Tijjaniya worldwide and other members of the movement from across Africa had converged on Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, to celebrate the 36th International Maulid Anniversary in honour of the movement\u2019s late leader, Sheikh Ibrahim Niass.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Power Supply Situation Worsening Because Gencos \u2018Owed N1.6tn Since 2013\u2019",
          "text": "Power Generation Companies (Gencos) under the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC) on Sunday stated that the power supply situation in the country was worsening because they were owed over N1.6 trillion since 2013.\n\nAPGC\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr. Joy Ogaji, in a briefing in Abuja, argued that a situation where the energy dispatched by the power generators was used as an index for power generation capacity was detrimental to their survival.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, the already bad power supply situation in the country had worsened as players in the sector continued to trade blames as to whose table the buck stops.\n\n\u201cWe are currently owed N1.644 trillion. One of the reasons that the power plants are down is due to inefficient management of the grid,\u201d Ogaji said.\n\nAccording to her, the Gencos have exhausted all their borrowing sources, as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had reportedly warned the banks to desist from lending money to them.\n\nShe stated, \u201cIf you give us gas, provide forex to carry out maintenance. I have told you most of the units are down and they need money to fix them.\n\n\u201cGive us enough money to pay our gas suppliers because it is pre-payment. But for power, it is take and pay later. There is no way that this misalignment will help us.\u201d\n\nBut Ogaji stated admitted that at the moment, the Gencos were generating an average of 4,000MW.\n\nHowever, the debt claim by the Gencos was immediately refuted by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET). NBET disputed the figures quoted by the power generators, saying only companies with active gas supply and transportation contracts are paid for unutilised capacity.\n\nThe Head, Corporate Communication, NBET, Henrietta Ighomrore, explained that in the country, only five power generation companies with active Gas Purchase Agreement (GPA) were entitled to be paid for unused capacity.\n\nAccording to her, claims that the Gencos have the capacity to generate 9,000MW are not accurate, as inspections by NBET had shown that the so-called capacity does not exist.\n\nEarlier, Ighomrore argued that the Gencos had always been paid as and when due, explaining that in the last payment cycle alone, the Gencos were paid N38 billion for electricity distributed on the grid.\n\nAccording to her, NBET has paid the Gencos over 90 per cent of their invoices. She noted that the company paid the generators almost immediately remittances from the Discos were received.\n\nHowever, Ogaji noted that the illiquidity caused by the huge sums owed the Gencos by NBET had continued to frustrate them and render them incapable of meeting their obligations.\n\nSuch obligations, she said, included Operations and Maintenance (O&M) as and when due, procurement of critical capital, spare parts and accessories, payment, and servicing of existing loans from lenders and financiers and employee- obligations.\n\nOgaji listed foreign exchange as another challenge faced by the hydroelectric power plants, whose concession fees, she maintained were \u201cdollarised.\u201d\n\nShe said most of the electricity generated in Nigeria came from gas-fired turbines, explaining that Gencos have consistently been dealing with unending gas-related challenges, which inhibit optimal generation.\n\nAccording to her, issues of gas volume, gas quality, gas pressure and gas transportation have consistently curtailed capacity utilisation by Gencos thereby affecting generation.\n\nOgaji stated, \u201cUnfortunately, the unenforceable state of the contracts in the NESI and the broken cycle of payment assurance has made the enforcement of what would ordinarily be basic obligations of parties to the industry agreements, impossible.\n\n\u201cSince 2013 when the power sector was partially privatised till date, weak and inadequate infrastructure (transmission and distribution) have continued to render inconsequential, a significant portion of the generation capacities recovered or added by Gencos through huge investments done by them to increase their respective generation capacities.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, while the owners of the Gencos invested and increased generation capacity up to 13,000MW across the country, no corresponding investment and improvement was made at the transmission and distribution ends. The result, she said, was the significant stranded capacity of Gencos.\n\nOgaji added, \u201cThe persistence of this anomaly over these years, compelled Gencos to begin to question the commercial reasonability of continued investment in recovery or expansion of generation capacity that would end up being stranded and not utilised to transmit and distribute electricity to end users who are yearning for same.\u201d\n\nShe said the foundational agreements, which Gencos were told existed before, no longer exists, after they had commenced performance, with dire implication for power generators.\n\nOgaji stated, \u201cWe should address the root cause and not the symptoms, for sustainability of the NESI and the power sector.\n\n\u201cThe current state of the national grid must be addressed, otherwise we will continue to always deny Nigerians their legitimate expectation of unhindered rights to reliable supply of electricity.\u201d\n\nChecks by THISDAY revealed that all the parties\u2019 positions were not entirely accurate. Firstly, it is wrong to claim that only five generation companies have gas supply agreement, meaning that there is no level playing field. Further checks revealed that the Gencos were being owed not only capacity charges but also for interest and energy charges as well \u2013 value which is yet to be determined. And also the forex issue is not restricted to hydros alone, but it affects gas fire and thermal plants as well.\n\nAdditionally, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is equally carrying out maintenance work on their lines. Furthermore, a lot of the gas companies were also doing maintenance work on their infrastructure, limiting supply of gas to generation companies. All these put together made power supply epileptic in the country",

          "text": "The General Overseer of Christ Living Hope Church, Rev. Ugochukwu Ekwem, has been arrested with 54 sticks of drugs wrapped around his body by the operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos while on his way to a three-week crusade in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nA statement on Sunday by the spokesman of the anti-narcotics agency, Femi Babafemi said the youthful and popular preacher who has his church headquarters in Isuaniocha, Mgbakwu road, Awka in Awka North local government area of Anambra state with two other branches in Lagos and Abuja, was arrested last Monday during the outward clearance of passengers on Ethiopian Airlines flight to Nairobi via Addis Ababa.\n\nAccording to Babafemi, when tested, the 54 sticks found on the clergyman proved positive to cannabis. He subsequently confessed during preliminary interrogation that he packed that quantity of illicit substance on his body to use during his three weeks crusade in Kenya.\n\nThe spokesman of the NDLEA also said on the same day, another passenger, Nnakeanyi Chukwuka King who arrived the airport on Ethiopian Airlines flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil via Addis Ababa was intercepted during the inward clearance of passengers at the E-Arrival Hall of the Lagos Airport.\n\nDuring a search of King\u2019s luggage, 40 parcels of cocaine concealed inside bottles of body cream with a gross weight of 9.7 kilogrammes were recovered from him.\n\nBabafemi said three days later on Wednesday, another passenger on Ethiopian Airlines flight to Italy, Mr. Edo Blessing was intercepted at the Departure Hall of the airport with 2,090 tablets of Tramadol 225mg and Flunitrazepam. The suspect who hails from Edo state but lives in Italy has claimed ownership of the recovered psychotropic substances.\n\nOn the same day, operatives arrested a freight agent, Rafiu Abbas at the NAHCO Export Shed of the airport when he presented a cargo containing 19.15 kilogrammes cannabis going to London. The illicit substance was concealed inside plastic containers labelled as \u201cAfrican Dishes\u201d and packed in a bag.\n\nIn a related development, a 63-year-old Vincent Obimma was last Friday arrested with 350 grammes of cocaine and 150 grammes of heroin by NDLEA operatives at a park in the Apapa seaport corridor in Lagos. The drugs were hidden in industrial torch packets heading to Kano, Kano state.\n\nAlso a suspected drug dealer in Kaduna state, James Okenwa has been arrested in a follow-up operation at Central Market, Kaduna. He admitted the ownership of 1,807 bottles of cough syrup with codeine that were earlier recovered from two suspects at the tollgate.\n\nBabafemi said at the point of his arrest, another 152 bottles of the drug were recovered from his vehicle. He has accepted ownership of all the 1,959 bottles of the codeine syrup.\n\nIn Yobe state, two fake security agents: Akalonu Justin and Azimbi Festus who were coming from Onitsha and heading to Maiduguri, Borno state have been arrested with 25 blocks of cannabis dative weighing 12 5 kilogrammes and 1,598 bottles of codeine syrup weighing 159.8 littes, while 85 kilogrammes of cannabis was also recovered from the warehouse of a notorious drug dealer in Pawari area of Damaturu, the state capital last Thursday.\n\nIn Anambra state, a total of 38,605 tablets of assorted opioids were recovered from a 29-year-old drug dealer, Awoke Friday at Nkwelle junction, Onitsha last Friday with the support of men of the Nigeria Police.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman/ Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig.
