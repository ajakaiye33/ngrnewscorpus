People have done things and nobody was held accountable for their failures.\n\n\u201cWhen I was Senate President, we sat down with security agencies and drew a roadmap on how to address the issue of insecurity, but the report was abandoned.\n\n\u201cIf I am the President, I will hold people accountable and they will do what is right to end insecurity and there will be no injustice,\u201d he said.\n\nSaraki further stated that the country was so divided and needed someone that had the capacity and a good grasp of the situation to restore its lost glory and unite the people.\n\nThe PDP Chairman in Plateau, Chris Hassan, told the delegates that Saraki stood with the state during its trying times.\n\nHassan said that Saraki was a stabilising factor that had traversed the length and breadth of the country to reconcile members of the PDP.\n\nThe chairman said that delegates would assess all aspirants and make an informed decision based on their antecedents.\n\nRep Beni Lar, daughter of Chief Solomon Lar, first PDP chairman, in her remarks, said that Nigerians were tired of bloodshed and that Saraki had the capacity to end the killings.\n\nLar urged the presidential aspirant to ensure that women got their 35 per cent affirmation action when elected President come in 2023.\n\nNAN",

          "title": "Kate Henshaw: Fighting for Women\u2019s Rights",
          "text": "During the Easter holidays, lovers of stage plays had an exciting experience with Doyenne Circle\u2019s musical, Ada The Country which had Kate Henshaw as the lead character.\n\nAda The Country tells the story of Ada, who loses her 9-month-old daughter and property in a fire incident in which she barely survives herself. The traumatic experience sends her into depression but with the support of women across different generations, who have been through such harrowing experiences, she is able to walk through a process of restoration.\n\nKate Henshaw, a Microbiology graduate who gave the stage play her 100 percent best, in this interview, says she also enjoys using her influence to positively impact lives, advocate for a better Nigeria, and as well to raise her voice on issues that concern the girl child, women and everyone in general.\n\nStage plays don\u2019t hold regularly like it used to be in the 80s. For practitioners like you, what was is like returning to the stage with Ada The Country?\n\nI\u2019m an advocate for the girl child and for women. I truly do love the stage, very much. So, when I was first approached to star in Ada the Country, I found the title quite intriguing; Ada is the first female child in the Igbo culture and Ada the Country means there is a lot of expectation on her to become the best expectations from society, family, and all.\n\nSo, I was totally and truly delighted to be a part of it the first time. And of course, this is the second installment in 2022. We had a fantastic time. The first time in 2020 and 2022, it was like home to me and I felt really fantastic rehashing, the straight the lines and then added a few more layers to the character to make her believable. I love the title, I love the musical, and it was such a huge honour and pleasure to be a part of it.\n\nHow challenging was it communicating the central theme of the play?\n\nThe only challenge was the rehearsal time. You know that for stage, you need to put in a lot of work rehearsing. You have to go over and over and over again, moving around the state and of course, with the added layer of it being a musical, that, also, added a bit of a challenge to the theme of the play. So, putting that all together and also making time for my other commitments was a bit of a challenge to me, but I took it in my stride. I made sure I gave it 100% each time I had to be at rehearsal to ensure that the character came alive, and it was communicated clearly to the audience.\n\nFrom the whole experience, how best can women going through trauma be helped?\n\nI believe that asking for help does not show a sign of weakness, asking for help is actually saying that you need support. People should not be shy to ask for help or talk to professionals, in order to be counselled. I believe that when you open up your heart and you tell your story, you get some sort of healing. But from that, you also inspire all the people who are going through the same stuff, to come forward and share their own story. It helps others know that they are not alone in whatever situation that they are going through in a society where women are seen and not heard. Women need to raise their voices and ask for help, and of course, having a good support system in terms of family, good friends, does not hurt. Support is very good. No matter what you\u2019re going through, you need good people around you to be able to lift you up out of any situation that you\u2019re going through.\n\nGender based domestic Violence is gradually becoming the order of the day. What do you think can be done to stem this menace?\n\nI think more stringent consequences in terms of punishments should be meted out to perpetrators. No shaming of the victim. No victimization of the person who has gone through domestic violence. Our culture of silence perpetuates this evil. And so, a lot of voices need to be raised.\n\nGender-based violence is something that has been with us for a while, but with the advent of social media, it is now coming to the fore in a huge wave. A lot more needs to be done especially by women to be able to stem this Menace. And of course, we need the relevant authorities to be alive to their responsibilities; name and shame the perpetrators so that people know that these kinds of people are being punished.\n\nSo, I\u2019m an advocate for stringent strong punishment to deter others.\n\nCelebrities are always in the forefront when a gender-based violence occurs. However, most times, they never follow through to ensure the culprit is properly charged. Why is that so?\n\nCelebrities are human beings. They use their platform for those who choose to use their platform, to bring to light, issues that affect the society. This they do in terms of advocacy, film, documentaries, music, in advocating for a better Society. They are human beings like everyone else, so, they cannot do it on their own. They need the support of society, male and female to be able to stop this menace. On them being able to follow through to the end, another thing is the length of time that it takes for prosecution and for judgment to be served to the perpetrator. You know, after a while, the victim gets tired and feels like, oh, they don\u2019t want to go through it. I have worked with a couple of NGOs, putting out their information, Miracle Center projects a lot of violence against women and children, Chechen Yara, WORRY which is women at risk Foundation. I\u2019ve always supported them in the advocacy, naming and shaming, telling people where they can go to seek help.\n\nFor those in marriage, what would you counsel, especially in a society where single and divorced women are less respected?\n\nWell, like I said, society blames the woman who leaves her marriage even when it is life-threatening. The society is not very kind to single and divorced women because they see them as failures. This needs to stop because they are human beings. They also want a better life for themselves. They need to be alive, to actualize all of their potentials. We need to continue to advocate for kinder words being spoken to survivors of those who have come out of a violent relationship or marriage. Sometimes, these abuses are not only physical, but also, mental and even financial. That\u2019s why in terms of accommodation, you hear some landlords say, they don\u2019t want a single woman. Even when you\u2019re trying to get your passports, as a woman, unless you are already married, they frown at that. You need to have a man\u2019s permission to be able to get this legal document, all of that needs to change.\n\nFrom the play Ada the Country, we see women supporting women but in real world, women have been accused of enforcing obnoxious and archaic traditional practices against their fellow women. How can women make the right changes?\n\nAbsolutely, I always say that women are the gatekeepers to some of this archaic and obnoxious traditional practices like, female genital mutilation, widowhood rights etc. Women are in the forefront and they are the ones who perpetrate this. So, when the men turn around and do the same, they are like, look at your fellow woman, it should not be.\n\nFemale genital mutilation for one has no benefits whatsoever. Cutting part of the vagina of the woman just to make her less promiscuous has no medical benefit to it other than to scar her psychologically and physically.\n\nSo we need good women, we need intelligent women, we need women in the community, we need women leaders, we need market women, we need women in religious societies who will continue to preach and advocate for a saner society and to banish all these traditional practices that are indeed harmful to their fellow women.\n\nThese days celebrities bring to the internet all their private affairs, some really scandalous and damning. What is your view on how your colleagues use the social media?\n\nWell, to each, his own; I will say that we all have choices and whatever we do, there are consequences. I, for one, I\u2019m, okay. I\u2019m just minding my lane, content in focusing on my job and issues. I am passionate about advocating for them and generally sending out a positive vibes. So, to each, his own, everyone is an adult and responsible for how they use the tool of social media, because when the purpose of a tool is not known, abuse is definitely inevitable.\n\nIs that why you kept your daughter away from public eyes?\n\nShe is my business. It\u2019s private. I choose to have a line dividing privacy and public show-off of whatever. I\u2019m a very private person, but it so happens that my life is my work and that makes some part of my life public. But, I choose to protect her, but well, she\u2019s an adult now. She can make the choice to go into the social media space knowing fully well that it\u2019s a mixed world out there. So, one has to work circumspectly, treading carefully and know that the kind of information you put out, may be used against you in the future.\n\nSo I choose to keep her away from the public eye as a personal choice.\n\nDo you think social media has done more harm than good?\n\nSocial media, I don\u2019t know if I can say it has done more harm than good. There\u2019s a lot of good that has come from social media. Issues are brought to light that would otherwise not be heard of like gender-based violence, like murder, like laws against women that have not been passed by the National Assembly, laws that favour women, that are not being looked into by the National Assembly. So, social media if it\u2019s not used correctly can turn out to be harmful like, fake information, impersonation of people\u2019s character, using of their images without permission.\n\nSo, we need to be more careful in the usage of social media in terms of disseminating information.\n\nHow did you manage to keep a clean slate in the movie industry, no scandals?\n\nI stayed on my lane. I focused on me and on putting out good stuffs. I focused on trying to make the world a better place, better than how I met it. I am content with what I have. I try not to involve myself in things that are not beneficial to me. I have learnt a lot in my almost 30 years in the film industry that the public stoplight is on you 24/7. So, I am extremely careful about what I put out. I try to put my life private not put out information that I don\u2019t want people to know about. It is important to me that the focus should be on my work and the other good works that I am trying to do.\n\nYou\u2019re still young and beautiful, any second thoughts on remarriage?\n\n(Laughs). Well, never say never at the right time, God will do what He has to do. And if He says \u2018No\u2019 fine and if He says, yes, that is also fine. I am not ruling it out, but I am not actively searching to remarry.\n\nYou have made exercising a way of life for some years now and the result is being commended. Would you have opted to go under the knife?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go under the knife, I am already apprehensive about surgical procedures. I think all my life, I have already had one and that is on my hand when I had an injury. I am happy with my body. I am happy with where I am now, in terms of my fitness and my lifestyle. I\u2019ll continue to advocate for people to make exercising a way of life, because apart from the immense good hormones flooding your system, your organs, your mind, your brain will all benefit from it. And of course, if it is weight loss that you are after, you will also get that. I advocate for people not to take a short cut, but to stay and trust the process because the results are too much to count.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you relax?\n\nWhen I am not working, I love massage because my work is quite stressful. So, I have a nice massage, listen to cool music and dance. Dance is very important to me. I like reading books; Thriller, crime novels. Then, I travel if I can. Sometimes I just rest at home. Switch off phones and have some me time. It is very important.\n\nWhere is your favourite holiday destination?\n\nI have been to a lot of places, as long as it\u2019s not cold. Me and the cold we are not friends. I prefer places that are warm, sunny and breezy with lots of site to see, good food, drinks and chops. Anywhere that is relaxing and take some time off for myself will be destination for me.\n\nWhat gives you the most joy in life?\n\nWhat gives me the most joy in life is being able to use my influence for good, to affect my immediate society and the world at large, to raise my voice on issues that concern the girl child, women and everyone in general.\n\nAlso, to highlight bad practices against individuals, advocating for better governance for the citizens of Nigeria and just lending a voice to help support a better society that we all can benefit from. I am happy that I am able to contribute my own quota joined with others who want the same thing.",

So, when the men turn around and do the same, they are like, look at your fellow woman, it should not be.\n\nFemale genital mutilation for one has no benefits whatsoever. Cutting part of the vagina of the woman just to make her less promiscuous has no medical benefit to it other than to scar her psychologically and physically.\n\nSo we need good women, we need intelligent women, we need women in the community, we need women leaders, we need market women, we need women in religious societies who will continue to preach and advocate for a saner society and to banish all these traditional practices that are indeed harmful to their fellow women.\n\nThese days celebrities bring to the internet all their private affairs, some really scandalous and damning. What is your view on how your colleagues use the social media?\n\nWell, to each, his own; I will say that we all have choices and whatever we do, there are consequences. I, for one, I\u2019m, okay. I\u2019m just minding my lane, content in focusing on my job and issues. I am passionate about advocating for them and generally sending out a positive vibes. So, to each, his own, everyone is an adult and responsible for how they use the tool of social media, because when the purpose of a tool is not known, abuse is definitely inevitable.\n\nIs that why you kept your daughter away from public eyes?\n\nShe is my business. It\u2019s private. I choose to have a line dividing privacy and public show-off of whatever. I\u2019m a very private person, but it so happens that my life is my work and that makes some part of my life public. But, I choose to protect her, but well, she\u2019s an adult now. She can make the choice to go into the social media space knowing fully well that it\u2019s a mixed world out there. So, one has to work circumspectly, treading carefully and know that the kind of information you put out, may be used against you in the future.\n\nSo I choose to keep her away from the public eye as a personal choice.\n\nDo you think social media has done more harm than good?\n\nSocial media, I don\u2019t know if I can say it has done more harm than good. There\u2019s a lot of good that has come from social media. Issues are brought to light that would otherwise not be heard of like gender-based violence, like murder, like laws against women that have not been passed by the National Assembly, laws that favour women, that are not being looked into by the National Assembly. So, social media if it\u2019s not used correctly can turn out to be harmful like, fake information, impersonation of people\u2019s character, using of their images without permission.\n\nSo, we need to be more careful in the usage of social media in terms of disseminating information.\n\nHow did you manage to keep a clean slate in the movie industry, no scandals?\n\nI stayed on my lane. I focused on me and on putting out good stuffs. I focused on trying to make the world a better place, better than how I met it. I am content with what I have. I try not to involve myself in things that are not beneficial to me. I have learnt a lot in my almost 30 years in the film industry that the public stoplight is on you 24/7. So, I am extremely careful about what I put out. I try to put my life private not put out information that I don\u2019t want people to know about. It is important to me that the focus should be on my work and the other good works that I am trying to do.\n\nYou\u2019re still young and beautiful, any second thoughts on remarriage?\n\n(Laughs). Well, never say never at the right time, God will do what He has to do. And if He says \u2018No\u2019 fine and if He says, yes, that is also fine. I am not ruling it out, but I am not actively searching to remarry.\n\nYou have made exercising a way of life for some years now and the result is being commended. Would you have opted to go under the knife?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go under the knife, I am already apprehensive about surgical procedures. I think all my life, I have already had one and that is on my hand when I had an injury. I am happy with my body. I am happy with where I am now, in terms of my fitness and my lifestyle. I\u2019ll continue to advocate for people to make exercising a way of life, because apart from the immense good hormones flooding your system, your organs, your mind, your brain will all benefit from it. And of course, if it is weight loss that you are after, you will also get that. I advocate for people not to take a short cut, but to stay and trust the process because the results are too much to count.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you relax?\n\nWhen I am not working, I love massage because my work is quite stressful. So, I have a nice massage, listen to cool music and dance. Dance is very important to me. I like reading books; Thriller, crime novels. Then, I travel if I can. Sometimes I just rest at home. Switch off phones and have some me time. It is very important.\n\nWhere is your favourite holiday destination?\n\nI have been to a lot of places, as long as it\u2019s not cold. Me and the cold we are not friends. I prefer places that are warm, sunny and breezy with lots of site to see, good food, drinks and chops. Anywhere that is relaxing and take some time off for myself will be destination for me.\n\nWhat gives you the most joy in life?\n\nWhat gives me the most joy in life is being able to use my influence for good, to affect my immediate society and the world at large, to raise my voice on issues that concern the girl child, women and everyone in general.\n\nAlso, to highlight bad practices against individuals, advocating for better governance for the citizens of Nigeria and just lending a voice to help support a better society that we all can benefit from. I am happy that I am able to contribute my own quota joined with others who want the same thing.",

          "text": "\n\nHakeem Adeyinka Balogun, the Creative Director and CEO of King Hakbal International; an established fashion brand is leaving no stone unturned in making a huge impact with his designs, home and abroad.\n\n\n\nKing Hakbal\u2019s bespoke wears speak volume of sartorial elegance, royalty, confidence and culture.\n\n\n\nIn this interview, the Mathematics graduate of The University of Lagos (UNILAG), says he hopes to, one day, style Former President Barack Obama and international music star Sean Combs (P. Diddy).\n\nHe also sheds more light on the problems of the Nigerian fashion industry and the way forward.\n\n\n\nWhat inspired the King Hakbal brand?\n\nI would say royalty, passion, and the eventual joy of wanting to make every man look Royal. I would also say that, my fashion sense is a natural God-given talent that I absolutely had to share with the world. Not sharing it would have been a sin against humanity in my opinion. I have always loved fashion, even, as a kid, but I would say my very fashionable parents were a great influence, especially my mother. She had always dressed my siblings and me with a very high sense of style, and so, I grew up with that standard. What particularly prompted my interest into making others look good was my sincere desire to see everyone looking classy and special. I, sometime, wished I had special powers, because I would have made every single human look lovely every single day. For me, fashion is life and fashion brings out the true beauty in all. These are the major reasons that inspired the King Hakbal Royal Bespoke brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you were starting out, what gave you the confidence that fashion designing is a profitable venture that could put bread on the table?\n\nTo be honest, when I started, I never thought of the financial side of fashion. My main focus was just to make my clients truly happy and basically to deliver a very satisfying value for money service. I will say truly that, all that I have achieved so far is from sheer dint of hard work, perseverance and God\u2019s divine grace. We all never know in the beginning that whatever we set out to do will be a profitable one, or will guarantee bread on the table. But if you are one that never likes to fail, that fear of failure will always keep you driven that, you will always want to do more. So, in a nutshell, I will say that it\u2019s the fear of failure and pure passion that gave me and is still giving me, the confidence that with God by side, He will always provide the next bread on my blessed table.\n\nTo God be all the Glory and praise.\n\nWhat were the initial challenges you encountered and how did you scale the hurdles?\n\nI used to have power problems (Electricity) when I started in 2003. We all know how bad our power situation is but by the grace of God, I saved up for a very good diesel generator; one that can conveniently power all the machines in my factory. That was a very huge achievement for me that year. I look back now and all I can say is \u2018Alhamdulilah Robeel Alameen\u2019. It is really not easy for a young Nigerian entrepreneur that has a very big dream ahead of him or her. I also didn\u2019t get the type of support that I expected to get from family and friends, but God put total strangers in my path and my story changed. These blessed people saw how hard working and passionate I was and kept referring me to other clients until the world knew my name. Social media has also been an amazing platform to show my pieces to the world; I am so thankful for that.\n\n\n\nHaving come this far what lessons have you learnt about fashion designing that can benefit those coming into the profession?\n\nAlways deliver a good job. Listen to your client\u2019s instructions to the letter z. Even if you forget, don\u2019t be too shy to put a call through to ask further questions because at the end of the day, that smile on your client\u2019s face when he or she receives or fits into the outfit is what will guarantee a smooth transaction, and eventually bring more clients to you. I have also learnt that a very good customer service is important. Right from the way you speak to your clients over the phone, to the way you welcome them whenever they are around you will say a lot and help a whole lot in pushing you and your fashion brand forward. Always note that one client is like a million because you never know who is who.\n\nAnother interesting thing that I have learnt is that as a fashion designer, you must always look the part because there is this wise saying that goes \u2013 \u201cWhoever says that he wants to style us, we will be wise enough to see what this so called person has on their own back first.\u201d This will tell us if he truly knows his onions or not. Furthermore, I have also learnt that humility is key. Choose your words very carefully whenever you are around your clients. Being in your presence is an experience for them and it\u2019s up to you to make sure that it\u2019s a fun one that they won\u2019t forget in a rush. This will ensure that you are always in their minds and on their lips whenever they speak about a fashion designer brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has been your best and worst moment so far as a fashion designer?\n\nI have only had best moments because I love what I do. To name one of the many best moments will be taking a bow after the release of my collections on the runway on major platforms. Fashion is life so that makes everyday a chance to make another stunning fashion statement. I always say that the world is my runway and everyone around are my audience. I simply love what I do. I truly can\u2019t see myself doing anything else. God bless the Nigerian fashion industry (Amen).\n\n\n\nWhat motivated you to go to UK and New York?\n\nWhat motivated me to travel abroad was because of my clients in those parts of the world and also to broaden my horizon. I wanted to know and learn more about fashion. I also needed a refreshing inspiration that could bring out an outstanding creative side to my mind. The world is like a book. If we don\u2019t travel the world and stay in just one country, it\u2019s almost like reading just one page in an amazing and adventurous book. I also wanted to see the things that I used to watch on television as a kid in reality. Growing up and till date, I am only drawn to American movies. They actually make me feel like I am partly American deep down. So, travelling to these parts of the world was just out of curiosity and adventure.\n\n\n\nYou are trying to broaden your market to UK, what is unique about the Nigerian fashion industry?\n\nWhat is unique about the Nigerian fashion industry is the Nigerian sense of style and confidence that we Nigerians carry so effortlessly. I, also, particularly love how we Nigerians tend to stand taller and adjust our carriage whenever we are in any of our ethnic or traditional attires. One can immediately see a boost in our self-confidence; watching that transformation is simply priceless to me. This makes me want to share this truly regal Nigerian attires and regalia with the whole world.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow affordable are your designs and who are your target clients?\n\nMy pieces are very affordable for what I deliver. My target clients are men that see themselves as Kings at heart; men that do not see themselves as ordinary, men with a very simple yet outspoken sense of style. Men with class!\n\n\n\nKindly share with us some of the fashion shows you have participated in and which was your best and why?\n\nThe African Fashion Week and the ECOWAS Fashion Week; I particularly loved the African Fashion Week more because it carried so much power and the coordination. The turn-out was huge. I had the sound track from the classic movie \u2013 Coming to America \u2013 And my models dressed in stunning tuxedo, very sharp 3- piece business suits and some Dansiki and Agbada made out of Aso Oke. The screams and applause were extremely overwhelming for me. There is nothing like reaping the fruits of one\u2019s labour.\n\nWho is the perfect King Hakbal Lion Man?\n\nThe perfect King Hakbal Lion Man is one that is fearless in the pursuit of what sets his soul on fire. A King Hakbal Lion Man is also one that sees himself as a King at heart; a driven- man who puts his money where his mouth is. He is also a stand-up man that exudes so much confidence. A King!\n\nWho do you dream to style as a fashion designer and why?\n\nBarack Obama, Sean Diddy Combs. I mentioned these two great men because Barack Obama is my role model. In fact, he is a girl\u2019s dad just like me. He is also very stylish and he has so much swag. Secondly, I mentioned Sean Diddy Combs because he was my fashion idol growing up. He always loved to look sharp at every single chance given to him. He also inspires a whole generation.\n\n\n\nHow friendly is the Nigerian economy to fashion entrepreneurs?\n\nIt is extremely friendly because we Nigerians are so fashion forward. It\u2019s very inspiring. We also have lots of fashion-loving Nigerians in the Diaspora who see the good works that we fashion designers are doing on social media. They have been so supportive financially. Thank God for social media, especially Instagram. Instagram has helped every entrepreneur show their creativity to the world in a very easy, yet professional platform.\n\n\n\nWhat projection do you have for your brand in the next 5 years?\n\nTo be the Royal and Premium Men\u2019s wear brand all over Africa and the world at large. To have stores in major cities all around the world, and to continue to have the high and mighty in the society wear King Hakbal.\n\n\n\nHow do you relax and have time for family?I pray, drink lots of water and go to a private beach house with my family. I also love having conversations with my wife and daughters about almost everything. That really relaxes me as they are the love of my life.",

Apart from her duties at NOWA, Aisha Gambo is also a philanthropist, who prides herself on a lot of philanthropic activities such as providing access to clean water in disadvantaged communities, empowering young and upcoming women in the business world, and offering scholarship opportunities to indigent students; a feat which, recently, earned her a spot as an inductee into the United Nations Humanitarian Hall of Fame.\n\nMrs. Gambo who holds a degree in Geography and Regional Planning from Ahmadu Bello University is also CEO of Framazaz Resources Limited, with several subsidiaries. The businesswoman also has her hand in properties and interior decoration.\n\nAs president of Nowa, what major initiative have you embarked upon to improve the lives of members of your organisation?\n\nSince assuming office, we have done several projects geared towards improving the lives of our people. We have done seminars and training to expose and enhance their livelihoods such as entrepreneurship training to enhance their business skills in topics like negotiating, marketing, profitable pricing, etc. We have held cybersecurity seminars to expose members to the effects, impacts, and detection of cyber fraud. Our members have been engaged with an African study tour that exposed NOWA executives and members to empowerment and welfare programmes, employed by other countries to improve the lives of women and children.\n\nAre you having the impact you hoped your initiative would have at the outset?\n\nI feel very good and blessed about the initiatives I put forth because the impact is felt across the board. There have been an increasing number of participants joining the skills acquisition training center for example, and we have a lot more clamouring for new centers to be built in more states.\n\nOften, we hear and see on TV wives of late military men lamenting that they and their children have been neglected after the death of their husbands.\n\nWhat does Nowa do in such circumstances?\n\nThere is always room for NOWA members in the NOWA organization. We understand that the circumstances are extremely painful, but in our own organizational capacity, we continue to provide opportunities and support for those whose husbands are late and died fighting for our country. NOWA in conjunction with the Nigerian Navy organizes sensitization workshops to sensitize the officers on the benefits of appointing their spouses as next of kin to enable the receipt of benefits and entitlements.\n\nIn what ways do you cater to both the developmental and moral growth of women and children left behind by late officers?\n\nOne of my core beliefs is that we don\u2019t leave anyone behind. We make sure that support is available for widows and their children. We also give work opportunities when the chance arises. In addition, we also offer opportunities for women and youths to learn vocational and entrepreneurship skills, at our skills acquisition centres in Oghara and Lagos. NOWA sponsors the children of late parents through primary and secondary education\n\nYou were inducted into the United Nations Humanitarian Hall of Fame some time ago, what does this mean to you?\n\nThe induction into the Humanitarian Hall of Fame about six months ago means a lot not because of the award itself, but because it means the work I have been doing behind the scenes has been impactful on so many lives, and my efforts have been recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. With or without any awards, it\u2019s in my heart to impact lives and I will continue to do so in any way I see possible.\n\nThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day theme is: \u201cGender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow.\u201d How do you factor this in achieving your goals with regards to Nowa?\n\nNOWA is a strong women association made up of many strong and smart women and that is a vehicle for any initiative regarding the growth of women globally. We align with the International Women\u2019s Day theme \u201cGender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow\u201d because the celebration of women who have done what we aspire to do, encourages more women to push the boundaries for gender equality and a more sustainable future.\n\nHow do you balance being at the head of a property development and interior decorating company at the same time?\n\nBy the Grace of Almighty Allah, I am at the helm of a few different businesses and it can be challenging balancing different businesses in such an environment. I make sure I work with trustworthy people. I also train them and employ those who are willing to work hard and be rewarded accordingly.\n\nHave you always been entrepreneurial? What led you to take that first step in setting up your own business?\n\nYes, by the Grace of God, I have always been entrepreneurial from my childhood days. I got interested in my father\u2019s business ventures; he was also a builder and I noticed how he went about his work. Again, I always assisted my mother in getting things done, whether it was following her to the market, or just handling things around the house. I believe this upbringing grounded me to understand that success in life is a process and a journey.\n\nOver the years, have you encountered any barriers to your success or growth as an entrepreneur?\n\nEveryone experiences challenges in business but, that of a woman can be very different because there are many aspects involved. I had three young kids to take care of while also starting and running my business. Balancing the time my business needed to grow and the amount of time devoted to raising good kids posed a challenge. But with the wisdom and blessings I acquired as a young lady, I was able to make both works and by the Grace of God, raised three beautiful young adults. Another challenge I faced was the thought that business is supposed to be left for men to do. Early on in my career, when some of the men did not understand my passion and capacity, they thought the opportunities I was vying for were too big for me to handle until I was awarded the job and executed well. Consistent delivery was how I was able to continue to build credibility over the years and oftentimes my old clients would refer me to the next client.\n\nWhat event in your childhood years shaped you into the woman you are today?\n\nNo particular event but as mentioned earlier, watching and being involved with my parents activities gave me the courage and confidence to work hard and reach new heights over time.\n\nAs a businesswoman, leader, and philanthropist, what is your vision?\n\nMy vision is to be an inspiration to many people, especially the young and up-and-coming businesswomen in our society. I believe my actions, my stories, and my work, will help motivate and inspire them.\n\nHow does your business experience benefit your current position as president of Nowa?\n\nWell, I can look at the problems we face from a private sector point of view. This allows me to be a bit more hands-on and less bureaucratic in providing solutions to the organization.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about?\n\nMy big focus is on the sustainable development of the less privileged. It has been a passion of mine even before I became the NOWA President. I have taken pride in doing a lot of philanthropic activities such as providing access to clean water in communities, empowering young and upcoming women in the business world, scholarship programmes to mention a few.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish within the next year?\n\nOne of the biggest projects I would like to accomplish in the next year is the hospital we plan to build for women and children. This would be a specialized 200-bed hospital that would be equipped to handle all the necessary care for women and children. We plan to build it in three locations (Abuja, Kano, and Port Harcourt).\n\nYou look very fashionable. What\u2019s fashion like for you?\n\nWell, fashion is also an expression for me, it can be therapeutic to wear nice clothes and feel confident in them, and so I am intentional about that. I like my clothes simple but elegant.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing in your free time?\n\nBecause I am extremely busy with a lot of engagements with my different businesses, I enjoy resting, sleeping, and taking time for myself whenever I get the chance. I don\u2019t compromise on that and I think it\u2019s an important aspect that many busy people should focus on. I also enjoy listening to music and The Holy Quran.\n\nWhat is the one piece of advice you would give any young woman reading this?\n\nThe one piece of advice I would give any young woman reading this is, to understand that success is a process, there\u2019s a journey to it and it doesn\u2019t come as fast as social media might want to make you believe. Work hard, develop yourself because no one can ever take that away from you, be confident, and associate with the right people.",

          "text": "The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to dismiss a legal action instituted against him by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) to challenge the validity of the Rules of Professional Conduct for lawyers in the country.\n\nMalami, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said that the NBA\u2019s suit against him was incompetent and lacking in merit because its facts were founded on falsehood and hearsay.\n\nThe AGF, in a reply to the NBA\u2019s court action, maintained that he was constitutionally empowered to formulate and amend the Rules of Professional Conduct for legal practitioners in Nigeria.\n\nIn his counter-affidavit against the suit and filed by his lead counsel, Maimuna Lami Shiru, Malami insisted that he did not unilaterally amend the contentious law for lawyers as alleged by NBA.\n\nHis eight-paragraph affidavit against the suit was deposed to by one Oni Michael, a litigation officer in the Civil Litigation and Public Law Department in the AGF\u2019s office.\n\nHe denied all allegations of wrongdoings brought against him by the NBA in the suit.\n\nContrary to the NBA\u2019s claim that he unilaterally amended the rules, Malami stated that members of the General Council of the NBA were invited and held a meeting with him on the issue.\n\nThe counter-affidavit read in part, \u201cThe defendant (AGF) did what he is statutorily empowered to do strictly within the confines of the law as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation and the President of the General Council of the Bar.\n\n\u201cThat a meeting was called and members of the Council were duly notified and present at the meeting.\n\n\u201cThat the Attorney General of the Federation is statutorily empowered to improve the professionalism of legal practice in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat the plaintiff (NBA) is bringing this court action based on mere speculation and hearsay as he is not a member of the General Council of the Bar.\u201d\n\nMalami specifically averred that all those who made averments on behalf of the NBA did so without recourse to the provision of the law as they are not members of the body vested with powers on the Rules of Professional Conduct for lawyers.\n\nThe AGF, therefore, asked the court to dismiss the suit against him for being incompetent.\n\nAlthough Malami claimed a meeting was held on the contentious law, DAILY POST however noted that he did not indicate the date and venue of the meeting in his counter-affidavit.\n\nThe Incorporated Trustees of the NBA had dragged the AGF before the court challenging the validity of the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners (Amendment) Rules 2021 (S.I. No. 15 of 2020) enacted by the Attorney General of the Federation.\n\nThe suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/77/2022 was filed against Malami on January 24 2022 by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, Mr Sunday Ibrahim Ameh on behalf of the NBA.\n\nNBA faulted the rules as being unlawful and prayed the court to void and set them aside in the interest of justice and fairness to practising lawyers in Nigeria.\n\nThe association specifically asked the court to interpret sections 1, 11, 12 and 20 of the Legal Practitioners Act and determine whether the AGF, who is just one member of the bar, can act alone in the discharge of functions of the NBA Council without the inputs or contributions of other members of the Council or in consultation with them.\n\nNBA also prayed the court to further interpret the sections of the Act and determine whether the AGF can validly and without any recourse to the General Council of the Bar or consultations with other members to amend, purport to amend or to have amended the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners through the instrumentality of the Rules of Professional Conduct for legal practitioners dated September 3, 2020, and contained in Nigeria\u2019s official gazette number 140, volume 107 of September 7 2020.\n\nUpon proper interpretation of the sections of the Act, the NBA asked the court to declare that the AGF, who is just one member of the General Council of the Bar, cannot act alone in the discharge of the functions of the Council without the input or contributions of other members of the Council or in consultation with them.\n\nNBA prayed the court for an order setting aside or nullifying the purported Rules of Professional Conduct for legal practitioners as purportedly made unilaterally by the AGF on September 3, 2020.\n\nThe NBA also applied for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the AGF, his agents and servants from giving effect or further giving effect to the contentious Rules of Professional Conduct for legal practitioners Rules 2020 purportedly made on September 3, 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, a hearing in the suit will hold on May 12 before Justice Donatus Okorowo.\n\nThough the hearing was initially slated for March 24, and Malami served with a hearing notice in the suit marked FHC/ ABJ/ CS/ 77/2022, he neither appeared in court nor was represented by a legal practitioner while no explanation was offered for his absence.",

          "text": "In many societies, especially in Africa, people view left handedness as odd, unusual segment of the population and as such, they face prejudice, embarrassment and, even insult.\n\nImagine if Adesola were right handed and he passes a plate to his mother with his left hand, the result of that action is better left imagined because the action is intended.\n\nBut here we have a child born a lefty and he considers he does right by using his left hand to carry out activities; observers ask if the society should frown at that irrespective of cultures and beliefs?\n\nThe use of left hand for domestic activities in both a right-handed and left-handed is considered to be disrespectful and broadly disapproved in many cultures, especially in Nigeria, which observers raise concern about.\n\nAmong the Yoruba in the south-western part of Nigeria for instance, people pride themselves as a people with rich culture, tradition and social identity.\n\nAccompanying this cultural identity are so many customs, religious beliefs, superstitions and taboos; and one of such taboos is left-handedness.\n\nIn a world where the usual is normal, criticism and questions arise when the unusual happens.\n\nWhen a child is born and starts to use the left hand, many questions come up. Is this child normal? Is this a sign of something evil? Or will the child become undisciplined?\n\nIn some societies, lefties or \u201cSouthpaws\u2019\u2019 are linked to witchcraft or considered strange members of the society viewed with suspicions.\n\nIn some instances, left-handers face discrimination and they are, somewhat, considered \u201cunlucky\u2019\u2019 while some parents force many of them to use the right hand, especially for eating and collecting things from other people.\n\nHowever, psychologists say parents and guardians ought to know that children have no power over certain things about their creation left-handedness, inclusive.\n\nThis assertion notwithstanding, Malam Haroon Abdullah, a Muslim cleric, insists that Islam prohibits certain actions to be performed with the left hand and there are no shortcuts to it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a sin to be left-handed in Islam, but there are some things you have to do with your right hand.\n\n\u201cIslam prohibits making use of the left hand for certain things such as eating and drinking, so it\u2019s a dicey thing as it is but the place of Islam is very clear about this.\n\n\u201cIslam is a religion that embraces customs and ethics of every tribe that promotes the moral life of the community and it must be adhered to.\n\n\u201cIf a community detests the use of left hand to do certain things such as giving people things with left hand, one should observe.\n\n\u201cIt is detestable (makruh) to offer things to people with the use of left hands and a parent should encourage the child to use right hands, but if it affects the persons intellectual growth, it\u2019s good to leave the child,\u2019\u2019 he notes.\n\nBut a lefty, Mr Oluwasola Akindayini, a baker, says being a left-handed does not mean he is disrespectful in any way.\n\n\u201cBeing a left-hander is a blessing and I don\u2019t feel bad being a left hander. I feel it makes me unique; it\u2019s very wrong to change a lefty to be right-hander.\n\n\u201cI had experienced a kind of stigma when I was young. I was told to do things with my right hand, even to give people money. I remember being slapped for giving a woman, money with the left hand.\n\n\u201cMy parents wanted to change me but they eventually understood that this was beyond my making and they made peace with it,\u2019\u2019 he explains.\n\nCorroborating Akindayini, Mr Michael Chidubem, a biochemistry student of the University of Ilorin, says attempting to change a left-handed could have negative effects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right, especially at young age, because the child will spend more time changing to right hand rather than putting the brain to better use, using left hand is a unconscious act and the child doesn\u2019t have any control of it.\n\n\u201cWhen someone reminds me, especially in restaurant, by saying how do you eat with left hand I usually reply by saying also how do you eat with right hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what I have power over, it\u2019s how I am, it\u2019s not really my doing, God created me like this,\u2019\u2019 he explains.\n\nIn his view, Oluwbukola Akanni, a journalist, who used her left hand initially and voluntarily changed to her right hand, says she was conscious of her decision.\n\n\u201cGrowing up I drew, I wrote with my left hand and luckily for me my parents didn\u2019t try to change that.\n\n\u201cI guess going to school and seeing other people do things differently was a changing point for me, so I became more conscious about it, as we speak I can use both hands,\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\nDr Ogabi Osigwe, a neurologist explains that \u201cthose that function with their left hands have no power or control over such thing; it is how they are wired, the motor portion of one side of the brain controls the movements of the opposite side of the body\u2019\u2019.\n\nIn recognition of the position of left-handers whose population is estimated at 10 per cent of the world population, International Left-Handers Day is celebrated on every Aug. 13.\n\nIt is an international day inaugurated by Dean Campbell, founder of the Lefthanders International in 1976 to celebrate the differences and distinctiveness of left handed individuals and their uniqueness.\n\nWith this, left-handedness has been recognised as a unique trait. Left-handers are not forced to be right-handers and their creativity, uniqueness and ability to do things in their own way have been recognised.\n\nOn International Left-Handers Day, many left-handed friendly products are launched, and awareness of the advantages and disadvantages are spread.\n\nAll in all, psychologists have found out that lefties are smarter, have better memories and they can remember the exact dates of events; play video and other games better with better understanding of art.\n\nThey also observe that lefties have some disadvantages, including being more worried about mistakes they could make and their concern when they are challenged or criticised which may stimulate anger among them.(NANFeatures)",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nNorthern Elders Forum (NEF) has flayed the Presidency for blaming the opposition and the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, for the delay by the United States in delivering 12 Super Tucano jet fighters for the Air Force to fight insecurity across the country.\n\nThe Presidency in a recent statement by Garba Shehu had blamed Kukah and opponents of government for creating the wrong perception of Christianity and Islam relations in Nigeria, which led to the delay in the supply of fighter jets to the country by the US.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nBut NEF\u2019s Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, speaking on an AIT programme, yesterday, faulted the Presidency over the way it responds to criticisms.\n\nHe said Nigeria has a problem procuring weapons because of the conduct of its armed forces and related agencies on human rights issues, its dealings with prisoners of war and citizens caught up in conflicts.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows this. They will not sell you one bullet unless they are satisfied that you\u2019ve met certain criteria. And they have raised issues over and over and over again. The Nigerian government knows this. But they need to improve the conduct of the Nigerian military, in the fight against the insurgency, against terrorists. They know this.\u201d\n\nBaba-Ahmed said rather than blame Kukah or the northern elders group, the Federal Government should ensure the country\u2019s military operations satisfy the basic standards demanded by US weapon suppliers to facilitate easy purchase of fighter jets. He tasked government to reassess the way it wages the war against insurgency and terrorism to avoid issues that lead to delays in weapons procurement from Western countries.\n\nNEF also reiterated its earlier call for President Muhammadu Buhari to resign if he is unable to resolve the nation\u2019s security problems.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cYou know, the presidency spokespersons have a way of deflecting criticism by making it personal. When you say that there is a shortfall in the quality of government, they find something to stick you with. People like Bishop Kukah and I are used to this. We don\u2019t take it seriously. This organisation should be criticised and must be criticised, and those who are ready to do so should be willing to take some of the words that Garba Shehu and Femi Adesina recycle every once in a while when we point out certain facts about the failings of the president in terms of securing the country.\u201d\n\nBaba-Ahmed who noted that it was regrettable that whoever pointed out flaws of the Buhari government is attacked by his spokespersons, said if the military does the right thing, by complying with standards set by western arms-selling countries, they would always get weapons.\n\n\u201cSo, whether it comes from Bishop Kukah or it comes from me, we made this point. We want to buy weapons from some countries, improve the way we wage this war. It can be done, it must be done if you want these weapons. You certainly don\u2019t want to go the option of some other members of the government who say procure weapons from anywhere in the world or just bring in mercenaries to fight a war for you. So, I agree with Bishop Kukah that government needs to review its attitude, some of those issues raised by countries that are creating problems, well, seemingly creating problem for us in terms of selling weapons, and that the onus is on us to improve those conditions. It is fact and we need it now.\n\n\u201cWe must not go to the 2023 elections with the current state of insecurity or a worse state of insecurity, not just because of the elections, but because life is getting worse by the day and it is time to reverse this trend. We cannot continue to live like this. Every inch of this country has one form of security challenge and there are solutions to them. It cannot be that there are no solutions to the insecurities.\n\n\u201cSo, if we can, so, if there are solutions, you have to ask, is the problem with the people who are supposed to find the solution? Are you saying that we can\u2019t deal with bandits and kidnappers and IPOB and ESN and people who are making billions of money from oil theft and using it for other illegal activities?\n\n\u201cThere must be something wrong in the way we are running the country. We should say so. We should raise our voices and demand that the people we voted into office, the president, the National Assembly, governors, they must do better. We can\u2019t live like rats hiding in holes and running away every year from criminals. We just can\u2019t. We\u2019re tired. If they can\u2019t operate the country, there is an option. There is a provision in the constitution for stepping down if you can\u2019t perform the most basic function available to you, which is to protect and secure citizens. That\u2019s what we\u2019re saying, but a few people thought that extreme, but it is a statement of fact.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Over 40 million Nigerians on microblogging platform\n\nWorld\u2019s richest man, billionaire Elon Musk has reached an agreement to acquire Twitter for approximately $44 billion, the company said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press (AP), Musk, the outspoken Tesla CEO, the world\u2019s wealthiest person, had said he wants to buy Twitter because he thinks it\u2019s not living up to its potential as a platform for \u201cfree speech.\u201d\n\nHe said it needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the \u201csocietal imperative\u201d of free speech.\n\nTwitter said it would become a privately held company after the sale is closed.\n\n\u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,\u201d its CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet. \u201cDeeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nMusk describes himself as a \u201cfree-speech absolutist,\u201d although he hasn\u2019t been exactly clear what he means by that. In a recent TED interview, the billionaire said he\u2019d like to see Twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it. He said he\u2019d be \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans. He also acknowledged that Twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world.\n\nThe shares of Twitter, which has over 40 million Nigerians on its platform, were up 4.5 per cent in pre-market trading in New York at $51.15.\n\nMusk, a prolific Twitter user, has said it needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech.\n\nThe 50-year-old entrepreneur, who is also CEO of rocket developer SpaceX, has said he wants to combat trolls on Twitter and proposed changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, including slashing its price and banning advertising.\n\nThe billionaire, a vocal advocate of cryptocurrencies, has also suggested adding dogecoin as a payment option on Twitter.\n\nHe had said Twitter\u2019s current leadership team was incapable of getting the company\u2019s stock to his offer price on its own, but stopped short of saying it needs to be replaced.\n\n\u201cThe company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,\u201d Musk said in his offer letter last week.\n\nUp to the point Musk disclosed a stake in Twitter in April, the company\u2019s shares had fallen about 10 per cent since Parag Agrawal took over as CEO from founder Jack Dorsey in late November.\n\nThe deal came just four days after Musk unveiled a financing package to back the acquisition. This led Twitter\u2019s board to take his offer more seriously and many shareholders to ask the company not to let the opportunity for a deal slip away, Reuters reported on Sunday. Before Musk revealed the financing package, Twitter\u2019s board was expected to reject the bid, sources had said.\n\nThe sale represented an admission by Twitter that Agrawal was not making enough traction in making the company more profitable, despite being on track to meet ambitious financial goals the company set for 2023. Twitter\u2019s shares were trading higher than Musk\u2019s offer price as recently as November.\n\nMusk unveiled his intention to buy Twitter on April 14, and take it private via a financing package comprised of equity and debt.\n\nWall Street\u2019s biggest lenders, except those advising Twitter, have all committed to provide debt financing.\n\nMusk\u2019s negotiating tactics \u2013 making one offer and sticking with it \u2013 resembles how another billionaire, Warren Buffett, negotiates acquisitions. Musk did not provide any financing details when he first disclosed his offer for Twitter, making the market skeptical about its prospects.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\u2022Declare Yoruba\u2019s presidential bid inelegant\n\n\u2022Say unfortunate Jonathan allowed himself to be disgraced\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, and other major socio political groups in different parts of the country, including Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Middle Belt Forum (MBF), have called on Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu and other South West aspirants to withdraw from the 2023 presidential race, insisting it is the turn of the South East to produce President.\n\nThe call is coming as political parties set for their primaries ahead of the 2023 general election. The call by the prominent socio-political groups reflects the sentiment in the country which increasingly favours the emergence of a president of Igbo extraction.\n\nAfenifere, PANDEF and Middle Belt Forum insisted the South East should produce the president of Nigeria in 2023 for equity, justice and fairness. The groups maintained that if the political class and the retired military generals could concede the presidency to the Yoruba in 1999, the same approach could be adopted to micro-zone power to the Igbo.\n\nThey described the Yoruba presidential ambition as awkward.\n\nThe groups spoke in Abuja at the Greater Nigeria Conference, organised by leaders and friends of the South East Geo-political zone, with the theme, \u201cTogether We Can.\u201d\n\nLeaders of the different groups also condemned what they called a doomed 2023 presidential desire by former President Goodluck Jonathan, saying he would merely be presenting himself for shame.\n\nAfenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, while addressing the conference, said there was need for aspirants from the south, especially, the Igbo, to be united. Adebanjo said the decisions of presidential aspirants, like Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Ameachi, and the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, both from the South-south, to contest would only give the north undue advantage over the south.\n\nStating emphatically that the north did not want to leave power in 2023, Adebanjo explained, \u201cI only like to point to the fact that they are just deceiving you. All that you are hearing that they (the north) are supporting the South-west is an element of deceit to deprive you, to be able to rule you. They don\u2019t like anybody!\n\n\u201cI told Bola (Tinubu) himself, not in the papers, face-to-face, \u2018You believe this man (Buhari) will make you president?\u2019 He said yes. I said, \u2018he wanted to make you president, he asked (Yemi) Osinbajo to contest? He asked (Kayode) Fayemi to contest, he asked Amosun (Ibikunle) to contest? All in the South-west, why? He wanted to divide the Yoruba first.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is that President Goodluck Jonathan allowed himself to be disgraced by mentioning the fact that he was considering whether to be president, for what?\u201d\n\nAdebanjo wondered why political leaders from the north were now propounding a lot of theories, when they realised it was the turn of the Igbo to produce the president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow that it is the turn of the Igbo, they are propounding a new theory: it must be based on merit and all that. If it is the question of merit, if it has been based on merit till today, till Kingdom comes, the Igbo alone will produce the president.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader noted that all the talk about aspirants from the south going to lobby, campaign, and sell themselves was all rigmarole, stressing that the north knows the truth.\n\nAdebanjo advised, \u201cAlthough, I don\u2019t like all the people that came out from the east. But for the fact that they are saying you have no people, I\u2019m happy you demonstrated that. But go and unite. A house divided against itself will not stand.\u201d\n\nPANDEF leader, Chief Edwin Clark, also appealed for concession of the presidency to the Igbo in 2023. Clark said Nigeria could not be described as a tripod anymore, because of the country\u2019s current \u201c36 legs\u201d. He said if any part of these \u201c36 legs\u201d got broken, the country would not be at ease, stressing that is what the country is experiencing today.\n\nClark stated, \u201cThe young ones who belong to the disadvantaged legs are fighting and people are pretending not to know why. The other part of this disturbing issue is the question of who has the right over Nigeria? Who is that child, from what part of Nigeria? Who will say no, you cannot destroy our country? You can no longer relegate us to the background.\n\n\u201cWhat right does the antagonist have that the protagonist does not have? What right do you have that the man you are accusing of disturbing you does not have? The reality is that the man, who wants to destroy and the one who is preventing the destruction have equal rights.\n\n\u201cWhy the Igbo should have the presidency is because the children from that geo-political zone are asking whether their own leg is k-legged, or deformed or broken, thus, resulting in the inability of their zone to present the president?\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman noted that if five or more legs out of the 36 legs of the pot were broken, definitely, the pot would be unable to stand. He said during the civil war, one out of the original three legs of the three-legged pot was broken due to the war, and the Igbo, which was the broken leg, had been marginalised in the political equation of Nigeria.\n\nInsisting that the people of the Igbo deserved to have a sense of belonging in Nigeria, Clark stressed, \u201cSo, the clamour for a president for the South-east geo-political zone is supported by me. Today, with no other tangible reason for still wanting to hold on to power, some people are talking about merit and competence. To these people, my response is simple: we must all woo and win each other, because every part of this country has a beautiful bride and every part has a handsome groom.\n\n\u201cIt will not cost money or anything to make Nigeria better. All that is required is for us to demonstrate reciprocal respect, love and understanding to one another. Let us do what is right; let us accommodate one another, and be fair to one another. Let all other Nigerians support a south-eastern candidate for president, come 2023.\n\n\u201cI repeat, very soon, I will be 95 years old. I have spent more than 70 years of this period in Nigerian affairs. I have seen it all. For the peace and sanity of the country, I appeal to all, in the name of the Almighty God, to make this concession to the Igbo, to present a president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDelivering his keynote address, leader of MBF, Dr. Poju Bitrus, said the north should have a rethink of its 2023 presidential ambition, stressing that Nigerians are not fools.\n\nBitrus said it was unfortunate there were people who felt without terrorising the country, they could not continue to rule.\n\nBitrus stated, \u201cIf we look at what is happening in this country now, someone could be surprised why the north, after the monumental failures within this period, will even be contemplating to again want to rule after Buhari. But the unfortunate thing is that everybody thinks if one of theirs is not there, they will be short-changed. How, is the question?\u201d\n\nHe said it would be disingenuous for anyone in 2022 to argue that where the president of Nigeria came from did not matter. If it did not matter, he stated, northern governors and sitting governors would not jeopardise the chances of their own party and give the presidency to the opposition in 2015.\n\nThe MBF leader said it was shocking that the same characters that were groaning in 2014 over zoning in PDP were now arguing that the zone that produced the president did not matter.\n\nBitrus stated that by 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari would have spent eight years as president, adding that it is only fair and equitable that a Nigerian from the southern part of the country occupies the position of president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn the collective wisdom of the departing military and the political class, it was agreed that zoning presidential power to the south-westerner was the most expedient thing to do. At the end of the day, two south-westerners in the persons of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, representing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Chief Olu Falae, representing an alliance of All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) emerged.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 scenario is something similar to what we are having now. The situation we are in now calls for a similar approach by Nigeria. We have to develop a nation; we cannot continue to afford to remain as so many nations within a state. To have a nation we can all call our home, we need justice, equity and fairness.\u201d\n\nThe MBF leader insisted that it would be inelegant for the Yoruba to contest for the position of the president in 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut we believe that it is clumsy and inelegant for the South-west to seek the presidency at this time. Not after Obasanjo\u2019s eight years as president and Osinbajo\u2019s eight years as vice president.\n\n\u201cFor us, the debate should be a straight one between the South-south and the South-east. But the South-south has occupied the seat of president for one term and the South-east has never occupied it at all. The north that presently is occupying the number one position in Nigeria and the South-west that has been served should not entertain any thought of throwing their hats in the ring.\n\n\u201cAfter your own region has been served a consensus to stabilise the Nigerian polity and give its people a sense of belonging, it would amount to taking the food tray away in a banquet hall after dishing enough food to one\u2019s plate. Of course, others on the queue will be well within their right to chase and deal with such selfish people.\u201dEven out there in the north, there is a division. The insurgents, the killing, the abduction for ransom have opened people\u2019s eyes to know that all is not well. It is only proper that we take this thing to the south and it is the turn of the South-east to produce the president.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022US spends $768m to fight malaria in country\n\n*ExxonMobil spent over $37.4m on anti-malaria programmes in nation in 20 years\n\n\u2022Obaseki canvasses innovative financing in the disease fight\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\n\n\nAs the world yesterday marked the World Malaria Day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has disclosed that no fewer than 602,000 people died of malaria in Nigeria and other African countries in 2021.\n\nWHO\u2019s Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, stated this yesterday, in her message to commemorate this year\u2019s World Malaria Day titled: \u201cHarness innovation to reduce the malaria disease burden and save lives.\u201d\n\nShe noted that, \u201cMalaria remains a significant public health and development challenge. In the last year, about 95 per cent of the estimated 228 million cases occurred in the WHO/AFRO Region, along with 602,020 reported deaths.\n\n\u201cSix of our countries, the worst-impacted by malaria in the region, are reported to have accounted for up to 55 per cent of cases globally, and for 50 per cent of these deaths.\u201d\n\nThe commemoration of World Malaria Day is marked annually to focus global attention on the disease and its devastating impact on families, communities, and societal development, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nMoeti said the past year saw significant breakthroughs in malaria prevention and control, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cDespite some slowing of progress to reduce malaria cases and deaths, and the disruptions to health services caused by COVID-19, we are still much further ahead than we were in 2000. We need to reignite that momentum and build on the recent advances.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to reduce the number of people catching and dying from malaria. This requires a focus on research and on leveraging available evidence to ensure that our targeted interventions are an efficient use of resources, which produce measurable results,\u201d she added.\n\nHowever, the United States yesterday disclosed that it spent $768 million from 2011 to date to fight the disease in Nigeria.\n\nPrecisely, in 2021 alone, the United State revealed that it spent $74 million on malaria scourge despite the outbreak of COVID-19 and new demand on combating the global challenge of the pandemic.\n\nA statement yesterday, by US Embassy in Nigeria, stated that the US President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI) had partnered with Nigeria to fight malaria since 2011, contributing $768 million to date and $74 million in full year 2021.\n\nThe PMI\u2019s Annual Report, released yesterday showcased how the strong partnership between the United States and Nigeria enabled robust and effective malaria services to continue in FY 2021, even as COVID-19 caused enormous strain on the health system.\n\nIt added that: \u201cThrough PMI funding and programmes, 58 million bed nets, 130 million fast acting medicines, and 82 million malaria test kits have been delivered to clinics and communities since 2011.\n\n\u201cIn addition, 24 million preventive treatment doses were delivered to pregnant women and 13 million doses to children during the rainy season. In the past year, more than 3,666 health workers received training that amplified their ability to detect and treat malaria, while strengthening the health system overall and providing key skills to fight COVID-19 and future pandemics.\u201d\n\nThe statement quoted the USAID Mission Director Anne Patterson to have said: \u201cI think what Nigeria is doing to advance more effective malaria prevention, treatment, and control is so important, especially the introduction of innovative tools to make better use of the data in real-time, and also to enhance quality of care via community-based health workers.\u201d\n\nAssisted by PMI investments, Nigeria is progressing its fight against malaria using proven and cost-effective methods that save lives and promise a healthier and prosperous future for families and communities, according to the statement.\n\nExxonMobil Spent over $37.4m on Anti Malaria Programmes in Nigeria in 20 Years\n\nIn a related development, American oil and gas giant, ExxonMobil, said it invested more than $37.4 million or over N15 billion in Nigeria-based malaria programmes since 2002 through its humanitarian organ, the ExxonMobil Foundation.\n\nIt explained that the fund was spent in cash grants to partners working to develop community-based solutions in Nigeria since 2002.\n\nThe international oil company (IOC) said in the last 20 years, the foundation had embarked on funding community education, providing tools for prevention and treatment of the disease and training of health workers, adding that its 2022 grant recipients focused on leveraging the power of sports to engage Nigerian youth.\n\nThe foundation in collaboration with ExxonMobil affiliate companies in Nigeria, also announced renewed support for partner organisations committed to ending malaria in Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday, it explained that these grants, among other scheduled activities for World Malaria Day, marked the 20th anniversary of ExxonMobil\u2019s support for programmes to reduce the burden of malaria in Nigeria.\n\nMarking its 20th year of malaria fight in Nigeria and in continuation of this legacy, the oil major has, however, announced its 2022 grant recipients.\n\nThey included PanAfricare, in conjunction with NBA Power Forward, to foster the development of youth in Nigeria through sports, life skills and malaria education; and Grassroot Soccer, to use the convening power of soccer to increase awareness of malaria and HIV/AIDS among young people across Nigeria through sports curriculum.\n\nAnother recipient is Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, aimed to advance scientific knowledge and understanding to advance progress toward the eradication of malaria.\n\n\u201cThis World Malaria Day, we mark ExxonMobil\u2019s contributions over the past two decades that have helped equip and strengthen resilience within our communities to fight against malaria.\n\n\u201cThanks to these efforts, Nigeria is better prepared to continue the progress we have made and work toward a malaria-free future,\u201d Chairman and Managing Director, ExxonMobil affiliate Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Richard Laing, said.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s Malaria Initiative works with nonprofit partners and leading global health organizations to advance progress against the disease in malaria-endemic countries by supporting malaria education and awareness, improving access to tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, strengthening health infrastructure and advancing research and innovation.\n\nThe initiative continues to support malaria prevention and control programs in Nigeria, a country which currently accounts for more than one quarter of the global burden of the disease.\n\nIn honor of World Malaria Day, the company said these partners were focused on leveraging the power of sports and media to reach Nigerian youth, through malaria-themed tournaments and creative radio, television and school-based malaria campaigns, among other activities.\n\nObaseki Canvasses Innovative Financing in Anti-malaria Fight\n\nMeanwhile, Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has urged stakeholders to explore innovative approaches to financing efforts and technologies for the prevention and control of malaria disease so as to realise the global zero malaria target.\n\nThe governor made the call in commemoration of World Malaria Day, yesterday, to highlight the need for continued investment and sustained political commitment to malaria prevention and control.\n\nObaseki urged youths to support the global effort to eliminate malaria by developing innovations and technologies for the prevention and treatment of the disease.\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cAs we commemorate this year\u2019s World Malaria Day, we must reinforce efforts and strengthen alliances to reduce the burden of the malaria disease, one of the world\u2019s oldest and deadliest diseases estimated to have claimed over 627, 000 lives in about 85 countries in one year.\n\n\u201cWhile governments across all levels intensify efforts at improving community-focused malaria interventions, especially in hard-to-reach communities, global stakeholders must strive to bridge the funding gap in achieving a future free of malaria by exploring innovative approaches to stimulate investments in the prevention and control of the disease.\n\n\u201cIf the 2030 zero-malaria target must be achieved, we must embrace multi-sectoral collaborations, public-private partnerships and technology-led solutions, leveraging on the innate potential of the youths, to establish a robust malaria control programme, ensuring the prevention, detection and cure of the disease.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who noted that his government had embarked on interventions, including the distribution of treated mosquito nets, advocacy and others to ensure that the people are properly equipped to fight malaria, said the state is revamping its health system to bring quality primary healthcare closer to citizens.\n\nHe noted that his administration had also ramped up the construction of primary healthcare centres at the ward level across the state, ensuring that each centre is equipped with the right manpower and equipment to sustain the campaign against malaria and other infectious diseases.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Buhari mourns over 100 persons killed in Imo explosion, says it\u2019s national disaster *Insists those responsible must be brought to justice *Directs security agencies to clamp down on oil theft\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIIn furtherance of Operation Dakatar Da Barawo (OPDDB) that was launched to checkmate crude oil theft and related acts of economic sabotage, the Nigerian Navy said it seized 6, 000, 000 litres of stolen crude oil estimated at N264 billion.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed \u201cshock and trauma\u201d about the death of over 100 people in an explosion at an illegal oil refinery in Imo State.\n\nHowever, there were no report of seized barges and motherships by the Navy, unfortunately, that is where most of the theft occur because these are the means by which stolen crude oil are being transported to international market and sold at far below the market price. And sadly this is occurring right under the nose of the security agencies some of who the government has acknowledged collude with the the criminals to shortchange the country.\n\nFollowing the alarming increase of crude oil theft, the president had directed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, to ensure that the criminal activity was brought to a halt. Buhari\u2019s directive had followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOwing to the directive, the naval troops disclosed that they recorded more arrests and seizures between April 15th and 23rd, 2022, being the third week of the operation.\n\nA statement issued by Naval Headquarters stated that the Nigerian Navy Ship (NNS) DELTA in Warri, deactivated an Illegal Refining Site (IRS) around Sara creek.\n\nThe IRS had 16 ovens, 16 metal storage tanks and three wide pits filled with about 500,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, as well as 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil, a generator and 4 pumping machines.\n\nAlso, the statement revealed that an IRS at Asugbo creek in Warri was discovered with six ovens, 12 metal storage tanks and five large pits all containing about 600,000 litres of stolen crude oil including 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 150,000 litres of sludge.\n\nSimilarly, sequel to series of air reconnaissance, Forward Operating Base (FOB) FORMOSO in Bayelsa State on April 19, 2022, raided an IRS at Ereweibio creek in Brass LGA.\n\nAccordingly, seven large cooking ovens, 10 large metal storage tanks and drums all laden with about 400,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and 20,000 litres of suspected illegally refined PMS were discovered.\n\nThe site also had five large pits holding approximately 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil. Equally, two pumping machines, one gasoline generator, one submersible pump and one chainsaw machine were discovered at the site and destroyed in situ.\n\nAccording to the statement, on April 21, 2022, an IRS at Lelemu creek in Warri South-West was discovered. During the operation, 19 ovens, 26 metal storage tanks and two dugout pits laden with about 250,000 litres of suspected stolen crude oil and 50,000 litres of illegally refined AGO were destroyed.\n\nTo ensure effective deactivation of IRS, NNS DELTA on 21 April 2022 conducted swamp buggy operations during which an earlier identified IRS around Egwa creek in Warri was destroyed.\n\nDuring the operation, 16 ovens, 31 metal storage tanks and seven large pits all filled with about 850,000 litres of stolen crude oil were equally deactivated.\n\nRelatedly, on 22 April 2022, around Lelemu creek in Warri South West LGA of Delta State, personnel under NNS DELTA again discovered 22 IRS ovens, 12 metallic storage tanks and 5 large pits all containing about 150,000 litres of stolen crude oil.\n\n\u201cAt another IRS off Lelemu creek, 19 ovens, 42 storage tanks and 14 large pits containing about 300,000 litres of stolen crude oil, as well as approximately 200,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, 100,000 litres of illegally refined DPK and 100,000 litres of suspected crude oil sludge were all destroyed,\u201d it added.\n\nIn a related development, NNS LUGARD at Kogi State in the course of OPDDB discovered an IRS on 22 April 2022, at a location off Akili-Ozizor community of Ogbaru LGA, Anambra State.\n\nDuring the operation, four locally fabricated ovens, seven metal storage tanks, four large pits of which two were for storage of about 48,000 litres of stolen crude oil were all destroyed.\n\nOn the same day, NNS VICTORY in Calabar raided tanker garage along Harbour road in the city and seized a storage tank containing about 45,000 Litres of suspected illegally refined AGO. Also, a tanker laden with 33,000 Litres of suspected locally refined AGO was seized and the owner was arrested. Furthermore, about 58 drums of locally refined AGO were also seized.\n\nAdditionally, NNS SOROH at Yenagoa, on Saturday 23 April 2022 intercepted a wooden boat at Otuokpot Area along Kolo creek.\n\n\u201cThe wooden boat was laden with 60,000Litres of illegally refined AGO together with over 100 sacks of same product. Items on the boat which included one pumping machine, one Yamaha 40HP outboard engine and one locally made boat Anchor with the products were destroyed at Ogbia waterside,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe base also conducted a search on a Market Boat heading for St Nicolas Axis from Akassa area.\n\nAbout 2,500 litres of suspected illegally refined products stored in gallons and sacks were hidden inside the boat. Accordingly, same were evacuated for destruction. Likewise on the same day, personnel under NNS DELTA on patrol around Jones creek in Warri South West LGA raided an IRS and discovered 33 ovens, 42 metal storage tanks and seven wide pits all filled with about 1,200,000 litres of stolen crude oil, 250,000 litres of illegally refined AGO and about 100,000 litres of sludge.\n\nFurthermore, combing of the area off Jones creek led to the discovery of another IRS with five ovens, two metal storage tanks and eight large pits with about 150,000 litres of sludge. Both IRS off Jones creek with the discovered items and products were destroyed in situ.\n\nThe statement affirmed that over 6,000,000 litres of products valued over N3 billion from oil thieves and economic saboteurs.\n\n\u201cThe migration by operators of IRS from the South South geopolitical zone to the South East also come to the fore. \u201cThis development will in no way deter the Nigerian Navy from ensuring zero tolerance for COT, IRS, illegal bunkering and related economic crimes in the Nation\u2019s maritime environment and adjoining territory\u201d, it said.\n\nBuhari Mourns Over 100 Persons Killed in Imo Illegal Refinery Explosion, Says It\u2019s National Disaster\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Mr. Garba Shehu, Buhari, who described the unfortunate incident that occurred in Ohaji/Egbema of Imo State as a, \u201ccatastrophe and a national disaster,\u201d called on the security agencies to intensify their clampdown on oil theft.\n\nMany people were reportedly burnt beyond recognition by the explosion. It was learnt that the police were now looking for the owner of the unlawful refinery.\n\nDozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire.\n\nThe death toll continued to rise as emergency workers went through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) told the British media organisation, BBC Igbo, that the number killed now stood at 109.\n\n\u201cWe learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,\u201d Nnaji said.\n\nWhile offering his condolences to the families of the victims, the president demanded that those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice.\n\nIn the statement, titled, \u201cImo \u2018Refinery\u2019 Deaths, a National Disaster,\u201d Buhari urged community leaders and the security personnel in the area to prevent a reoccurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has directed the nation\u2019s armed forces, security and intelligence agencies to intensify the clampdown on illegal refineries following the reported deaths of tens of people Friday night after an illegal refinery exploded at Abaezi forest in the Ohaji-Egbema Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n\u201cReacting to what he described as a catastrophe and a national disaster, Buhari said responsibility for the loss of lives and property must squarely lie with the sponsors of the illegal refinery, who must all be caught and made to face justice.\n\n\u201cIn conveying the condolences and the full depth and range of the nation\u2019s shock and trauma to the families of the victims, the Ohaji/Egbema community and the government and people of Imo State, the president urged community leaders, the police, and the secret service to never allow the occurrence of the heart-breaking incident in any part of the country again.\u201d\n\nThe damage to fishing and farming in oil-rich communities caused by the oil industry over the decades has led some to find other ways to make money from the oil business. Illegal refining is attractive in some oil-producing communities, as it is seen as somewhat easy to manage, despite efforts to halt the practice.\n\nThe authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries.\n\nIt is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened overnight into Saturday, but accidents like this have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced.\n\nThere have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. But Nigeria\u2019s official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country, and making the unlawful business very lucrative.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Tambuwal: Tell us who the elders are, \u2026we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible\n\n*Saraki: It\u2019s a welcome development, painstaking efforts\n\n*Mohammed commends IBB, says recommendation not an imposition\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauch\n\nThe ripples generated by the consensus report of some northern elders, which endorsed former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and the Bauchi State governor as the preferred Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) northern presidential candidates, assumed another dimension yesterday after the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), umbrella body for the northern establishment, dissociated itself from the initiative with an effort to correct certain misgivings.\n\nThis is as some of those concerned have also continued to state their own accounts of what happened, while the others, defended and justified the report, authored by Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nWhile, the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who had maintained a rebellious stance since inception, queried who the northern elders commissioned General Ibrahim Babangida were, Saraki, on his part, commended the report, stating it was a thorough and painstaking efforts that ought to be commended by all.\n\nMohammed too commended the former military president and explained that the report was not an imposition.\n\nOn the contrary, a group known as the United Arewa Youth For Justice and Development, has thrown its weight behind the decision of the northern elders over the endorsement of Mohammed and Saraki as northern presidential consensus candidates of the PDP ahead of the 2023, presidential primaries of the party.\n\nHowever, NEF, in a statement by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the forum was not involved in the process as a body, it further insisted it was not affiliated to any political party or aspirant as it were, adding that the idea to engineer a consensus among the aspirants was that of the aspirants themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make clear that the entire process did not involve the Northern Elders Forum as a group, and is not a product of the group. It has become necessary to address the impression created in part by mischief, and in part by genuine confusion over the role of the Convener of Northern Elders Forum, in the efforts to create consensus among four aspirants for the Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\n\u201cNorthern Elders Forum is not affiliated to any political party or aspirant, and is strongly committed to the creation of a level playing field, which will allow the emergence of the best leaders in the 2023 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe forum stated that, it has also remained consistent in its conviction that all parts of the country should play their parts freely, unhindered by restrictions, which offend principles of inclusion and fairness, adding that, the North has excellent candidates whose fate should be left to party delegates and voters to decide.\n\nIt further maintained that it remained united behind the protection and projection of interests of the North and Nigeria, and would play its role as it has always done whenever the circumstances demanded.\n\nTambuwal, speaking with newsmen, queried the report saying, \u201cTell us who are the elders that sat down to come up with that decision? Who are the people that gave advice to reach that conclusion? Nobody has this information.\n\n\u201cI consulted the party leadership across the country especially, the Northern PDP leaders but no one is aware what\u2019s going on, indicating that something fishy is going on. If not, we are the ones that took ourselves to them to help the process, and later withdrew, why should anyone insist the process of consensus must continue?\n\n\u201cSo, based on this, I didn\u2019t go to Minna, and the decision that the two people are the Northern consensus candidate doesn\u2019t in anyway reflect my wish, and should therefore not worry my supporters. I am not involved in any of such. I am still in the race, I am seeking victory from GOD and in his mercy, God will give me,\u201d he stated.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cWe discussed the possibility of agreeing on one candidate within our group to represent us (Initially not even to represent the whole North) and we all agreed based on the situation of the party.\n\n\u201cWe started consultations based on that, and the fourth person that joined us is also another presidential aspirant Mohammad Hayatou-deen. In order for people not to perceive that may be we are trying to fight the candidacy of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, we also went to consult him and seek his blessings.\n\n\u201cHe was happy about it but he didn\u2019t show any interest to join us. That was how we continued our consultations. Along the line, we discussed that we really need an elder in the country, who will help us reach our goal amicably in case we may encounter any disagreement along the line within ourselves and we all agreed that we should take the matter to former president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida in Minna.\n\n\u201cWe explained to him and he immediately agreed. He was very happy. And he promised to do his best to help us achieve our mission. However, we had to at a point tell ourselves the truth. The four of us met in Bauchi State government diplomatic House in Abuja on Wednesday, we looked into the issue from all angles and we made it clear that consensus candidate is not feasible and we cannot continue the process, everyone should embark on independent struggle, and whosoever GOD gives the ticket to, its ok.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that senator Bukola Saraki will organise a press conference and inform the public about the outcome. Without consulting us, Bukola Saraki on his own sent us message that we need to go to Minna and see Babangida after all that wasn\u2019t part of what we agreed upon in our meeting. I communicated with Governor of Bauchi Bala Mohammed whether he received same message which he did.\n\n\u201cWe went and met Bukola Saraki. But at that point, I made it categorically clear to them that for the sake of GOD, that we didn\u2019t agree on that; our agreement was that consensus candidate isn\u2019t possible, why should we go and suffer that old man again?\n\n\u201cAnd that I will not go to Minna. Why should they be in a hurry. It isn\u2019t something urgent. Reconciliation and consensus arrangement can be achieved even lately on the elections ground on the day of election. Why the hurry? Our initial plan was to expand our consultations and make the consensus candidate even at national level before we realised that it isn\u2019t possible, even in our group let alone be at national level.\n\n\u201cBut they insisted we have to go to Minna and discuss the issue with Babangida. They were so in a hurry. And to our surprise, the consensus they agreed on yielded two candidates, the two of them not even one. That\u2019s an indication something fishy is going on, and I understand that already. Go and ask the three of them. We met on Wednesday and we agreed to bury the issue of consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cHow come Babangida and the Northern elders he invited would impose it on us after all we took ourselves to him, and we later withdrew,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut Saraki, through his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyanu, described the report of the consensus as thorough and painstaking in reaching the decision.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cIt is a welcome development. The process that eventually led to this decision cannot be faulted. It was painstaking, thorough and transparent. One needs to commend and appreciate the elders, who worked to actualise the process.\n\n\u201cMay Allah bless them all. Their decision was based on equity, justice, and need for inclusion of all. Yes, one consensus candidate has not emerged but they have initiated a process, which can help the party later on. The process is a work-in-progress.\n\n\u201cOne person will still emerge from the on-going process here in the North. The South also has an example to emulate in deciding on the aspirants that should proceed to the primaries considering the zones that have not produced a President before like the South East.\n\n\u201cA nation like Nigeria with all the current problems needs consensus building as a way of healing the nation and enlarging grounds of co-operation, unity and understanding,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nMohammed, in a statement by his campaign spokesperson, Prof Udenta Udenta, said, \u201cOn Wednesday 20th April, 2022 Gen. Ibrahim Babangida GCFR, through the channel of the platform he inaugurated, announced Senator Bala Mohammed and Senator Bukola Saraki as the selected Consensus Aspirants.\n\n\u201cThe Senator Bala Mohammed Presidential Campaign Organisation will thus like to place on record its eternal gratitude to President Ibrahim Babangida, GCFR and the entirety of Northern Elders, who assisted him in reaching this decision.\n\n\u201cOur deep appreciation to them stems less from the fact that Senator Mohammed is among the two selected consensus aspirants and more on their Labour of thankless patriotic duty and uncommon leadership in attempting to bring order and coherence to bear in a condition of acute political uncertainty and fractured political process. We thank you our leaders from the depth of our heart.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place it on record that Gen. Babangida never approached or lobbied anybody to superintend the process that will lead to the emergence of a Consensus Presidential Aspirant. Rather, it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Senator Bala Mohammed, RT Hon Aminu Tambuwal. Senator Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely and willingly approached Gen Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a Consensus Presidential Aspirant.\n\n\u201cThe above four named individuals not only initiated the Consensus Arrangement on their own volition but also agreed to fully and unequivocally abide by the decision that Gen Babangida will arrive at in consultation with other elders as well as accept, honour the steps and procedures he will deploy in arriving at any decision.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, reject the current insinuations in the media from some quarters that purport that Gen Babangida and the elders either did not consult very widely or imposed a decision on an unwilling band of presidential aspirants. Gen Babangida and elders deserve nothing but commendation for the conclusions they reached and the outcome of the Consensus exercise by anybody, who believes in the tenets of truth, honour and integrity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the northern elders are scheduled to meet today in Asokoro, Abuja, to deliberate on the consensus report and the Wednesday planned NEC meeting of the PDP,\n\nBut the Arewa Youth, in a press statement by Suleiman Abubakar, the Director, Public Affairs, stated: \u201cAs we embark on the second phase of this critical assignment, the two aspirants chosen by our elders should work together with the support of other major stakeholders and decide on which of them should emerge as the sole consensus PDP northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe criteria used by the elders, revealed that the North-East in terms of zonal assessment have been considered as Governor Bala Mohammed was not the only individual from the zone, hence factors of equity, Justice and fairness should not be ignored in any attempt as we continue on this historic efforts.\n\n\u201cTo this end, with Bala Mohammed as northern consensus candidate, the rest of Nigerians will understand that as northerners, we have done justice to ourselves as Bala is a detribalised leader, who has been tested and trusted as former minister of the federal capital territory, an achiever per excellence as an incumbent governor of Bauchi state.\n\n\u201cThe commitment of readiness demonstrated by his Excellency, Bala Mohammed, since his endorsement by our elders to lead discussion with all other aspirants in the PDP with a view to having a national consensus if possible, is encouraging and this tells us that he is the man for the job, if we truly want to succeed,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ayo Adebanjo, Afenifere leader, says he warned the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, not to put his trust in President Buhari as the latter would never support his 2023 presidency ambition.\n\nAdebanjo said this on Monday in his remarks at the \u201cGreater Nigeria Conference\u201d organised by the Nzuko Nmunna, an Igbo think-tank.\n\nThe focus of discussions at the conference was on the need to support a candidate from the South East in the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to Adebanjo, it is the turn of the South-East to produce the next president in the interest of fairness and equity.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe all know the truth. They don\u2019t want the South-East. It is not because they don\u2019t know what is right. I only like to point to the fact that they are just deceiving you. All you are hearing, that they (the North) are supporting the South-West is an element of deceit to deprive you, to be able to rule you. They don\u2019t like anybody.\n\n\u201cI told Tinubu himself, not in the papers, face-to-face. \u2018You believe this man (Buhari) will make you President?\u2019 He said \u2018yes\u2019. I said \u2018he wants to make you President and yet he asked (Yemi) Osinbajo to contest? He asked (Kayode) Fayemi to contest, he asked Amosun (Ibikunle) to contest?\u2019 All in the West, why? He wants to divide the West first.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is that President Goodluck Jonathan allowed himself to be disgraced by mentioning the fact that \u2018I am considering whether to be president or not. For what?\n\n\u201cNow that it is the turn of the South-East, they are propounding a new theory, it must be based on merit and all that. If it is the question of merit, who in the North qualifies to lead Nigeria? If it has been based on merit, the East alone would produce the President.\n\n\u201cI am saying all these because of the talks about \u2018go and sell yourself, go and campaign, go and lobby\u2019, it is all rigmarole. They know the truth.\n\n\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t like all the people that came out from the East, for the fact that they are saying you have no people, I am happy you have demonstrated that you have people. But go and unite. A house divided against itself will not stand. The North doesn\u2019t want to leave power. While the South is slugging it out, they put their candidate up.\u201d",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Twitter has accepted Elon Musk\u2019s offer to purchase the company for roughly $44 billion. The social media platform disclosed in a press release today that Musk purchased the company at $54.20 a share, the same price named in his initial offer on April 14, 2022.\n\nBret Taylor, Twitter\u2019s Independent Board Chair, said in the press release that the board had \u201cconducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon\u2019s proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter\u2019s stockholders,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nWhen Musk, the world\u2019s richest man with a net worth of $219 billion, made his initial offer, Twitter\u2019s board created a poison pill, a defense tactic used by a target company to prevent or discourage a potential hostile takeover, hinting that it would reject Musk\u2019s offer. News of today\u2019s acceptance shows that the board has changed its stance.\n\nOn April 21, Musk shared with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that he planned to finance the purchase by securing $25.5 billion of debt and about $21 billion equity commitment.\n\n\u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,\u201d Musk said in the statement announcing the acquisition.\n\nHe also hinted at upcoming changes he might implement at the company, adding that he wants to \u201cmake Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what impact Musk will ultimately have on Twitter, where he\u2019ll start making his proposed changes, or when. He\u2019s recently taken to using the platform to poll users about the creation of an edit button, for example, which Twitter had already been developing at the time. In the initial SEC filing, Musk expressed his plan to take the company private. He also shared during a recent TED interview that he wants to make the Twitter algorithm open-sourced, allowing people around the world to make suggestions and notice changes made to tweets.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s CEO, appeared to support the move, saying in the press release that \u201cTwitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.\u201d\n\nReacting to the news, Twitter users didn\u2019t hesitate to jump on the platform to share their predictions, concerns, and of course, hot takes on the matter.\n\nLet\u2019s see how the new owner of Twitter deal with fake accounts, spam bots and authenticating all human beings of this platform. The hacking of democracy using these digital platforms is another huge problem as well as access by subaltern groups and not just elites pic.twitter.com/KzpY4XMd4s \u2014 Pedzisai Ruhanya (@PedzisaiRuhanya) April 25, 2022\n\n#BREAKING African billionaire, Elon Musk, buys US social media network, Twitter, in bid to help the troubled, disease-ravaged, gun-ridden banana-exporting republic which is struggling to recover from deadly ethnic violence following disputed, shambolic 2020 presidential election. \u2014 gathara (@gathara) April 25, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies hire smart people to help improve how their customers perceive and interact with their products, and Justin Irabor is one of such people. One interesting thing about him is that he has provided value through various channels over the years. If Justin Irabor doesn\u2019t ring a bell, his aliases, Mogwai and TheVunderkind, should.\n\n\u201cI have been many things. It depends on the timeframe I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he begins.\n\nJustin has consistently demonstrated his belief that being exceptional at one thing is not good enough.\n\nIn one of his Substack blog posts, he quoted science fiction author, Robert A Heinlein\u2019s infamous words, \u201cSpecialization is for insects,\u201d not really in praise of self-sufficiency, but rather in the context of mastering one\u2019s craft. Ironically, you would have to move on to the next when that is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin is driven by the philosophy of not being ruled by a scarcity mindset, and it appears that once he has \u201cslain his dragons,\u201d as he puts it, in a particular field, he\u2019s ready for a new exploit.\n\n\u201cLet things go if they are inconvenient for you, more things will come!\u201d\n\nFlipping the pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin describes his career start as \u201ca classical spreadsheet monkey,\u201d working on an eCommerce product as a content executive. Between 2015 and 2021, he was editor-in-chief at a PR company, regional marketing manager for Jumia Food, and head of content and marketing at Hotels.ng.\n\nHe also tried his hands out as the product manager and editor-in-chief for Big Cabal and Zikoko. Later, he took up the opportunity to set up the digital marketing department for Eden Life.\n\nMogwai\u2019s past roles constantly saw him draw upon his superb ability to write convincingly and analyse outcomes and predictions \u2014 skills needed by a marketer and growth specialist. While in these positions, he built confidence and slowly transitioned from the shy person he once was.\n\nIn the past seven years, in contrast to the number of times Justin has granted interviews, he prefers instead to publicise his thoughts through texts and illustrations on different platforms, some of which I was able to track: two Substack blogs \u2014 do while thinking and Craft overflow \u2014 a very active Twitter account, a GitHub repository, a website, and a LinkedIn account.\n\nFun fact: Justin sends between 50 and 80 tweets on a good day. From one-liner quoted retweets to full-blown tweet threads to images with ALT text. If he isn\u2019t talking comics, it\u2019s a show (recently animated series, Archer), NFT, Metaverse, Web3, or songs.\n\nJustin is also an artist and illustrator who makes comics to pass the time. Despite all that he does, Mogwai does not let his works alone speak for themselves; he consistently shares his journey. That I got interested in his story is proof that this strategy works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarketing, for him, means convincing people and not spending a lot of money while at it.\n\nJustin\u2019s somewhat ironic background saw him having to speak to people despite how shy he was. As a young boy, he gained some sales experience and has grown to work as a digital marketer, content creator, and growth expert.\n\nSpeaking about his experience transitioning across companies and industries, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful; it\u2019s very distressful even. Half the time, you\u2019re gonna be thinking, \u2018Ah! I made a mistake. I should just stay with the thing I\u2019m comfortable in.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nHowever, despite the challenges and doubts about new ventures, he finds that he is fulfilled at the end of the day.\n\nTransitioning to software engineering\n\nLet\u2019s begin with an excerpt from Justin\u2019s LinkedIn bio \u2014 \u201cI come from a background in digital marketing and growth, and that instinct makes me a software engineer who builds products with considerations for the end-user by default.\u201d\n\nI should probably reveal that his transition from digital marketing to software engineering was why I decided to meet Justin.\n\nWe meet at his place. He sits across from me, a table between us, in a sitting room with several strategically placed framed works of art belonging to his flatmate. Donning a pair of grey joggers with a matching T-shirt, he greets me with a warm smile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a conversation with Justin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nSoftware engineering called out to him when he was editor-in-chief at a startup, and every downtime had to be escalated to the technical team.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t act on this pull until 2019, when it was clear he needed to change direction. Two years earlier, he thought it was impractical for him to do it along with his job, but he did it nonetheless while still at Eden Life.\n\nA little back story here. By the time Justin had spent four years in marketing and growth, he knew it was time for a change. He was not entirely excited by where his career trajectory might take him \u2014 probably peaking at a C-level executive role and being responsible for a global company\u2019s continental growth.\n\n\u201cMoney is good, but it doesn\u2019t excite me; I am driven by a purely intellectual pursuit. This means that beyond a point, I began to feel like, \u2018Oh! d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! I\u2019ve done all of these before.\u2019 Everything is the same thing but in a different context. It\u2019s like, when you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. The only thing I could do was start to switch industries.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something that felt like when you get on a treadmill; you can\u2019t get off. Once you\u2019re a software engineer, and specifically, computer scientist \u2014 that\u2019s what I wanna be \u2014 your learning is infinite,\u201d he lets out an excited laugh with a lit-up face, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna know some things, but you ain\u2019t gonna know everything till you die.\u201d\n\nI recognise this demeanour anywhere; it could only mean that Mogwai had hit gold and found the perfect escape in software engineering.\n\nIn 2019, Lambda School, a California-based online coding school, opened its doors to students from Africa, and Justin was part of the cohort in that pilot phase. The full-stack developer education programme did not strain his finances since it was a school-now-pay-later arrangement. However, the challenging part was the commitment it required.\n\nJustin describes his daily regimen.\n\n\u201cFor 11 months at a go, every single day, I was writing code. Every single day, I was building a project. This was how I worked it. I attended classes from 8 to 10 a.m. before going to work at Eden till evening.\u201d\n\nOne of the most significant sacrifices he made was putting in extra hours at work to make up for time lost in the mornings. He\u2019d get home in the evenings and take a nap before waking up at 10 p.m. to work on meeting his learning expectation \u2014 to build products after every class.\n\nThe sacrifices paid off, and he\u2019s worked for two foreign companies in under two years.\n\n\u201cI graduated, and I got a job working for a designing agency in the UK called Series Eight. Did a few months there, and then I got a job at a fintech company in Belgrade, Serbia. I\u2019m a full-stack engineer there. So, I work on the backend APIs and customer-facing administrative data board.\u201d\n\nA year as a software engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nAlthough Justin was sure about transitioning into software engineering, he didn\u2019t escape the frustration that came with the move.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I finished Lambda School, it was difficult to get a job as a software engineer.\u201d\n\nHe speaks about a period when he did not have a job. It lasted much longer than he thought and gradually depleted his savings. It took a lot of self-restraint not to pick up a marketing role or accept an offer from a Nigerian company \u2014 which he had initially decided against for some reasons.\n\nBut, in the face of challenges, he spurred himself on by repeatedly asking, \u201cHow badly do I want it?\u201d\n\nHis current job is at TradeCore, a fintech API company, where he\u2019s the only full-stack engineer on the team. He considers his craft as something very intellectually satisfying.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m building, I\u2019m nourished by the things I learn.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the appeal he gets from computer science is how difficult it can get sometimes.\n\nHe takes his time simplifying what programming is to me, but I can\u2019t deny it will take more convincing to agree that it is not more complex than he\u2019s making it. He can probably guess that from my look but still encourages me to try it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but it\u2019s not as difficult as people tend to think because you only have to understand the context. Programming is the purest expression of creativity which means if you\u2019re a creative, you should want to be a programmer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Justin\u2019s new obsession is all over his public-facing platforms.\n\n\u201cAnd lately, I have interest in Web3. So, I do a bunch of Web3 projects; I work on a bunch of DAOs, and I do some dev relations for Web3 products.\u201d\n\nJustin carries himself with the air of a seasoned software engineer, and you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking he has been in the space for longer. He attributes this to many things he picked up while working in marketing. It is safe to say that he\u2019s proud of his growth.\n\n\u201cI manage myself. I come into meetings and ask questions like I\u2019m a senior engineer. I take responsibility. I learnt that working in the hospitality space.\u201d\n\nMaking Justin proud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Irabor. Full-stack engineer, TradeCore\n\nJustin takes pride in being a voracious learner choosing to expose himself \u201cto the trauma of ignorance every day.\u201d Once he discovers a problem, he finds a fix by getting books and tutorials.\n\nAnother smart move is documenting his journey to get a graph of his progress.\n\n\u201cI have something called \u2018Thinkboy\u2019, a note archive which is only for software engineering stuff. I create a folder for the month. I\u2019ve archived the one for 2021.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s committed to building apps even if they don\u2019t get deployed.\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of how an average looks for him. He wakes up at 9:05 a.m., has a stand-up meeting at 10 a.m. to share progress on the previous day\u2019s tasks, and plans for the day. He typically spends the rest of the day on peer programming, debugging, responding to emails, writing code, and making deployments.\n\nHaving recorded a few high and low points, Justin considers Angels Among Us \u2014 a project he worked on during the lockdown in 2020 \u2014 as his proudest achievement. Angels Among Us was deployed a month before he graduated from Lambda School. He describes it as an app for people with relatively secure financial statuses to help a randomly-generated list of people who have been economically affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nIn a short time, it attracted several donations and volunteers to put smiles on the faces of several families after raising around \u20a64 million (~$10,000). And, of course, it was only a matter of time before it got the attention of international press platforms like Quartz and Reuters.\n\nDespite the stress that came with it, Justin accomplished his goal of making something purely altruistic. And he plans to do more of such.\n\nAlthough he can\u2019t put a number to the projects he\u2019s built, his most recent is Catalogue, a free NFT minting tool for people with no basic NFT knowledge. He also built Astrofy, an app that generates a horoscope-based Spotify playlist. There are also close to ten other software projects, one of which was runner-up at the BuyCoin fintech Hackathon.\n\nIf things go according to Justin\u2019s plans, he will build a startup in the next three to five years. But if that does not happen, he has the vision to improve on Angels Among Us and create a verifiable database of people who need help across Africa.\n\nIf it does take off, it will create a consistent help channel for people who need it. Say, an amount dedicated to a child\u2019s schooling annually. For him, this would have a long-term impact and cause a dent in the continent\u2019s institutional poverty.\n\nIf Justin is not working, he\u2019s illustrating. In a different life, he would be a filmmaker. If Justin could speak to the whole world at once, he\u2019d say, \u201cYou should be more willing to interrogate established wisdom.\u201d\n\nFun fact: There\u2019s a story for one of Justin\u2019s aliases, Mogwai. A quick Google search tells you it means \u201cevil spirit\u201d or \u201cdevil\u201d in Cantonese. Weird, yes? But Justin says his choice of Mogwai is to remind him to always take responsibility if he wants the best results. Side note: Mogwai used to be a cute pet.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know Elon Musk, the richest man in the world \u2014 according to Forbes \u2014 founded, co-founded, or currently leads Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Tesla Inc., and PayPal?\n\nNonetheless, I\u2019m curious why he, a frequent Twitter user, would wake up one morning and say to himself, \u201cI want to acquire Twitter.\u201d\n\nI was kidding. Maybe he didn\u2019t just wake up and say all of that. \ud83d\ude06 Remember when Musk wanted to launch a social media platform where users could write whatever they wanted? Some people did not want that but asked him to purchase Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, one of the reasons he wanted to buy the platform is that he believes Twitter needs to go private to grow and become a genuine free speech platform.\n\nAlso, he stated that he wants to combat trolls on Twitter and proposed changes to the Twitter Blue premium subscription service, such as lowering the price and banning advertising and adding Dogecoin as a payment option on Twitter.\n\nInterestingly, it appears he began considering the idea in 2017 when he declared his love for Twitter in a tweet. A Twitterer replying asked him to buy it, and Musk enquired about the price.\n\nWell, before we go to today\u2019s gist, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nElon Musk takes over Twitter\n\nVerifying credentials through blockchain\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions. Do you have a Web-based solution for Africa? Register for TABS Web3 Hackathon here.\n\nAlso, you can register for the event here.\n\nElon Musk takes over Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Twitter-Musk drama, which began with Tesla CEO, Elon Musk purchasing a 9.2 percent stake in Twitter, has seemingly ended.\n\nWhy? Twitter announced yesterday, April 25, 2022, that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity wholly owned by Musk for $54.20 per share in cash in an approximately $44 billion transaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, Twitter will become a privately held company after the transaction is completed.\n\nRecall that Twitter initially implemented a poison pill strategy that could thwart a takeover attempt by making it too expensive.\n\nRemember this? Who will take the poison pill? It appears Twitter has literally swallowed its poison pill by negotiating with Musk.\n\nPer The New York Times, Musk met with Twitter\u2019s board of directors in the early hours of Monday, April 25, 2022, to discuss his unsolicited bid to purchase the company.\n\nBut why\u2019d Twitter accept Musk\u2019s offer even with the poison pill in place? Unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, depending on who you ask \u2014 the company was under intense pressure from its shareholders to reach an agreement with Musk.\n\nThe Twitter board reportedly met on Sunday, April 24, 2022, to discuss Musk\u2019s offer after outlining a detailed financing plan for his bid on Thursday, April 21, 2022. The financing plan is believed to have changed the board\u2019s perception of Musk\u2019s $54.20 per share offer.\n\nRecall that Musk stated in a tweet that if his bid is successful, he will defeat spambots and authenticate all real humans.\n\nWill you continue to use the app now that the bid appears to be a done deal, even as we wait for the new Twitter owner to fulfill his promises? Please leave your comment in the comments section.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon. Get it directly in your inbox by subscribing to the Intelligence by Techpoint newsletter here.\n\nVerifying credentials through blockchain\n\nFake credentials have become a worldwide issue. Per the National Student Clearinghouse, a US NGO that provides a degree verification service, falsified academic credentials are a serious, prevalent, and ever-increasing problem.\n\nThere is also a growing concern in Africa about the proliferation of low-quality \u2014 if not entirely bogus \u2014 universities and colleges. For example, in Benin, a West African country, some unscrupulous Benin-based operators are preying on gullible Nigerians by offering them fake degrees, resulting in fake credentials.\n\nIn South Africa, the use of forged credentials is becoming more common. The number of fraudulent qualifications reported to regulatory bodies like the South African Qualifications Authority increased significantly in 2018.\n\nSo, to reduce the occurrences of fraud and fake documentation, South Africa believes that blockchain is the way forward. Consequently, the University of Johannesburg (UJ) announced that it would begin issuing blockchain-based certificates to students who graduate from the institute this year.\n\nWhat does this imply? UJ is leading the way in South African education by issuing degrees and other certifications that can be verified using blockchain technology.\n\nWhy? The authenticity of blockchain-based certificates makes certificate fraud virtually impossible, but it also allows anyone to check its authenticity by simply scanning a QR code printed on the certificate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the new blockchain-based certificates will not only protect the university\u2019s certificates from fraud but will also protect the institution\u2019s reputation and qualification integrity.\n\nWhile you\u2019re wondering how this would work, I believe you can guess what I will do next. Haha! I\u2019m not a blockchain enthusiast like Bolu. If this is your first or second time reading Techpoint Digest, Techpoint Africa\u2019s newsletter, I believe you should meet Bolu, our blockchain go-to person.\n\nBolu provided some interesting insights in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast. Please take a moment to listen to it here.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re still unsure about the blockchain concept or want to make a career out of it and don\u2019t know how to begin, I believe the Tecpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is for you. The event will take place on Saturday, May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a new week, and we are back with Tuesday\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast. Top on our list \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 is the Twitter sale.\n\nYesterday, April 25, 2022, Twitter\u2019s board of directors announced that it had agreed to be acquired by an entity owned by Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, at approximately $44 billion. If you\u2019ve been following this closely, then you also know that this means the microblogging platform is going private.\n\nI\u2019m not a capital markets expert, so I can\u2019t tell you if it was a good idea to hodl or not, but it seems all shareholders are getting money to the tune of $54.20 per share. Not a bad return, considering the price hovered around $50 to $52 until trading on Twitter stock was stopped due to the impending sale. Some interesting takes there.\n\nMoving on, after Emmanuel\u2019s journey to the launch site of Google\u2019s Equiano Internet cable, it turns out it isn\u2019t landing until Friday, April 29, 2022. It didn\u2019t stop us from writing about it or talking about it, however. It\u2019s not every day that a cable that promises to allow you to download a 1GB file in less than 2 minutes lands on your shores.\n\nThere was quite some dust to raise here, including when all that Internet will get to the hinterlands, where some might argue it is needed the most.\n\nFinally, Bolu, in his role as resident blockchain expert, discussed the University of Johannesburg\u2019s decision to begin issuing blockchain-based certificates to students to prevent fraud.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t yet know how they plan to carry out this plan, listening to Bolu\u2019s breakdown of how it could work out was quite instructive.\n\nThis nicely segues into the upcoming Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit holding on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton.

          "text": "2023 Election: I can only contest if I am endorsed by the President-Jonathan\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nGroups reject Jonathan\u2019s candidacy in APC\n\nAspirants looking for consensus are lazy \u2013 Tinubu group\n\nSupport groups working for some presidential aspirants of the party have rejected the consultation between former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and some leaders of the All Progressives Congress for Jonathan to emerge as the presidential candidate.\n\nGroups loyal to the APC National leader and former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; have terminated the consensus plot for the ex-President.\n\nOther members of the party in the presidential race include the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello and the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi.\n\nThe NIGERIAN OBSERVER gathered that Jonathan had informed some APC leaders that he would only join the presidential race if he was directly endorsed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nEarlier The NIGERIAN OBSERVER reported that Jonathan\u2019s posters flooded the national secretariat of the APC and some youth groups stormed Jonathan\u2019s office in the Maitama area of Abuja, calling on him to join the Presidential race.\n\nIn his response, the former President had told protesters that he could not say for sure if he would declare or not but only advised his supporters to \u201cwatch out.\u201d\n\nA member of the APC National Executive Committee who pleaded anonymity said all presidential aspirants were aware of the plan to bring Jonathan in as the consensus candidate.\n\nHowever, he said that members of the Presidency cabal who were working on the plan were not sure whether it would succeed.\n\nThe party chieftain stated, \u201cI can tell you they are facing a tough task as far as Jonathan is concerned. Although from his body language, one can see that Jonathan is interested. However, his backers in the APC are confused about how to launder the public image of Jonathan whom they painted incompetent and clueless in 2015.\n\n\u201cAnother tough task the party may face is how it will convince other aspirants like Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amaechi, Umahi and Bello to step down. Many members are not happy with the plot and are ready to shoot it down.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Leader, Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation, Ekiti State, Femi Adeleye, said on Sunday that the party could not give Jonathan a waiver to contest the presidential election as a consensus candidate when there were competent and capable aspirants already.\n\nAdeleye who said the presidential aspirants were already preparing for an indirect primary, however, said the party would adopt Osinbajo in case it considered a consensus arrangement.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEven at that, if all the contestants agree within themselves and decide to step down for one of them, I am very comfortable that our principal, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, will be the one they will step down for. I am very comfortable with that.\n\n\u201cIf some people are rooting for Jonathan, the party must accept him first. And for him to contest, he must have spent a year in the party and our primary will hold in the one month\u2019s time. It will be very difficult for the party to say they want to give him a waiver and pick him as consensus candidate when there are competent hands already on the ground.\u201d\n\nIn a swift response, the South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 known as SWAGA 2023, said that there was no possibility of a consensus presidential candidate in the upcoming primary election.\n\nThe Chairman of SWAGA 2023, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, said, \u201cThe candidates for the presidential election await the primaries and the people will have to earn it. Don\u2019t forget that under the new electoral law, you can only have consensus when all the candidates or aspirants have agreed in writing and I don\u2019t see that happening. Those who are looking for consensus are the lazy ones who have not done any work.\n\n\u201cWe are working and hoping to have free and fair primaries which I know that by the grace of the almighty God, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will easily win. So, the issue of consensus candidacy should be forgotten completely. Nobody will impose the president on Nigeria, the party members will choose their candidates by themselves at the convention and the Nigerian people will be given the opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice in February next year.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye said the Presidential primary would not be like the national convention of March 26 because the primary is more complicated as it would involve a wider electorate.\n\nThe leader of the Grassroot Network for Asiwaju Tinubu group, Mr Abiodun Mafe, also said that Jonathan was not known to be a member of the APC hence he could not be the presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cJonathan has never been a member of the APC, so how will it be possible for anyone to say that he will be made a consensus candidate? Until he now proves to the whole world that he is a card-carrying member of the APC, it can\u2019t be. Even at that, there is a process. Constitutionally, anybody who is a member of the APC has the right to contest but as far as I am concerned Jonathan is not a part,\u201d Mafe stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

When they are gone, we expect that you should continue to come to the centres where you got care to follow up.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian professionals who are working with them are going to continue to be here; come for your follow-ups.

He was, however, ignored on the commandant\u2019s directive.\n\n\u201cHowever, rather than go his way, the police officer, unknown to the the men of the Corps, put a call through to his colleagues, who mobilised to the command\u2019s headquarters, while he followed the entourage to Owerri.\n\n\u201cOn reaching the Corps office, while the commandant made to enter the command, the man blocked the NSCDC boss, brought out a pistol and announced that he was a police officer. On sighting that, he was immediately rounded up and arrested by NSCDC officers who also seized the pistol to avert danger.\u201d\n\nAnother officer, who did not want his name in print, said, \u201cAfter he was released, he returned with heavily armed enraged MOPOL men who went into beating, shooting and attacking both officers and their facilities at the premises.\u201d\n\nLeadership further learnt that in the process ensuing chaos, the commandant, Mr Ogar, who was already in his office, rushed out to address the situation on hearing the gunshots, but the enraged policemen attacked and beat him up with his uniform torn, after which he was stripped down to his boxers before being whisked away.\n\nIt was also gathered that the enraged MOPOL officers who threatened to shoot at the state commandant allegedly boasted that nothing will happen.\n\nThe civil defence source who spoke to the medium said the policemen subsequently released their colleague who was arrested and detained for invading its premises.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, efforts to get spokespersons of both security agencies to react to the show of shame proved abortive as they did not respond to calls put across to their phone lines.",

The only way to go for peace to reign is to allow Tricycles Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria under its leaders to manage its operations as was the case before\u201d, Adeoti said.\n\nAs at the time of filing in this report, protests were ongoing in Ile Epo, Abule \u1eb8gba and Ekoro.\n\nIt was learnt that under Alhaji Abiola Istijabah, there was nothing like multiple ticketing.\n\n\u201cIn the old order, many a time we would approach Alhaji Istijabah for help concerning our children school fees, and he would gladly do so.

          "text": "Farmers in Nigeria have commended input and market linkage interventions of the CBN, calling on the Federal Government to spread the coverage of the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) to every state of the country following good results in rice and maize production.\n\nAlthough the country is said to be deficient in the two commodities, production have increased significantly through the ABP.\n\nThe farmers lamented that seeds, fertiliser and other inputs for food crop production have become too expensive, and escalating assistance to them through the ABP scheme is not only desirable but also expedient for the country.\n\nThe umbrella body of various commodity associations in Nigeria, the All Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigeria (AFAN), said without deepening various existing funding systems and intervention programmes of the apex bank, improved seeds, fertiliser and other agro-chemicals that would help farmers to produce adequate quantity of food would be a mirage.\n\nLinking more off-takers, financial institutions and insurers to empower more farmers with inputs and finances with pre-agreed buy-back prices should be spread to every state, the association disclosed.\n\n\u201cWithout such assistance, most farmers, due to financial constraints, would only recycle grains as seeds, avoid use of fertiliser and agro-chemicals and would do manual tillage, planting and weeding with resultant poor yields,\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently disclosed that it would finance the cultivation of 600,000 hectares of grains in the 2022 wet season farming.\n\nThe partnership between the CBN and Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN) through the ABP had produced a total of 300 metric tonnes in 2021, which were displayed in 12 pyramids and released to the market through allocations to food and agro-allied stakeholders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor of the bank, Godwin Emefilele, said: \u201cAs we prepare for another wet season programme, the Central Bank of Nigeria is committed to financing over 600,000 hectares. Our strategy is hinged on improving productivity by providing more funding for the anchors to enable them to utilise high quality inputs and good agronomic practices to boost output.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank has spent N864 billion on 4.1 million farmers cultivating 5.02 million hectares through the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) so far. The farmers include grain, cereal, cassava, cocoa, yam and sweet potato farmers, among others.\n\nAt the Rice Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) rice pyramids in Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari said the ABP had supported over 4.8 million small-scale farmers with planting inputs and market linkages that have boosted their means of livelihood and food production, saying, \u201cThe ABP has so far supported over 4.8 million smallholder farmers across Nigeria for the production of 23 agricultural commodities, including maize, rice, oil palm, cocoa, cotton, cassava, tomato, and livestock. Today, rice production in Nigeria has increased to over 7.5 million metric tonnes annually.\u201d\n\nNigeria produces about 12.0 million tonnes of maize, while yearly demand hovers around 20.0 million metric tonnes, fueling hike in price, and productivity of farmers has remained as low as 1.5 to 2.5 metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nA maize breeder at the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training, Prof. Samuel Olakojo, said improved seeds and new production technologies would boost productivity of farmers and ensure closing the production gap.\n\nHe also emphasised higher plant population per hectare to reduce empty spaces and weeding cost while boosting yield.\n\nHe added that in the face of financial constraints of smallholder farmers in the country, and unwillingness of financial institutions to advance loans to farmers individually, the ABP scheme of the Federal Government should be made more elaborate and all-encompassing so that more maize and other grain farmers could participate.",

          "title": "World Malaria Day: US pledges support as Nigeria ranks highest globally, loses 200,000 lives, spends N646bn annually to tackle scourge",
          "text": "Nigeria loses over $1.1 billion (N645.7 billion) yearly to prevention and treatment of malaria as well as other costs, just as no fewer than 200,000 Nigerians were killed by malaria with 61 million others afflicted in 2021.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) announced this figure Monday during the celebration of the World Malaria Day (WMD).\n\nApril 25 was set aside as World Malaria Day (WMD) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to raise awareness on the mosquito-borne disease and examine efforts towards prevention, treatment, control and elimination of the illness, which according to the body, led to 602,020 reported deaths in Africa last year.\n\nThe theme of WMD 2022 is \u2018Harness innovation to reduce the malaria disease burden and save lives.\u2019\n\nExperts also said Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), Tanzania and Mozambique accounted for over half of all malaria deaths globally.\n\nThey, however, said \u201cdespite the successes recorded with the new malaria vaccine, no single tool is available today that will solve the problem of malaria.\u201d\n\nThey noted that it would, therefore, take a combination of strategies, including use of existing control and preventive measures, as well as development of new tools, to control and ultimately eliminate malaria.\n\nWHO\u2019s call\n\nIn view of the prevalence, WHO has called \u201cfor investments and innovation that bring new vector control approaches, diagnostics, anti-malarial medicines and other tools to speed up the pace of progress against malaria.\u201d\n\nWHO said \u201cdespite steady advances in lowering the global burden of malaria between 2000 and 2015, progress has slowed or stalled in recent years, particularly in high burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nThe world body noted that urgent and concerted action was needed to set the world back on a trajectory toward achieving the 2030 targets of the global malaria strategy.\n\nAccording to WHO, about 95 per cent of the estimated 228 million cases last year occurred in Africa, along with 602,020 reported deaths.\n\nThe body also said \u201csix African countries, worst impacted by malaria, are reported to have accounted for up to 55 per cent of cases globally and for 50 per cent of these deaths. This is a reduction from the 241 million cases in 2020 and estimated deaths at 627,000.\u201d\n\nWHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, 0in her message to mark this year\u2019s WMD, said the theme aligns with calls to urgently scale up innovation and deployment of new tools in the fight against malaria, while advocating equitable access to malaria prevention and treatment, within the context of building health system resilience.\n\nMoeti further said the past year had witnessed significant breakthroughs in malaria prevention and control, despite of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cLandmark recommendations on the use of the first vaccine against malaria, RTS,S were released by WHO late last year.\n\n\u201cThis vaccine will be used to prevent malaria among children aged six months to five years, who live in moderate to high transmission settings,\u201d Moeti said.\n\nAccording to the latest World Malaria Report, \u201cfour African countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (31.9 per cent), Democratic Republic of the Congo (13.2 per cent), United Republic of Tanzania (4.1 per cent) and Mozambique (3.8 per cent). In 2019, there were 303 cases per 1,000 population at risk of malaria.\n\n\u201cNigeria accounts for about 31.9 per cent of the global malaria deaths; this is approximately 200,000 deaths in 2021. Over 60 million people are infected yearly and an estimated US$1.1 billion is lost yearly due to malaria related absenteeism and productivity losses.\u201d\n\nIn October 2021, WHO recommended the broad use of the RTS,S malaria vaccine for young children living in areas with moderate and high malaria transmission.\n\nThe recommendation was informed by results from an ongoing WHO-coordinated pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that has reached more than 900,000 children since 2019.\n\nEvidence and experience from the programme has shown that the vaccine is safe, feasible to deliver and reduces deadly severe malaria.\n\nRTS,S is an example of innovation at work and a scientific breakthrough \u2013 it is the first vaccine recommended for use against a human parasitic disease of any kind.\n\nUS pledges support\n\nMeanwhile, the United States of America has acknowledged its partnership with Nigeria to advance the fight against malaria, despite immense challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe U.S said committed and courageous frontline health workers, especially nurses, midwives, and community health workers, across the country went the extra mile to ensure essential malaria services were sustained.\n\nA statement Monday by the U.S. Embassy said efforts of the two countries saved lives and supported community resilience.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI) has partnered with Nigeria to fight malaria since 2011, contributing $768 million to date and $74 million in FY 2021.\n\n\u201cPMI\u2019s Annual Report, released today, showcases how the strong partnership between the United States and Nigeria enabled robust and effective malaria services to continue in FY 2021, even as COVID-19 caused enormous strain on the health system.\n\n\u201cThrough PMI funding and programs, 58 million bed nets, 130 million fast acting medicines, and 82 million malaria test kits have been delivered to clinics and communities since 2011.\n\n\u201cIn addition, 24 million preventive treatment doses were delivered to pregnant women and 13 million doses to children during the rainy season. In the past year, more than 3,666 health workers received training that amplified their ability to detect and treat malaria, while strengthening the health system overall and providing key skills to fight COVID-19 and future pandemics,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe statement further quoted the USAID Mission Director Anne Patterson as saying, \u201cI think what Nigeria is doing to advance more effective malaria prevention, treatment, and control is so important, especially the introduction of innovative tools to make better use of the data in real-time, and also to enhance quality of care via community-based health workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssisted by PMI investments, Nigeria is progressing its fight against malaria using proven and cost-effective methods that save lives and promise a more healthy and prosperous future for families and communities.\n\n\u201cActing U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator Julie Wallace said, \u201cWith perseverance and strong global commitment we can end malaria in our lifetime.

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) Monday told the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government to leave Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese Matthew Hassan Kukah out of the issues around delay in delivery of weapons from the western countries.\n\nRather, it said, the federal government should review its strategies in the war against insurgency and terrorism.\n\nNEF Director of Publicity and Advocacy Hakeem Baba-Ahmed stated this during a television interview on the African Independent Television, AIT, monitored by Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nBaba-Ahmed was speaking on the Presidency\u2019s decision to blame Kukah and opponents of government for the perception of the United States government of poor Christianity and Islam relations in Nigeria, believed to be responsible delayed supply of fighter jets to the country.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu had in a statement Sunday alleged that the cleric provided quotes to a new book written by former US Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, which the Presidency observed, was not likely to conclude that Nigeria has improved in any front.\n\nOn the delayed delivery of Tucano fighter jets to tackle the Boko Haram insurgency, the statement had said: \u201cIn 2015 the then newly-elected Buhari government requested US military support in the form of Super Tucano jet fighters for the Nigerian Air Force. The Nigerian military, security, and intelligence services repeatedly made this request.\n\n\u201cThe US administration of the time concurred: the delivery of such jets would help deliver a critical turning point in Nigeria\u2019s struggle against jihadist terrorists across the Sahel.\n\n\u201cYet two years later, that jet delivery was rescinded, the reasons given that unless Nigeria improved its religious relations between Christianity and Islam then US support would not be forthcoming in this, and many other areas.\n\n\u201cSuch views were compounded by the constant lobbying of US Congress by the opponents of the Nigerian government who had lost the previous election, and many of their southern religious supporters \u2013 including Bishop Mathew Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Diocese of Sokoto, who, unsurprising, provides a supportive quote for the dustcover of the new edition of Campbell\u2019s book. (Kukah even took to addressing the US Congress himself, briefing his audience on the history of coups in Nigeria\u2013without, of course, mentioning that none had occurred since 1993, some 29 years ago).\n\n\u201cFortunately, now today under a new US administration these jets have been delivered, and with it, a serious blow against the terrorists \u2013 with the supreme leader of Islamic State in West Africa and scores of other leaders of the group eliminated in airstrikes.\u201d\n\nNEF faults presidency\n\nFaulting the Presidency\u2019s position during the television interview, the NEF publicist said Nigeria had problem procuring weapons because of the conduct of the armed forces and related agencies on human rights issues, dealing with prisoners of war and people caught up in conflicts.\n\nBaba-Ahmed said: \u201cYou know, the presidency spokespersons have a way of deflecting criticism by making it personal. When you say that there is a shortfall in the quality of government, they find something to stick you with.\n\n\u201cPeople like Bishop Kukah and I, are used to this. We don\u2019t take it seriously. This, this organization should be criticized and must be criticized, and those who are ready to do so should be willing to take some of the words that Garba Shehu and Femi Adesina recycle every once in a while when we point out certain facts about the failings of President in terms of securing the country.\n\n\u201cBut the truth is, maybe they know this, maybe they don\u2019t know, Nigerian Government has problems procuring weaponry from Western countries, because these countries, in most cases have standards regarding conduct by their armed forces and related agencies, in terms of dealing on human rights issues, dealing with prisoners of war, dealing with populations caught up in conflicts.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows this. They will not sell you one bullet unless they are satisfied that you\u2019ve met certain criteria. And they have raised issues over and over and over again. The Nigerian government knows this. But they need to improve the conduct of the Nigerian military, in the fight against the insurgency, against terrorists. They know this.\n\n\u201cAnd when someone points them out, either it is because of lethargy, it takes them a long time to adjust, or perhaps the challenges of the conflict doesn\u2019t allow them to make adjustments while they\u2019re also fighting, I don\u2019t know what it is, but whatever it is, it is true that if we have met, or comply with standards, set by countries that should give us weapons, well, sell us weapons, we would have a lot more weapons that we have now.\n\n\u201cSo, whether it comes from Bishop Kukah, or it comes from me, we made this point. We want to buy weapons from some countries, improve the way we wage this war. It can be done; it must be done if you want these weapons.\n\n\u201cYou certainly don\u2019t want to go the option of some other members of the government who say procure weapons from anywhere in the world, or just bring in mercenaries to fight a war for you.\n\n\u201cSo, I agree with Bishop Kukah that the government needs to review its attitude, some of those issues raised by countries that are creating problems, well, seemingly creating problem for us in terms of selling weapons, and that the onus is on us to improve those conditions. It\u2019s fact and we need it now.\u201d\n\nOn 2023 elections\n\nSpeaking on the forthcoming general elections, NEF said: \u201cWe must not go to the 2023 elections with the current state of insecurity or a worse state insecurity, not just because of the elections, but because the life is getting worse by the day and it\u2019s time to reverse this trend.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to live like this. Every inch of this country has one form of security challenge or the other and there are solutions to them. It cannot be that there are no solutions to the insecurities.\n\n\u201cSo, if we can, if there are solutions, you have to ask, is the problem with the people who are supposed to find the solution? Are you saying that we can\u2019t deal with bandits and kidnappers and IPOB and ESN and people who are making billions of money from oil theft and using it for other illegal activities?\n\n\u201cThere must be something wrong in the way we are running the country. We should say so. We should raise our voices and demand that the people we voted into office, the President, the National Assembly, governors, they must do better. We can\u2019t live like rats hiding in holes and running away every year from criminals.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t. We\u2019re tired. If they can\u2019t operate the country, there is an option. There is a provision in the constitution for stepping down if you can\u2019t perform the most basic function available to you, which is to protect and secure citizens.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re saying but a few people thought that is extreme but it is a statement of fact.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Those are mainly the cases here, and encroachment on government owned land, selling of scraps and illegal motor parks by the Hausa people.\n\n\u201d The encroachment might not really be a problem, because the government can take back its land at any time, but, before then, many terrible things would wrecked havoc in the community might have taken place.\u201d He explained.\n\nResponding to the issue, Odiko McDon, Police Public Relations Officer of Akwa Ibom Police Command said that the police being aware of the criminal acts in the area had taken steps to \u2018sanitise\u2019, and \u2018calm\u2019 the area.\n\nMacdon said the police have the capacity to identify trouble makers and have been working the leadership of Nassarawa to \u2018nip in the bud any perceived challenge\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe have received reports about certain criminal acts going on around Nasarawa area.

          "text": "By Chioma Nnodim\n\nFederal Ministry of Works and Housing has concluded evaluating proposals submitted for phase one of the Value-Added Concession, VAC, under the Highway Development and Management Initiative, HDMI.\n\nThis was made known to Journalists in a press release by the Special Adviser, Communications to the Hon. Minister, Hakeem Bello, yesterday in Abuja.\n\nThe \ufb01rst phase of the VAC under the HDMI seeks to concession 12 economically viable road corridors to technically and \ufb01nancially capable private sector firms/consortia. The 12 highways represent 1,963km or 5.6% of Nigeria\u2019s 35,000km Federal Highway as follows:\n\nBenin-Asaba, Abuja-Lokoja, Kano-Katsina, Onitsha-Owerri-Aba, Sagamu-Benin and Abuja-Keffi-Akwanga Highways; the others are Kano-Maiduguri, Kano-Shuarin, Kano-Maiduguri, Potiskum-Damaturu, Lokoja-Benin, Enugu-Port Harcourt, Ilorin-Jebba, Lagos-Otta-Abeokuta and Lagos-Badagry-Seme Border.\n\nThe Value-Added Concession Request for Proposal, RFP, Evaluation Report was presented and approved on Thursday, April 21, at the Project Steering Committee, PSC, meeting chaired by the Minister of Works & Housing, Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola.\n\nMembers of the PSC from the Ministries of Works & Housing, Environment, Finance, Budget & National Planning and Justice, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, and Bureau of Public Enterprises attended the meeting.\n\nSpeaking, the Head, PPP Unit, FMWH, Abimbola Asein, disclosed that the Project Delivery Team, PDT, had concluded the evaluation of the Bidders\u2019 technical and Financial proposals and proposed Preferred/Reserved Bidders had been identified.\n\nShe, however, explained that the HDMI Project Steering Committee, PSC, reserves the right to disqualify any Preferred Bidder found to have supplied inaccurate or misleading information, following due diligence or is unable to reach a mutual agreement on the Project\u2019s Technical and Financial Parameters.\n\nThe PSC reiterated the importance of due diligence on the preferred bidders and recommended the constitution of a team made up of high-ranking officials from the relevant Ministries, noting that this would help achieve value for money for Nigeria during negotiations.\n\nThe rationale behind the HDMI, a private sector engagement, is to provide alternative sources of financing for road development and management in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is consistent with the provisions of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, ICRC, Establishment Act 2005; National Policy on Public-Private Partnership, \u201cN4P\u201d, Federal Highways Act CAP. 135, 1971; and Federal Roads and Bridges Tolling Policy.\n\n\u201cThe scope of the VAC under the HDMI includes the expansion, re-alignment, rehabilitation, and maintenance of the existing road pavements and bridges; construction of interchanges and pedestrian crossings and construction and operations of tolling facilities.\n\nThere is also the installation and operations of weighbridges; installation and operation of intelligent traffic systems for remote highway monitoring; physical patrol of the highway; provision of towing services, ambulance service, and refuse management. Others include the provision of directional signage, rest areas, and highway illumination, amongst others.\n\nThe Request for Qualification, RFQ, Notice was published on March 29, 2021, through the HDMI Portal. At the close of the RFQ portal on May 31 2021, 75 firms/Consortia successfully submitted valid applications.\n\nAn Inter-Ministerial Evaluation Committee evaluated the 75 submitted bids, wherein 18 firms / Consortia were prequalified, having met all the criteria outlined in the RFQ notice.\n\nThe RFP documents were then issued out to the 18 prequalified bidders on October 29, 2021, through the HDMI portal.\n\nThe deadline was February 22, 2022, while documents from the 18 bidders were officially opened during the RFP Bid opening ceremony held on February 23, 2022.\n\nThe Project is now at the Due Diligence Stage and will be followed by Negotiation of Technical and Financial Parameters.

          "title": "Earnings: Unilever swings back to profitability",
          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nCHALLENGES of erratic supply of public electricity, weak logistics, insecurity and other high costs of operations attributable to poor infrastructure has continued to make the business operating environment difficult, especially the real sector of the economy.\n\nThe increase in exchange rate has forced manufacturers to borrow at a high rate, thereby increasing cost of productions, made worse by the infrastructure deficiency, which has inevitably transfer the high production cost to consumers as this had made manufacturers less competitive, shrinking their profit margins, as naira\u2019s devaluation takes its toll on imported raw materials.\n\nHowever, despite the challenges, Unilever Nigeria Plc, which has for considerable period seen losses in earnings, has, during the half year 2020 swung back to profitability. Unilever built the remarkable comeback on expanding sales by the 35.07 per cent when compared to 2020, majority of it coming from its home and personal care products. When the closing bell rang on Friday, the company\u2019s share price stood at N12.20.\n\nIn its financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2020, released by the board, the revenue raked in by Unilever Nigeria dropped to N13.3 billion from N19.2 billion in the same period of last year.\n\nThe company said it had an operating profit of N453.5 million in Q1 2020, compared with N1.3 billion in Q1 2019 and a finance income of N495.6 million, lower than N803.9 million in the first quarter of last year, with the finance costs at slightly above half a million, compared with N94.4 million in Q1\u201919. Unilever Nigeria noted that while its profit before tax stood at N948.5 million versus N2.0 billion in Q1 2019, its profit after tax closed at March 31, 2020, at N1.1 billion as a result of a tax credit of N166.0 million.\n\nIn the same period of last year, the post-tax profit of the firm was N1.5 billion. The company, through its Corporate Affairs Director, Mrs. \u2018Soromidayo George, said \u201cUnilever Nigeria remains focused on its strategy to deliver sustainable growth and will continue to monitor the business environment and remain dynamic in its response to challenges to operations and the economy, in the light of COVID- 19.\u201d\n\nAccording to the filing in NGX, the company recorded a total turnover of N27.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared with N42.7 billion recorded in the same period of 2019. Also, in the results, the firm said its cost of sales stood at N21.2 billion in the period under consideration in contrast to N31.3 billion posted in the same time of 2019, while its gross profit went down to N6.2 billion from N11.4 billion.\n\nA further analysis showed that the sales and distribution expenses fell slightly to N1.8 billion from N1.9 billion, while in the first six months of 2020, the sum of N5.2 billion was used for market and administrative costs, lower than the N5.4 billion expended in the first six months of 2019. Its finance income decreased to N849.4 million from N1.2 billion, just as its finance costs significantly dropped to N5.2 million from N357.3 million.\n\nDespite having a tax credit of N47.7 million in the period under review, Unilever Nigeria declared a loss after tax of N519.1 million versus the profit after tax of N3.5 billion in the same period of last year.\n\nAlso, the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) dropped to -9 kobo from 61 kobo in H1 2019. For the Q3, Unilever Nigeria Plc has reported a loss after tax of N1.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as against loss of N3 billion in 2019. Loss before tax stood at N2.032 billion for 2020 as against N4.08 billion in 2019. Cost of sales stood at N13.66 billion from N10.68 billion in 2019.\n\nHowever, revenue grew by 93.92 per cent from N8.97 billion to N13.66 billion in 2020.\n\nAccording to analysts at Cordros Capital, the firm released its Q3-20 results with a reported loss per share of N0.27, its third quarterly loss in the last four quarters, owing to higher operating expenses and FX losses.\n\n\u201cConsequently, this dragged the 9M-20 loss per share down to N0.36. On a positive note, revenue (+93.9 per cent y/y) grew for the first time in eight quarters, far ahead of our expectations (16.2 per cent variance), underpinned by a strong recovery in volumes.\n\nUnilever Nigeria reported a profit after tax of N468.49 million for the full year ended December 31, 2020, as against loss of N4.76 billion in 2019. Profit before tax stood at N800.13 million for the 2020 as against N8.97 billion in 2019. Revenue grew by 84.34 per cent from N9.13 billion to N16.84 billion in 2020.\n\nUnilever reported a loss after tax of N1.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, against loss of N3 billion in 2019. Loss before tax stood at N2.032 billion for the 2020 as against N4.08 billion in 2019. Cost of sales stood at N13.66 billion from N10.68 billion in 2019.\n\nHowever, revenue grew by 93.92 per cent from N8.97 billion to N13.66 billion in 2020. For 2020FY, analysts at Cordros Capital noted that the company recorded a smaller Loss Per Share of -N0.28 (-62.3 per cent y/y) compared to the previous year.\n\n\u201cThe achieved revenue was in line with our estimate (-0.6 per cent variance), but was 9.3 per cent ahead of the consensus estimate for 2020FY. Although we expected a loss for the year, the 2020FY loss per share was 40.6 per cent ahead of our estimate, owing largely to positive surprises in gross margin and the finance income line.\n\nConversely, the loss per share was 17.3 per cent behind the consensus estimate.\u201d Unilever Nigeria Plc has recorded turnover of N19.4 billion in its unaudited interim report for the quarter ended 31st March 2021, (Q1\u201921), representing a growth of 46 per cent from N13.3 billion recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020,\n\nQ1\u201920. In the results released to the Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG), the company recorded a gross profit of N4.5 billion for Q1\u201921, which is 31 per cent up from N3.4 billion reported for same period of 2020. Overall, Unilever recorded loss after tax of N.5 billion for the quarter under review, compared to profit after tax of N1.1 billion reported for the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nUnilever Nigeria posted N714.780 million profit after tax for the half year ended June 30, 2021, against a loss after tax of N519.112 reported in 2020. Profit before tax stood at N830.402 million in contrast to a loss of N566.804 million posted in 2020. Revenue grew by 43 per cent to N39.150 billion in 2021 to N27.337 billion in 2020, while cost of sales was N29.275 billion in 2021 against N21.181 billion in 2020.\n\nUnilever Nigeria recorded a turnover of N58.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021, compared to N44.7 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2020. The company said this in a statement on its unaudited interim report for the period ended September 30, 2021. It recorded a gross profit of N15.9 billion in the period under review, up 61 per cent from the N9.9 billion reported for same period of 2020.\n\nUnilever reported a profit after tax of N1.08 billion in Q3 2021, compared with a loss after tax of N2.06 billion reported for the corresponding period in 2020. The company ended year 2021 on December 31 in the green to sustain profitability. The firm saw a profit of N3.409 billion for the year against a loss of N3.965 billion recorded in 2020.\n\nRevenue grew to N73.523 billion from N52.211 billion, a growth of 35.07 per cent from the previous year. Cost of sales stood at N50.161 billion in 2021 in contrast to N41.136 recorded a year earlier.\n\nBased on the result, the Directors recommend to the shareholders the payment of a dividend in respect of year ended December 31, 2021, of N2.873 billion, that is, 50 kobo gross per share, which is payable on Friday May 6, 2022, subject to the deduction of appropriate withholding tax.\n\nThe Corporate Affairs and Sustainable Business Director, Soromidayo George, said while the company remained focused on its strategy to deliver sustainable growth, it was pleased with its performance, riding on the pillars of operational efficiency, cost optimisation, purposeful brands and increasing market share across key categories.\n\n\u201cUnilever Nigeria will continue to monitor the business environment and respond appropriately to the challenges in the operating environment, as well as disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d she added.\n\nAmidst the prevailing operational challenges of the environment, Unilever Nigeria will continue to focus on its vision of making sustainable living commonplace by serving Nigerian consumers with the right products that improve their health and wellbeing,\u201d George said.\n\nUnilever Nigeria\u2019s Board of Directors recently approved steps required to implement the separation of the tea business in Nigeria.\n\nIt is important for the company to continue to focus on developing homegrown solutions that will address the business needs of people and organisations.",

          "text": "Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, has dismissed the bail application filed by a fake Army General, Bolarinwa Abiodun.\n\nAbiodun is being prosecuted on a 13-count charge bordering on obtaining money by false pretence, forgery of documents, and possession of documents containing false pretence to the tune of N266, 500,000.\n\nThe Lagos Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC) had, on April 11, 2022, arraigned the defendant on offences contrary to Section 1 (3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act 2006; Section 363 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015 and Section 6 of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offences Act No 14 of 2006, respectively.\n\nRead Also: 2023: I\u2019m Contesting In Order Not To Betray Nigerians \u2013 Osinbajo\n\nOne of the counts reads: \u201cBolarinwa Oluwasegun Abiodun, between 15th June, 2020 and 31st December 2020 in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, with intent to defraud and whilst holding yourself out as a General in the Nigerian Army, obtained the sum of N111,400,000 from Kodef Clearing Resources Limited, under the pretence that the sum represented part of the amount expended to \u201cpress and process\u201d your incoming appointment by the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, as the CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF of the Nigerian Army, which pretence you knew to be false.\u201d\n\nAnother count reads: \u201cBolarinwa Oluwasegun Abiodun, sometime in May 2020 in Lagos within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, knowingly forged LETTER OF APPOINTMENT AS CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF dated 20th May 2020 and purported the said document to have emanated from the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which document you know to be false.\u201d\n\nHe pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges.\n\nJustice Taiwo had, on April 14, heard his bail application, which was moved by his counsel, Kayode Lawal.\n\nLawal had argued that \u201cthe law provides that all accused persons are presumed innocent until found guilty\u201d.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the court to admit his client to bail \u201cpending the hearing and determination of this case and for such other order\u201d.\n\nCounsel for the EFCC, Rotimi Oyedepo, however, opposed the bail application.\n\nIn his argument, Oyedepo had noted that: \u201cThis is a situation that warrants your lordship to exercise judicial discretion against the accused.\u201d\n\nAdopting the written address of the prosecution, Oyedepo then urged the court to refuse the application for bail, arguing that \u201cnotwithstanding the purpose of the deposition in our two affidavits, there is no single reply from the applicant\u201d.\n\nCiting the case of Uket versus FRN 2007 LPLR, Oyedepo argued that \u201cThe issue is that where there is no reply to a counter-affidavit, the facts therein deposed are deemed admitted and conceded by the other party.\n\n\u201cLooking at the disposition of the person seeking your lordship\u2019s discretion, is it safe for our witnesses or is it safe for us to say the man in whose custody we have found multiple ammunition and gun be released?\n\n\u201cWe cannot put our lives in jeopardy. We will not wait until the tragedy happens. We don\u2019t want to jeopardise the life of the complainant; he\u2019s not safe.\n\n\u201cMy lord, this matter is everywhere. Even for his own safety, he should have a place that is safe for him; he should be in safe custody.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge your lordship, with due respect, to refuse the application and to order an accelerated hearing, as we are ready to expeditiously prosecute this case. And we assure my lordship that there will not be any delay.\u201d\n\nThereafter, Justice Taiwo had adjourned till April 25, to rule on the bail application.\n\nDelivering judgement on Monday, Justice Taiwo held that \u201cthe defendant did not challenge the averment of the counter-affidavit and the further affidavit of the prosecution.\n\n\u201cI am, therefore, in agreement with the prosecution that the defendant constitutes a flight risk.\n\n\u201cThough the offences against the defendant are bailable, I am inclined to refuse the application for bail and order an accelerated hearing.\n\n\u201cThus, the application for bail is refused and the defendant is to remain in prison custody, and accelerated hearing is hereby ordered,\u201d he said.",

UNHCR said that between February 28 and April 25, Ukrainian border guards had registered 1,185,500 Ukrainians returning to the country.\n\nUNHCR stressed though that \u201cthis figure reflects cross-border movements, which can be pendular, and does not necessarily indicate sustainable returns as the situation across Ukraine remains highly volatile and unpredictable.\u201d",

I hereby hold you in civil contempt,\u201d the judge said, although Trump himself was not in the courtroom.\n\nTrump intends to appeal the contempt ruling, said his attorney Alina Habba. \u201cWe respectfully disagree with the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Habba said in a statement.\n\nShould Trump fail to pay the fine, he could be jailed, according to Sarah Krissoff, a New York lawyer not involved in the case, though she said such a scenario was unlikely and the judge could opt for other remedies such as increasing the amount of the fine.\n\nJames is investigating whether the Trump Organization, the former president\u2019s New York City-based family company, misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions.\n\nShe has said the more than three-year-old probe found \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that the company included misleading asset valuations in its financial statements for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling makes clear: No one is above the law,\u201d James said in a statement on Monday.\n\nTrump, a Republican, denies wrongdoing and has called the investigation politically motivated. James is a Democrat.\n\nThe attorney general has questioned how the Trump Organization valued the Trump brand, as well as properties including golf clubs in New York and Scotland and Trump\u2019s own penthouse apartment in Midtown Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower.\n\nAlso on Monday, Engoron granted a motion by James\u2019 office to compel real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield to comply with certain subpoenas. Cushman conducted appraisals for several Trump Organization properties.\n\nTrump and two of his adult children, Ivanka and Donald Jr., also were subpoenaed and ordered to provide testimony to the attorney general. An appeal is pending for the testimony.\n\nCOERCION, NOT PUNISHMENT\n\nAndrew Amer, special litigation counsel with the attorney general\u2019s office, said during the hearing that the $10,000-a-day fine was meant to coerce Trump into complying with the subpoena, not punish him.\n\nHabba told the judge that Trump did indeed comply with the subpoena, but that he did not have any documents responsive to James\u2019 request. Engoron said she would have to submit a detailed affidavit about her search of Trump\u2019s records in order to be in compliance with the subpoena.\n\nSuch an affidavit would need to show that Trump\u2019s team had conducted a diligent search for documents, said Halim Dhanidina, a former California judge now practicing as a lawyer.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s not going to just take someone\u2019s word for it,\u201d Dhanidina said.\n\nThe Trump Organization\u2019s property valuations are also the subject of a criminal probe in Manhattan, which last year led to the indictment of the company\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said this month that probe is ongoing despite the departure of its two top lawyers.",

          "text": "Moscow accused NATO of engaging in a proxy battle against Russia by arming Ukraine, saying this had created a serious and real risk of nuclear war.\n\nIn a marked escalation of Russian rhetoric, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was asked on state television about the importance of avoiding World War Three and whether the current situation was comparable to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cThe risks now are considerable,\u201d Lavrov said, according to the ministry\u2019s transcript of the interview.\n\n\u201cI would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it,\u201d Lavrov said.\n\n\u201cNATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s remarks came as U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin was set to convene a meeting of more than 40 countries at a German air base to discuss arming Ukraine to help it fight off Russia\u2019s latest military assault in the east.\n\n\u201cThe next several weeks will be very, very critical,\u201d Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told reporters traveling with him. \u201cThey need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that\u2019s really the purpose of this conference.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to coordinate aid that includes heavy weapons such as howitzer artillery, as well as killer drones and ammunition, General Milley said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he regarded Russia\u2019s scaremongering as a sign of weakness.\n\nRussia had lost its \u201clast hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine,\u201d Kuleba wrote on Twitter after Lavrov\u2019s interview. \u201cThis only means Moscow senses defeat.\u201d\n\nBritain also played down the Russian threat.\n\n\u201cLavrov\u2019s trademark over the course of 15 years or so that he has been the Russian foreign secretary has been that sort of bravado. I don\u2019t think that right now there is an imminent threat of escalation,\u201d Armed Services Minister James Heappey told BBC Television.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Monday approved the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine. The Pentagon said the package could include ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers.\n\nMoscow\u2019s ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict.\n\nGUTERRES TO MOSCOW\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was due in Moscow on Tuesday to meet President Vladimir Putin and Lavrov, the highest profile peace mission since the war began, although Western countries have said they have little hope of a breakthrough.\n\nRussia\u2019s two-month-old invasion of Ukraine has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.\n\nMoscow calls its actions a \u201cspecial operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West call this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nWAR RAGES IN SOUTH, EAST\n\nRussia has yet to capture any of Ukraine\u2019s biggest cities. Its huge invasion force was forced to pull back from the outskirts of Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance last month. But it has since announced new war aims to focus mainly on the east, and sent more troops there for an assault on two provinces where it has backed a separatist revolt.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that every day \u2013 and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun \u2013 that everyone in Ukraine is concerned with peace, about when it will all be over,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere is no simple answer to that at this time.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said on Tuesday that Russia\u2019s offensive continued in the eastern Kharkiv region with Russian forces trying to advance towards a village called Zavody.\n\nWhile focusing on the east and south, Russia has also been striking targets in other parts of Ukraine with missiles and air strikes. Its defence ministry said it had destroyed six facilities powering railways used to deliver foreign weapons to Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s state rail company said one railway worker had been killed and four injured by Russian missile strikes on five railway stations on Monday.\n\nUkrainian forces have repelled five Russian attacks and killed just over 200 Russian servicemen, said the Ukrainian military command in the southern and eastern sectors. Five tanks were also destroyed, along with eight armoured vehicles, it said in a statement. The reports could not be verified.\n\nRussia is probably attempting to encircle heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in the country\u2019s east, the British military said in an update on Tuesday.\n\nReports say the town of Kreminna has fallen, with heavy fighting in the south of the city of Izyum, as Russian forces try to advance towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, Britain\u2019s defence ministry said on Twitter.\n\nThe governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod border province, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukraine had fired on two villages across the frontier and at least two people were wounded.\n\nRussian forces kept up their bombing and shelling of the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where fighters are hunkered down, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will start a difficult three-day trip to Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday amid criticism for the limited role played by the United Nations in the management of the crisis.\n\nThree months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, UN agencies are struggling to reach civilians under siege in the east of the country, where humanitarian assistance is sporadic.\n\nMeanwhile the UN Security Council, where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power, has failed to pass any resolutions condemning the war.\n\nGuterres may want to use this trip to revitalise the UN initiative in the humanitarian field, experts said, while staying away from more controversial political questions.\n\n\u201cGuterres will try to provide a new momentum for the UN to play a role for humanitarian access in the evacuation of civilians, especially from Mariupol, and in a broader context to allow better access of UN and other humanitarian agencies to the conflict zones,\u201d said Jean-Marc Rickli, head of Global and Emerging Risks at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.\n\nGuterres is due to meet in Moscow with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and President Vladimir Putin. But the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to kick off the first leg of his trip at the Kremlin has caused upset in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset this trip has started off on the wrong foot,\u201d said Rickli. \u201cIn such a polarised environment where disinformation is so facilitated by social media, anything Guterres will do or say might be weaponised from one side or the other of the conflict.\u201d\n\nLast month, the UN\u2019s refugee agency UNHCR came under fire by Ukrainian officials who accused it of being unprepared to address the humanitarian crisis. Similarly, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was criticised for its alleged inaction and for visiting Russia. ICRC\u2019s President Peter Maurer was in Moscow in a bid to negotiate access to the conflict areas.\n\nlined diplomatically in the peace talks led by Turkey. Analysts said Guterres may wish to discuss the role the UN could provide in future peace talks with regard to UN infrastructure and services, especially in case of a future agreement where there could be peacekeeping forces deployed. Nevertheless, they agree it is premature to talk about peace.\n\n\u201cWe should not expect any major breakthroughs out of this meeting, because the situation is not ripe for a compromise,\u201d said Andrey Kortunov, the Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council.\n\nUN weakness\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine seem ready for serious negotiations.\n\nMoscow has redeployed its forces to Ukraine\u2019s east with the goal of the conquest and probable annexation of the Donbas region. Meanwhile, Ukraine has been emboldened by the success of its resistance movement since the Russians invaded on February 24.\n\n\u201cMr Guterres is in a difficult position, because neither country is willing to hold peace talks,\u201d said Rickli.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin might want to use his meeting with Guterres to present Russia\u2019s narrative on the invasion of Ukraine, which it has framed as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to the international community.\n\n\u201cHe is likely to repeat his standard narrative about the roots of the conflict and he will try to justify his decisions,\u201d Kortunov said.\n\n\u201cHe might also complain about what he believes to be hypocrisy and double standards of the West.\u201d\n\nPutin and Guterres have very different views of the world and practice different leadership styles, Kortunov noted. Despite differences, however, Moscow has sanctioned Guterres\u2019s election to the post, and the two men have good relations.\n\nLast week, Guterres called for a ceasefire during Orthodox Easter that would allow for the safe passage of civilians from areas of current and expected confrontation in coordination with the ICRC. In addition, he called on the parties to allow for the delivery of life-saving aid to people in the hardest-hit areas such as Mariupol, the coastal city that has been besieged for weeks. His appeals were ignored.\n\nExperts said the weakness of Guterres reflects the constraints of the structure he represents.\n\n\u201cIn this environment for the UN to play a meaningful role in peacemaking is currently almost impossible. The UN\u2019s weakness is a result of its very structure, notably the veto power of the permanent members of the UN Security Council which paralyses the organisation because of the ongoing polarisation between the West and the Russia-China axis.\u201d Rickli said. Although China has called for peace talks, it has not condemned Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\nance in Ukraine, of whom more than one-third are in Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk. The UN says this figure is due to increase to 15.7 million, about 40 per cent of all Ukrainians still left in the country, if the conflict continues.\n\nDespite constraints on the ground, the UN says some 2.5 million people have been provided with assistance in the past seven weeks, including many in the east.\n\nAccording to Shabia Mantoo, spokesperson at the UNHCR, about 4.9 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24. Bhanu Bhatnagar of the World Health Organization said the body has delivered 218 tonnes of emergency and medical supplies to Ukraine and roughly two-thirds of that, about 132 tonnes, have reached their intended destinations in the east and north of the country.\n\nJakob Kern, World Food Programme emergency coordinator for Ukraine, said Mariupol would probably need about two to three trucks a day of food alone. At the moment, the agency has been able to send in 10 trucks a month.",

He proposed stronger legislative regulations including the need for every citizen in GIABA member states to be linked to a unified identification number in order to make it easier to track culprits.\n\nIn his own submissions, Secretary, Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria, REDAN, Mr. Yunusa Shuaibu, called for stricter regulation and coordination in the real sector, stressing that \u201cthe sector is currently free for all.\n\nWe are ready to cooperate at all times to achieve this feat and this is why we decided to sponsor a bill at the National Assembly\u201d, he said.\n\nDirector of Evaluation and Compliance, GIABA, Dr. Bruno Nduka, thanked the EFCC chairman for taking keen interest in the activities of GIABA and providing tremendous support to the association.\n\nA statement by the commission said the GIABA official maintained that the real estate sector remained one of the main drivers of economic growth and engine of social development across GIABA member states.\n\nThe federal government has called on all West African countries to put in place a register of beneficial owners of Real Estate properties in their respective countries so as to prevent the use of the sector as conduit for money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nAlex Enumah and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",
