          "text": "Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has urged Nigerians to wait till January 2022 for the National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, to declare whether he will be running for president in 2023 or not.\n\nHe stated this on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Hard Copy\u2019 programme aired on Friday night which was monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nOf recent, posters and billboards advertising the rumoured presidential bid of Tinubu who was Lagos governor from May 1999 to May 2007 have been seen in major cities including Lagos and Abuja.\n\nThough Tinubu has yet to declare his intention to contest any office in 2023, there have been reports and veiled indications that he might be interested in the exalted seat.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the SouthWest Agenda 2023, a political movement mobilising support for Tinubu to contest the 2023 presidential election, was inaugurated in Lagos in October by Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and other party chieftains.\n\nTinubu, who celebrated his 69th birthday in March 2021 and command an arguably large following of political loyalists, has been reported to nurse presidential ambition in 2023, even as political debates get intense for a Southern President after the eight-year regime of the incumbent, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who is from Katsina State, North-West Nigeria.\n\nSome groups and persons have also said aside from Tinubu, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; and Fashola are equally capable to be Nigeria\u2019s President.\n\nWhen asked whether he is interested in becoming the President of Nigeria, Fashola said, \u201cIt is a very tough responsibility, a very tough job; I don\u2019t envy those who have held that office and I don\u2019t envy those who aspire to take it as well.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he is speaking for any aspirant come 2023, the minister said, \u201cAs far as I am aware, nobody has said, \u2018I want to be Nigeria\u2019s President\u2019. There are people speaking for people. Nobody has come out, we are not at that stage yet.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t venture out and say that I will speak for X or Y. Let the person come out and say, \u2018I want to serve Nigeria\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt pains me sometimes when we see that very important job and responsibility to, \u2018My people said\u2019. I think the whole sense of it should be that, \u2018I am able, I have looked at myself, give me your problem, you go to sleep\u2019.\u201d\n\nOn whether he will support Tinubu\u2019s rumoured 2023 presidential bid, the two-term ex-governor of Lagos said, \u201cI saw him (Tinubu) last week, he didn\u2019t tell me he is running for office and to the best of my knowledge, the last statement he made on it is that people will know in January.\u201d\n\nFashola also said he has not asked Tinubu whether he is interested in the 2023 Presidency or not. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t ask him, I just went to ask how was doing. He has issued a statement that, \u2018I will speak in January, so let us wait till January,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Federal Government has started the payment of N1.6 billion to 167,000 women considered to be poor and vulnerable in Jigawa.\n\nThis is part of government\u2019s Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programme.\n\nMalam Mustafa Yakubu, the Training and Communication Officer, State Cash Transfer Unit (SCTU), made this known to newsmen on Saturday in Kiyawa, Jigawa State.\n\nHe spoke after monitoring the exercise at Andaza and Shuwarin villages of Kiyawa Local Government Area.\n\nYakubu said the funds were disbursed to beneficiaries via Fund and Electronic Transfer Solution (FETS Wallet), engaged by the National Cash Transfer Office.\n\nHe explained that the payment was for the months of May and June and that each beneficiary got N10,000.\n\n\u201cIn Jigawa, we have not less than 167,000 beneficiaries in the 27 local government areas.\n\n\u201cFor the all components of the programme, we are paying not less than N1.6 billion every two months,\u2019\u2019 Yakubu said.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the payment, but expressed the need for the process to be more ICT-savvy.\n\n\u201cThe application of ICT will remove the need for beneficiaries to gather in one place to collect the money.\n\n\u201cThis will help in curtailing insecurity issues surrounding the process and help the financial education of the beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cHigher deployment of ICT will also help other business activities like the POS service and the observance of social distancing protocol of COVID-19,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, SCTU also conducts coaching and mentoring for the beneficiaries on how best to utilise the money, particularly in investments.\n\n\u201cSome beneficiaries are already into one petty business or the other. So we train and advise them on how best to use the money in their businesses and trades.\n\n\u201cSome of them formed cap-making groups, some formed cooperative groups, while others engage in small scale businesses,\u2019\u2019 Yakubu added.\n\nSome of the beneficiaries, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at Andaza village, thanked the Federal Government for the gesture, saying that the stipend had transformed their lives.\n\nHarira Ahmad said the N10,000 bimonthly stipends had enabled her cap making business.\n\n\u201cWhile I share the money with my co-wife, I am still able to increase the number of caps I produce.\n\n\u201cUsing the money, I was also able to buy a goat which gave birth to two kids,\u2019\u2019 Ahmad said.\n\nAnother beneficiary, Hajara Abbas, a nursing mother, said apart from investing the money in cap-making and animals rearing, she also used part of it in taking care of her pregnancy.\n\n\u201cBefore now, I used to produce only two caps, but now I produce three and more. I also used part of the money to eat good food that will enable me to give birth to a healthy baby.\n\n\u201cHonestly this money is tackling the issue of malnutrition and risk of child and maternal mortality among us,\u2019\u2019 Abbas said.\n\nHauwa Idi, said she used the money to access antenatal and postnatal services.\n\n\u201cWhenever my husband couldn\u2019t give me transport money to go to Kiyawa Hospital, I make sure I use this money to do so.\n\n\u201cI also make sure I eat good food because it will be for me and for my baby,\u2019\u2019 Idi said.\n\nAlso speaking at Shuwarin village disbursement point, Hajara Rabi\u2019u, said she used the money she got for the first time to attend to her ill-health.\n\n\u201cAfter that, I invested in animals rearing, and as I\u2019m talking to you now, I have four sheep and three goats, apart from three he-goats that I sold.\n\n\u201cThe money from the three he-goats was what I used to venture into groundnut milling and groundnut oil production at my own level.\n\n\u201cAnd all this is in addition to my initial cap making business. So we\u2019re really grateful to this government,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nThe CCT programme requires that beneficiaries meet certain criteria like enrolling their children in public schools and getting regular check-ups at the hospital.\n\nIt seeks to break the cycle of poverty through the development of human capital.",

          "text": ".\n\nHails unity in Ninth Senate after receiving Lifetime Achievement in Politics Award\n\nBy Henry Umoru, ABUJA\n\nPRESIDENT of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan has described the 9th Senate as that which in all ways is different from the previous ones, just as he said that in the last 22 years that he has been in the National Assembly, he has never seen a united Upper chamber like the present one.\n\nLawan who hailed the prevailing atmosphere of unity among his colleagues said that it has made the ninth Senate different from the previous ones, adding that the unity among the Senators of different political persuasions and their focus and determination to work for Nigeria had made the ninth National Assembly record some successes.\n\nLawan spoke on Friday in Lagos at the 2021 award night of the New Telegraph Newspapers where he was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement in Politics Award.\n\nAlso honoured were some State Governors, Ministers and Lawmakers including the Chairman, Senate Services Committee, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, All Progressives Congress, APC, Niger East who received the Most Innovative Senator of the Year 2021 Award.\n\nAccording to a statement by his Special Adviser, Media, Ola Ola Awoniyi, the President of the Senate who spoke on behalf of the awardees, said: \u201cThis ninth Assembly, I\u2019m sure is the major reason why an award was given to me. But I want to take us back to what the chairman of the Board of New Telegraph said in his remarks at the beginning.\n\n\u201cHe said accomplishments are lifetime. Today I\u2019m 22 years plus as a member of the National Assembly and therefore if I\u2019m Senate President today by the Grace of God and we are able to achieve some feat in the Ninth Senate, I have to show my gratitude to my colleagues in the House of Representatives where I served for two terms of eight years, 1999 to 2007, and to my colleagues in the Senate where I started my journey in 2007 to date.\n\n\u201cThis is a different Senate from the previous one. As far as I can remember, I have never seen a Senate chamber that is so united, that is so determined, that is so focused on achieving a great deal of good things in legislation and representation for Nigeria like this one. I have never seen one and this is my fourth time in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in in 2019 and our colleagues decided to give us the opportunity to serve them, we all decided that this time around, we must work for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe must work together regardless of our political disposition and so far, Ninth Senate and indeed the ninth National Assembly has recorded a great deal of successes but that is not to say that we don\u2019t have our failures. We have.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in this Senate that we have been able to pass the budget before Christmas in 2020. We passed the budget before Christmas for 2021 and today by the Grace of God, we are going to pass the budget for 2022 before Christmas.\n\n\u201cThat, I\u2019m sure, gives the executive arm of government the opportunity to start the implementation of the budget in the first month of the new year, that is January.\n\n\u201cI want to also add here and I want to thank the chairman of the Board of the New Telegraph that it is this Senate and indeed this National Assembly that broke the jinx of passing the Petroleum Industry Bill that defied passage.\n\n\u201cAll previous efforts and I was a player in all those efforts from 2008 when the first PIB was presented to the National Assembly by the Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua administration.\n\n\u201cAll the efforts failed but in this Senate, we have been able to pass it and Mr President was able to assent to it and this is one very important, historic and in fact a central pillar of legislation for our country.\n\n\u201cI believe that, as politicians at all levels of governance, we should work together, we should complement each other. We should partner and ensure that we deliver services to the people of our country.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces security challenges but I think there is certainly determination at all levels of government to fight the insecurity that we face.\n\n\u201cIn some areas, we have succeeded but in others, we are still working hard to succeed. What is important is for us to continue to remain focused, remain undivided, remain united as a people.\n\n\u201cCrime by anyone is a crime. If someone in an ethnic group commits a crime, he\u2019s a criminal regardless of what he is. It doesn\u2019t matter, the country is supposed to fight against that person.\n\n\u201cCriminals should not enjoy support from any group even if it is from their ethnic group. Once again, I want to take this opportunity to thank the New Telegraph management and leadership for giving us these honours and awards and I want to assure the New Telegraph management and leadership and indeed Nigerians that these awards will spur us to do more.\u201d\n\nSenators in the company of the Senate President at the award night were the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu(the chief host), Senate Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, Senator Barau Jibrin and Senator Tokunbo Abiru.",

The stated constitutional requirement for the removal of a Speaker requires affirmation to a resolution of the House of Assembly with no less than two-thirds majority of the members.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau State House of Assembly has 24 members. Therefore, the purported attempt by eight members of the Plateau State House of Assembly to impeach the Speaker and some principal officers of the House falls far short of the constitutional requirement. It is unlawful, unconstitutional and is, therefore, an illegal act. This unlawful act by the eight lawmakers can throw the state into chaos and has indeed inflamed the already distressed state.\n\n\u201cWe at the Southern and Middle-Belt Alliance, SaMBA, hereby demand that you and the other members of the Plateau State House of Assembly retract from this illegality forthwith, failing which we will deploy the full strength of the law at home and abroad to redress the anomaly.\u201d",

          "text": "Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, has given reasons the Nigerian judiciary must address the issue of delays in processing cases through the courts.\n\nProf. Osinbajo, who had addressed the issue on previous occasions, restated his position again on Friday when he chaired a Wole Olanipekun & Co., WOC, Justice Summit on Justice Sector Reforms in celebration of the 70th birthday of Chief Wole Olanipekun, SAN, in Lagos.\n\nDescribing the issue of delays in the judicial process as the \u2018elephant in the room\u2019, the VP wondered what would happen to the country\u2019s legal profession in \u201canother 50 years given the gridlock in processing cases through the courts and the question of the integrity of the legal process, or better still, the integrity of actors in the legal process in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHighlighting delays in Nigerian courts, the Vice President recalled: \u201chow the UK Court of Appeal had occasion to comment in the case of (IPCO v.

We are all experts at knowing the problem.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President described the celebrant, Chief Olanipekun, \u201cas one of the most consequential and influential lawyers in the commonwealth\u201d, adding that beyond his accolades and achievements, he has impacted many lives through his kindness, philanthropy and faith.\n\nThanking God for giving the legal luminary \u201can ever-youthful physique and disposition, Prof. Osinbajo said, \u201cChief Olanipekun\u2019s great intellect, mastery of the law, its substance and its technicalities, his incredible ability to get to the heart of the matter and to let whole panels of judges see his sometimes daring points; his disarming wit and humour, his sometimes lyrical and poetic submissions, quoting from the classics and the Scriptures, make him easily one of the most outstanding minds in the legal profession in this or any other generation.\n\n\u201cBut I am sure that what must give him as much, if not more satisfaction, as his accomplishments in the legal profession is how he has affected the lives of hundreds, who cannot repay him for his kindness, his many charities and philanthropies and his several contributions to the growth and reach of the gospel.\u201d",

          "text": "Four months after she was reportedly humiliated by a female military officer, Lieutenant Chika Viola Anele, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member in Calabar, Ifeyinwa Ezeiruaku Fidelis is yet to get justice. The Nigerian Army has neither propitiated her nor sanctioned the erring officer. The victim says she has been battling with acute trauma, which she says has continued to impact negatively on her daily life. INNOCENT DURU asks how long it would take the Nigerian Army and the Federal Government to act on the case that has attracted negative global attention to the country.\n\nFEYINWA Ezeiruaku Fidelis, the ex-youth corps member whose video trended recently for being brutalised by a female army officer, remains yet heartbroken, having battled in vain to overcome the trauma that derived from the incident.\n\nLike a fish out of water, she has been left psychologically and emotionally traumatized as she wonders why the nation she had gone to serve would abandon her to her fate and leave her to lick her wounds.\n\nThe distraught University of Lagos alumnus told The Nation during the week that the trauma has impacted so greatly on her that she finds it difficult to sleep.\n\n\u201cAt times I remember it in my sleep and I wake up. When this happens, I play with my phone for some time before I would doze off again. I had to see a therapist and have done the test she asked me to do and submitted it to her. She said she would get back to me,\u201d she said.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDespite having met a therapist, Ifeyinwa says life has not been the same for her.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have not been feeling so easy with myself as somebody that was brutalised in that manner. I am still trying to gather myself together. At times, I do feel it all happened because I allowed her to do that to me. On the other hand, I wonder why I didn\u2019t fight back.\n\n\u201cThose kinds of things keep coming back to me. My people have been telling me to let go so that I would live my normal life. Even the therapist I met told me to shake it off myself and I would get better. She said that is how it normally disturbs people but with time, I would be okay.\u201d\n\nShe noted that one of the terrible effects the incident has had on her is that she has withdrawn into her cocoon.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have been staying on my own so that I don\u2019t get insulted or bullied. I am trying to be calm. I don\u2019t talk to people and I stay on my own. I don\u2019t get involved with people and I don\u2019t want to be exposed easily.\n\n\u201cI have been reading a lot of things people said about me online. Some are saying that I am stupid others are saying that I am stubborn. In short, different kinds of insult. You know how some Nigerians talk.\n\n\u201cSome of the comments are on my side while some others are not. I kind of think about it. I am not my normal self but I am trying to gather myself together.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident, Ifeyinwa had been asked by the authorities of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to leave Calabar where she was serving her fatherland for security reasons.\n\nShe had barely a few weeks to end the programme when the incident occurred. Her batch of NYSC members completed their service year in October.\n\nAsked if she had been given her discharge certificate by the NYSC, Ifeyinwa said she had not, adding: \u201cThere was a time they (NYSC) invited me to come for my certificate in Abuja but my parents were scared. They said I wouldn\u2019t go for now. Everybody around me was scared of letting me go, so I am yet to collect it.\n\n\u201cIt is not that they didn\u2019t want to give me my certificate. They called me to come for it, but my parents said they were scared and could not allow me to go.\u201d\n\nAside from reports of a tacit apology and condemnation of the incident by the military authorities, Ifeyinwa said the Nigerian Army was yet to reach out to her with a view to assuaging her trauma.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe military has not called me since then to say anything. I am not aware if they have done anything to the woman. I don\u2019t know anything.\n\n\u201cI am not searching for work yet. I am still taking my time. By next year, I will go into that one (searching for a job) properly. My lawyer is handling my case pro bono (without charges).\u201d\n\nThe army had said it was embarrassed by the incident and apologised for it.\n\nArmy spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu, had said in a statement: \u201cThe Nigerian Army wishes to tender unreserved apology to the victim, her family members, friends, National Youth Service Corps and to Nigerians in general for the unwholesome treatment meted out to the corps member.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu, a Brigadier-General, said the erring officer had been identified and would be \u201cmade to undergo regimental orders (trial) in line with the extant provisions of the Armed Forces\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis act is not only condemnable but unprofessional and against established precepts of discipline in the Nigerian Army,\u201d he added.\n\nSpokesperson of the 13th Brigade, Calabar where the incident occurred had also told The Nation that the issue was more with her.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have sent a report already. You have seen a report from my directorate. I don\u2019t know what you are calling and asking me for.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about the officer going for training. It is no more in my hands. It is in the hands of my director.\n\n\u201cYou can call Abuja. You can call my director to confirm. It is not me you will call now.\u201d\n\nWe \u2018ll wait for them in court \u2014Victim\u2019s lawyer\n\nIfeyinwa\u2019s lawyer, Barrister Eni Okoi, in a telephone chat with our correspondent, said he had filed the case in court and was optimistic that his client would get justice.\n\n\u201cWe have served all the parties. The matter is coming up on November 29. We have not heard anything from them so I do not know what angle they want to take. Nobody from the military has called. I am sure they are waiting to meet us in court. It is a big embarrassment to the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cNYSC has not reached out to us but I heard that they reached out to our client. I think they are looking forward to giving her an NYSC certificate. That is where we are now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the NYSC has any problem with her. But we joined them in the case because our client was a corps member when this whole thing happened.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had faced any challenges in the course of handling Ifeyinwa\u2019s issue, Okoi said: \u201cI have not had any challenge doing all this. But naturally, we are human beings, we have to be apprehensive.\n\n\u201cYou will be apprehensive if you are suing the Nigerian Army. They know they will lose a lot of money and somebody may lose his or her job. We have to be apprehensive, although no threat has come my way.\n\n\u201cWe just have to be careful, watch and pray as the Bible says. They have been very civil with regard to this matter. Nobody has disturbed anybody. We will all meet in court.\u201d\n\nArmy spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu, was yet to respond to our enquiry on the court case filed by Ifeyinwa\u2019s lawyer.\n\nNYSC authorities were also yet to respond. Calls to the organisation\u2019s spokesperson, Adenike Adeyemi was unsuccessful as her number was not reachable. She was also yet to respond to a text message sent to her mobile line.\n\nHow it all began\n\nIfeyinwa, a female youth corps member serving in Calabar, Cross River State, was on July 28, 2021 brutalised by a female military officer, Lieutenant Chika Viola Anele. The video of the incident had gone viral on September 23.\n\n\u201cIt was after I sent it to my brother that the thing went viral.\n\n\u201cThe incident started when the commander of the brigade hosted a drilling competition and I was chosen as part of those who would usher in guests.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the place, Ebutu Barracks, I saw one of my captain friends, a married Muslim. We played the ayo (a popular indigenous game) together.\n\n\u201cOn sighting him, I tapped at him and joked that he was even there before the ushers and we started laughing only for the lady to shout at me, saying, \u2018You don\u2019t touch an officer in uniform\u2019.\n\n\u201cI went back to my position. But while I stood there, another officer, a Lieutenant Colonel, came and offered me a handshake, but I said we were told not to shake hands with officers in uniform. The female officer who was behind me, responded by saying, \u2018You can shake but don\u2019t touch\u2019. I said nothing and kept standing.\n\n\u201cShe was in charge of the small chops we were to share. They counted the ones they would give to umpires and gave us the rest to share. After sharing it, I went back to my post.\n\n\u201cOne Major called and asked me to change his for him, but I told him that the ones he wanted were for the umpires and that they had been counted.",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, and his Adamawa State counterpart, Ahmadu Fintiri, have reflected on the type of presidential candidate the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) needs to take over power in 2023.\n\nWhile Wike was concerned about how and when the candidate would emerge, Fintiri, dwelled on the character and qualities of the candidate, saying he was not in support of zoning.\n\nA statement signed by Wike\u2019s Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, said the duo spoke when Wike paid a courtesy visit to Fintiri at the Government House, Yola, on Friday.\n\nWike and his entourage were in Yola to appreciate Fintiri, who was the Chairman of the PDP Convention Planning Committee for successfully conducting the exercise.\n\nWike said stakeholders in the party would at the right time collectively decide the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said that the PDP was ready to take over power at the centre in 2023 following the success of its convention.\n\nThe Rivers state governor commended Fintiri and members of the PDP convention planning committee for making the party proud by conducting a transparent and rancour-free convention.\n\n\u201cFor making our party proud, today Nigerians believe that PDP has put themselves in a position to take over the affairs of this country. It was not easy\u201d, he said.\n\nWike said that those, who had not participated in organising a party convention might presume it was an easy feat to accomplish.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt a time most people were expecting that it may not work out for PDP. It only did not work out well, it was peacefully conducted, the best ever conducted since PDP started.\n\n\u201cI believe that when people have done well, you commend them. When you give them another opportunity, they will put in their best. And that is one of the things I have come today to say my brother, you\u2019ve done well with your people. You did not put us to shame.\u201d\n\nWike noted that when he and others nominated Fintiri as the chairman of the convention planning committee, they never had any reservation about his capacity to deliver a credible and transparent convention.\n\n\u201d Today, Ahmadu Fintiri has become a household name in Nigerian politics, because of the convention he conducted very transparently. Thank you for what you have done for our great party\u201d, he said.\n\nThe governor also used the occasion to shower encomium on Fintiri for his developmental strides in Adamawa State, particularly in Yola, the State capital.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow much does he get from the federation account,\n\nyet he is able to judiciously put them into use for the interest and development of Adamawa State. If other people had done this within the city, he would have moved on to other areas that need attention. I want to plea to all of you to continue to give him the support.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Fintiri said the successful conduct of the PDP convention had provided Nigerians, especially the younger generation, an alternative platform to elect the next Nigerian president in 2023.\n\nHe urged Wike, who he acknowledged contributed immeasurably to the success of the convention, not to relent in his support for the party in the years ahead.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are not just colleagues, we are not just in the same party, we have discovered ourselves to be good friends and even metamorphosing into being brothers. This is what we need in this country.\n\n\u201cThat is why I am not a supporter of those who are calling for zoning of the presidency. I am for those that are calling for good candidates that can bring this country together, and improve on the potentials that abound in both the humans and capital of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut, I trust that whoever we are going to get as our presidential candidate in 2023, will be the person that Nigerians want, will be the person that understands this country, and will be the person that will pull this country together and put her where she belongs in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nThe Adamawa State governor said his administration had been doing its best to attract people into the party by embarking on human and infrastructural development.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy considering the available resources, but through fiscal discipline and elimination of waste by in governance, we are able to save and put it into developmental projects.\u201d\n\nFintiri commended all the PDP governors and other stakeholders of the party for giving his committee the opportunity to serve.\n\nHe said: \u201cGod, through his wisdom has seen us through. We have a stable party that is ready to take government in 2023. We must thank you for your thoughtfulness to come on this courtesy call to appreciate the little we were able to do in carrying out this assignment on behalf of all of us.\u201d",

My body was shaking. They showed me the statement, I did not volunteer the statement. I was just asked to sign it. Princess dictated everything to them.\u201d\n\nBaba Ijesha said when Inspector Oname Abigail arrived Princess\u2019 house on April 19, the day he was arrested, the complainant hid some boys who were beating him inside a room before allowing her to come inside.\n\nHe said that when he was led outside, some boys again came and beat him until he was rescued by some police officers who took him on a bike to Sabo Divisional Police Headquarters and locked him up in a cell after they had removed the handcuffs on his hands.\n\nUnder cross examination by the prosecuting counsel, Yusuf Sule, Baba Ijesha insisted he did not volunteer the statement but that the content was dic tated to the police by the complainant.\n\nHe also denied knowledge of the current residence of the complainant, insisting that only her former residence was known to him.\n\nHe however owned up to the names of his father, mother, primary and secondary schools attended, his age, dropping out of University of Lagos, Akoka when he could no longer cope with a course he was studying.\n\nBaba Ijesha failed to respond when confronted by the prosecution that the IPO could not have known his details if he did not volunteer any information to her.\n\nEarlier, Inspector Abigail, under examination by Awosika said the defendant freely volunteered his statement and that it was made without duress.\n\nAbigail insisted she read cautionary words to Baba Ijesha and that he told her he understood English and everything she read to him.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe defendant was shak ing when I was about to take his statement. I offered him a chair to sit, to relax him but he said he preferred sitting on the floor \u201cto enable him to stretch out his legs.\n\n\u201cI calmed him down and told him he has to write his statement. I asked him questions in English and he responded to all of them in English.\n\nHe requested that I should help him to write his statement as he could not write because he was shaking.\n\n\u201cWhen we finished, I read the statement to him and he told me he understood everything and after that he signed the statement.\u2019\n\nShe said after taking the statement of both the complainant and defendant, she took both of them back to the DPO.\n\nEarlier, during resumed proceedings, Babatunde Ogala, SAN, also a counsel to the defendant had objected to the admissibility of the confessional statement of Baba Ijesha.\n\nOgala told the court that he objected to the statement being admitted as evidence against the defendant on the grounds that it was not freely given.\n\nAccording to him, the defendant was sitting on the floor, the failure of the IPO to sign or disclose that she recorded it contrary to provisions of the Evidence Act.\n\nHe had then requested for a trial-within-trial to determine voluntariness of the document.\n\nJustice Taiwo fixed December 2 for adoption of written addresses by counsel\n\nBaba Ijesha is facing a six-count charge bordering on allegations of indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nHe had pleaded not guilty to the six-count charge.\n\nSix witnesses have testified so far since the prosecution opened its case in August.\n\nThey include the complainant, comedienne Damilola Adekoya popularly called Princess, and her 14-year old foster daughter who was said to have been molested by the defendant in 2014 and April 2021.",

          "title": "Fresh facts in mystery death of OAU MBA student at Ile-Ife hotel",
          "text": "As emotions keep rising over the death of Timothy Oluwadare Adegoke at Hilton Hotel and Resort, Ile-Ife, penultimate weekend,The Nation has seen a picture of the deceased covered with what looks like bruises and blood stains.\n\nThe picture, which is too gory to be published, was taken where the body was allegedly dumped.\n\nThe blood stains are mainly on his right elbow, upper part of his left thigh and vest.\n\nHis two legs were spread apart. There was a deep grey sack around his head.\n\nHe wore a round neck white singlet and a navy blue pair of boxers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, the police insist that the body is intact while some of the suspects have reportedly told the police that the victim died in his sleep naturally.\n\nThe hotel has since been shut down but sources close to the management claimed yesterday that \u201cthe initial denial of the hotel management as to whether Adegoke lodged with them was because there was no record of any payment by him in the Hotel\u2019s account, but it was later that it was detected that he made payment into the personal account of the receptionist which normally is wrong.\u201d\n\nThirty-seven year-old Adegoke was a Master\u2019s degree student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.\n\nHe had travelled from his base in Abuja to Ile-Ife on Friday ,November 5 to write his last examination, without the least suspicion that death was lurking in the corner.\n\nThe late Director of Finance at Xiamien Stone Limited, Abuja, according to investigation, flew from Abuja to Akure in Ondo State. His plane landed in the Ondo State capital at 3pm.\n\nHe then proceeded to Ile-Ife by road, hitting town at about 4.45pm.\n\nHe chose to lodge at Hilton Hotel and Resort located on the Ife-Ibadan expressway opposite Ife Central Local Government Area secretariat ,booking for a deluxe suite at N18500 per night for two nights.\n\nFor payment, he was said to have transferred N37000 to the personal account of the hotel\u2019s receptionist, identified as Adesola.\n\nAdegoke ,a family source said, notified his wife that he checked into his hotel room but did not disclose the name. He also made another bank transfer to her.\n\n\u201cHe told his wife that he wanted to take a nap before reading for his exam,\u201d the source said,adding: \u201cthe wife decided not to disturb him because she believed he was either sleeping or reading, so she suspended calling him till Saturday morning.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the source said:\u201d The wife called the following morning to check on Adegoke but his phone rang out of time.\n\n\u201cShe thought her husband already had left for the examination hall so she suspended the calls till afternoon when she tried the number again. However, she began to feel that it was unusual of him not to call her before going for examination.\n\n\u201cShe was very worried and she called me and one other cousin of her husband living in Ondo State on Saturday afternoon to inform us that she was unable to speak with her husband.\n\n\u201cThis prompted me to contact a close friend\u2019s wife who was in Ile-Ife to help me go to the examination hall on Sunday. She was in the examination centre at OAU Center for Distance Learning, Moro, with the first cousin of Adegoke to check if he was at the exam hall around 10 am.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coordinator of the exam hall checked the attendance sheet and they discovered that he was not present at the exam hall on Saturday and Sunday. He advised that we should check all the hotels in Moro which we did.We could not find him.\n\n\u201cThe Dean of Adegoke\u2019s faculty informed the chairman of the hoteliers association in Ife if any of their members knew the whereabouts of our brother but the chairman of the association gave us a feedback none of their members had the record of Adegoke.\n\n\u201cThis prompted us to report the matter at Edunabon police station on Sunday, 7th November 2021 of the mysterious disappearance of our brother. We went together with the authority of OAU to report the matter and the police told us that they would transfer the case to Police Headquarters, Osogbo on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe wife called the personal assistant of her husband if he had any information on how they could locate his husband but the PA said he called the number of his boss and a strange person picked it on Sunday night informing him that he found the phone in Ejigbo.\n\n\u201cI called the number immediately, the person picked and told me \u2018hello\u2019 only to terminate the call abruptly and switched off.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Police Command on Monday to write a statement. They asked us for the name of the hotel that he had lodged previously but we told the police that we did not know. We also inquired from his wife, and she said she didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cAdegoke\u2019s phone was tracked by the police and it was revealed that it was in Ejigbo, Osun State. They also asked if we had his email address and his password for tracking. We provided the email address but we didn\u2019t know the password.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, 9th November 2021, the wife searched the house and found the receipt of Hilton Hotel, Ile-Ife of a previous lodging in one of the pockets of her husband. She snapped and sent it to the police. This made the police and the elder brother of Adegoke visit the hotel but the staff denied that he lodged in the hotel that weekend.\n\n\u201cThe elder brother was emotional at a point, he called me on phone saying, \u2018I am standing in front of the hotel owner now and they are denying that my brother lodged here\u2019. They left the place and did not make any arrest since we didn\u2019t have concrete evidence that he slept in that hotel.\u201d\n\nThe family source said a clue appeared on Thursday, November 11 after the police demanded that \u201cwe should get Adegoke\u2019s bank statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe made it availabele to them. The statement of the bank indicated that he made a transaction at 5 PM on the Friday he arrived the hotel. He sent money to two persons: his wife and one Adedeji Adesola Tobilola. He sent N37,000 to that Adesola. They tracked the phone number of that account holder (Adesola) to Hilton Hotel.\n\n\u201cWe went to the hotel and the hotel paraded all the staff before the police. They asked who bears Adedeji Adesola Tobiloba and a female receptionist signified by raising her finger.\n\n\u201cShe said Adegoke came to the hotel on Friday to lodge but he only transferred N37,000 to her account and left hurriedly without returning to the hotel. She said she never reported the matter to the hotel management but rather she shared the money with the manager of the company.He (manager) denied the allegation..\n\n\u201cWhen she got to the station, she confessed that he (Adegoke) lodged in room 305. Police did not tell us anything before they arrested five people including an alfa who claimed he travelled to Ejigbo.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, 15th, 2021, one of the hotel staff led the police and four family members to where Adegoke was buried in Ile-Ife. When the police exhumed the body, we discovered that they packed his corpse inside a carton wrapped with a duvet with the name of the hotel. The neck of Adegoke was slit.\n\n\u201cThe police proceeded to arrest the chairman of the hotel, Dr. Rahmon Adedoyin without disclosing the reason for doing so to us.\u201d\n\nAdedoyin and other suspects are still being interrogated by the police.\n\nOur own story,Adedoyin\u2019s lawyer\n\nContacted yesterday,Adedoyin\u2019s lawyer of 15 years ,Barrister Williams Abiodun,said there is nothing in the account record of the hotel showing that Adegoke paid to lodge there.\n\nHe said the police first arrested one Adesola,the hotel\u2019s receptionist ,and following her statement, the police \u201cnotified me that they needed to question other staff and I took five of them to the police but they were detained.\n\n\u201cWhen they interrogated Adesola, she disclosed that the man (Adegoke) transferred the money into her personal account and (the money) was stolen without recoding it in the hotel\u2019s account. \u201cShe shared the money with another staff. That was why the hotel initially denied that Adegoke lodged in the hotel.\n\n\u201cLast week Saturday, the Investigating Police Officer (IPO) told me that all the arrested staff had confessed that Adegoke actually slept in the hotel but died in his sleep naturally.\n\n\u201cThe staff had shared the money that was paid by the guest and did not input it in the record. \u201cThey knew there was a problem, they took the body in the dead of the night and dumped it somewhere and returned to the hotel as if nothing happened.\n\n\u201cChief (Adedoyin) questioned them repeatedly but they all denied it until police forced them to talk.\n\n\u201cThey did not bury the body, they took the police to where the body was dumped. Where they dumped the body was on farmland on the Ife/Osogbo road. The farmers hinted the police.\n\n\u201cOnly two staff were involved in dumping the corpse of Adegoke: the receptionist and one Kosim who is the plumber of the hotel. Kosim is this Tabligh Muslim, not a spiritualist.\u201d\n\nHe said the body of the victim was recovered in the presence of the Osun Police Commissioner, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) and some other people.\n\nHe added: \u201cAdegoke\u2019s body was intact when it was recovered. He died a natural death because he was resting his head on his palm. He spread his legs tiredly. There was no single mark of violence on his body. The only offence these people committed was wrongful interference and dumping of the dead body.\u201d\n\nHe denied suggestions in some quarters that Adedoyin attempted to bribe the family of the deceased.\n\n\u201cAdedoyin never sent me to any of the family members of the deceased to bribe them,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\n\u201cI have never seen any member of the victim\u2019s family. Chief was not around when the incident happened. I don\u2019t know when his corpse was discovered in the hotel room, but it seems he died on Friday night or Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe IPO told me that the guy was feeling sick on the 5th of November, that was the reason why the wife worried and called her husband on 6th repeatedly without anybody picking. The remains were probably discovered on Sunday by one of the workers.\u201d\n\nHe added that those who were arrested mentioned of the name Chief Adedoyin as the owner of the hotel and he was invited and has been detained since Monday.\n\n\u201cI went with Chief Adedoyin on Monday to the Police Command, Osogbo where he gave his statement. He voluntarily submitted himself. He was never in any way indicted by the six arrested suspects.\u201d\n\nHe said the hotel manager , Aderogba Adeniyi was arrested alongside other suspects.\n\nHe also denied that the son of the hotel owner was arrested .\n\nHe asked the police to \u201c do a discrete job and anybody found wanting should be probably prosecuted, no matter how highly placed the person is.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201c We intentionally don\u2019t want to free the suspects legally from police detention because we want the police to conduct their investigation very well without interference and let the whole world know that Adegoke died a natural death. The staff only interfered with the corpse.\u201d\n\nThe hotel is currently under lock and key while investigation into the circumstances surrounding Adegoke\u2019s death continues.\n\nAnother source close to Adedoyin believe there is a deliberate attempt to rubbish him.\n\nThe source denied suggestions that Adegoke was killed for rituals and said \u201cthe initial denial of the hotel management as to whether Adegoke lodged with them was because there was no record of any payment by him in the Hotel\u2019s account, but it was later that it was detected that he made payment into the personal account of the receptionist which normally is wrong.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cthe late Adegoke left the hotel like many other customers after finding out that neither light nor water was available, and the CCTV cameras were out of order as a result of renovation work being carried out at the hotel.\n\n\u201cThe hotel has operated for less than two years and had never recorded any death as the public was led to believe by the deceased brother\n\n\u201cThe lady receptionist who was recently employed by the hotel is on a salary of twenty-five thousand naira (N25,000) and not two hundred thousand naira (N200,000) as being spread in some media.\n\n\u201cThe person called Alfa which could be misinterpreted as an Islamic cleric and possibly a spiritualist or ritualist is actually a plumber and maintenance manager in the hotel and is neither a cleric nor a ritualist.\n\n\u201c Dr. Adedoyin is not personally involved in the day-to-day running of the hotel as he has other more important businesses which include five tertiary institutions within and outside Nigeria, security outfit, publishing and hospitality business.\u201d\n\nAdedoyin: My hands are clean\n\nThe hotel owner,Dr.Rahman Adedoyin,in an audio message from detention yesterday said his hands are clean in the death of Adegoke.\n\nSpeaking in Yoruba,65 year old Adedoyin said he has been wealthy since he was 26 years after starting as a home lesson teacher.\n\nHe said he never left Ife before God \u201cblessed me\u201d.\n\nHe said he has never been involved in money rituals and pleaded with the public to conduct their investigation into the matter.\n\nHe said he did not know about the death of Adegoke in his hotel until the police started searching for him.\n\nPolice source: Why Adegoke paid into hotel staff\u2019s account\n\nA highly placed police source told The Nation that the hotel receptionist had told Adegoke that the facility had run out of diesel to power its generator.\n\n\u201cShe asked Adegoke to pay into her personal account so that she could use part of the money to procure fuel which he (Adegoke) agreed to,\u201d the source said.\n\nHis killers must be made to feel our pains \u2013 Adegokes\n\nThe deceased turned 37 only last August,according to his elder brother, Olugbade Adegoke.\n\n\u201cHe was the breadwinner of the whole family. He was more educated than all of us in the family,\u201d he said in an emotion \u2013laden vice.\n\n\u201cHe was the third born of our parents.\n\n\u201cHe had been doing the Master\u2019s programme when he was in Ondo before he was transferred to Abuja. He left Ondo around May 2021 for Abuja and moved his family with him in September 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen we visited the hotel, we discovered that there were bloodstains in the room where he slept and they had already changed the mattress and curtains of the room because it was different from all others of its category. I took the pictures.\n\n\u201cWe demand that the police should press murder charges those involved in the death of my younger brother.\n\n\u201cThe deceased had three children. The firstborn are seven-year-old twins and another two-year-old baby. I want the perpetrators to feel our pains.\n\n\u201cMy brother had the prospect of becoming the managing director of the company he was working for. He had two mobile policemen securing him and an official car in Abuja but because he was coming down to Ile-Ife for an exam he felt it was needless to travel with them. He was killed during his last exam in the school.\u201d\n\nFamily to Police: All culprits must be brought to book\n\nCounsel to the bereaved family,Kayode Ajulo,in a statement yesterday commended the police for a job well done so far,but said all the culprits in the matter must be brought to book in the overriding interest of justice.\n\n\u201cIt is worrisome and sad that Mr. Timothy Oludare can be cut down in his prime for motives best known to his killers which of course, must be extracted and investigated by the Police without delay. It portends serious danger that a place meant to serve the temporary accommodation needs of Nigerians and non-Nigerians alike could in actual fact be a place where cold-blooded murders are orchestrated and carried out in the most desperate and daring manner. Again, we note the temerity and the audacity in which the murder of the late Timothy Oludare was carried out as contained in the preliminary findings made by the Osun State Police Command. According to the findings, our Client\u2019s son was strangled to death in his hotel room, his body was subsequently mutilated and wrapped in a blood-soaked blanket/bedsheet belonging to the hotel and finally buried in a shallow grave near the hotel.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that an offender(s) who causes the death of a person is guilty of murder under 316 of the Criminal Code Laws Cap 34, Laws of Osun State and same is punishable by death under Section 319 of the same law and it is our legally considered view that the confessional statements as obtained from some of the suspects are cogent enough to establish the varying degrees of guilt of all the suspects.\n\n\u201cAs things stand, the hotel and its vicinity are a crime scene and should be treated as such, nothing must be on the way of a thorough and wider investigation of this highly reprehensible murder because nobody irrespective of their status or influence is bigger than the extant laws of the land.\n\n\u201cWe therefore urge utmost professionalism by the Police in this matter; no stone must be left unturned to get to the root of this matter. On our part, we are ready to partner with the Police to ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done. While we trust that this matter will reach its expected legal conclusion, we want to reiterate that we will not hesitate for a second to do everything within legally permissible limits to fight anyone who attempts to frustrate the expected end of justice.\n\n\u201cAs it is historically believed that Ile-Ife is the cradle of the human race, it is important that the ancient city and by extension, other parts of the nation must not be allowed to become safe havens for murderers and other criminals alike. It shreds our collective humanity into pieces when the blood of any innocent Nigerian can be spilled without consequences.\u201d\n\nHis exhumed body is intact\u2014 Police\n\nHowever, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Osun State Police Command, SP Yemisi Opalola said body of the victim which was exhumed by the police in the presence of the family members remains intact.\n\n\u201cNo part of the body was missing when it was exhumed,\u201d Opalola said.\n\nHe added: \u201cinvestigation by the police indicates that Adegoke slept inside Hilton Hotel and Resort, Ile-Ife, and he was traced to the hotel.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the investigation, we arrested six workers connected to the issue. Further investigation led to the arrest of the owner of the Hotel. Dr Rahman Adedoyin. He is still in our custody. The corpse has been exhumed and deposited at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital morgue.\n\n\u201cThe relations were present when the corpse was exhumed. A pathologist and the Commissioner of Police were also present . No part of the body was missing when it was exhumed. I plead with Nigerians not to stir up controversy. Allow the police to conduct a diligent investigation to unravel the mystery behind the death of Adegoke.\u201d",

          "title": "Controversies, counter-accusations trail leaked EndSARS panel report",
          "text": "By Job Osazuwa\n\nThe traditional and social media spaces have been awash with hot debate over the report submitted recently by the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters.\n\nFor one year, Nigerians waited patiently for the report to be released. But when it was eventually done, the report that is said to have indicted Nigerian Army and Police of cold-blooded \u201cmassacre\u201d of innocent civilians calling for an end to police brutality, ended up polarizing rather than uniting them.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nSince it was leaked to the public, many Nigerians, particularly the youths, have lambasted the government and its agencies for allegedly killing unarmed protesters. But there are others who have accused its compilers of bias. They insist that the report is characterised by fiction, discrepancies and assumptions. On radio, TV, social media, newspaper pages, this has led to arguments, accusations and counter-accusations. Those asking for a thorough examination of the report said they cannot understand why some persons said to be dead, according to the report, are still alive.\n\nThe panel, led by Justice Doris Okuwobi in the report submitted to Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on November 15, 2021, disclosed that at least 48 protesters were either shot dead, injured with bullet wounds, or assaulted by soldiers sent to Lekki Tollgate on October 20, 2020 to disperse the peaceful protesters.\n\nJubilation, satisfaction among #EndSARS supporters\n\nAs witnessed so far, some of the Nigerians that mobilised other citizens to join the nationwide are jubilating over the report, saying that they have been vindicated. They include Senator Shehu Sani. Shortly after the report went viral, he took to his twitter handle to write: \u201cIt is like people are holding cutlasses and sticks and looking for those who denied the Lekki massacre.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Rinu Oduola twitted: \u201cEveryone that joined hands in making us doubt our sanity regarding the Lekki massacre, God will punish you\u201d! A journalist, Fisayo Soyombo, also tweeted: \u201cThe Lagos doctor sent by the state to go round hospitals to confirm the #EndSARS casualties from the Lekki massacre and withdraw the bullets extricated from the injured protesters, how do you feel now that all you tried to cover up has been fully exposed\u201d?\n\nDoubts, unanswered questions\n\nBy way of providing a contrary view to that held by those applauding the \u201cgood work\u201d done by the panel, and calling for the crucifixion of those indicted, a certain Otabor Osagie wrote on his facebook page: \u201cNathaniel Solomon one of those the panel said to have died has been found alive. Even Kolade Salami that SARS operatives killed in 2019 was listed among Lekki victims. He even granted an interview narrating how he fainted.\u201d In a telephone conversation with the reporter, another Nigerian, Amos Tunde challenged the objectivity of the report. \u201cHow can you include those who are aggrieved to be members of the panel? I knew there would be a conflict of interest at the end of the day. And that is what we are seeing today.\u201d He lamented that though there was enough time for the investigation to be neatly done, there are many mix-ups. \u201cAnd, you don\u2019t expect Nigerians to accept this report.\u201d\n\nAnother Nigerian and public intellectual, Mr Temitope Ajayi, wrote on his Facebook Page: \u201cIf the leaked document in circulation is actually what was submitted to Governor Sanwo-Olu yesterday, the state government should demand some kind of refund on expended tax payers\u2019 money. I can\u2019t see any reason why it should take one year to put together the report in circulation. It is very shoddy in preparation and untidy in its assumptions and conclusions.\n\n\u201cFor some strange reasons, the report has no word for the police officers that were killed and many victims of the violent protests, especially those who lost livelihoods. \u201cDoes it mean the lives of the murdered police officers are not important or they deserved to die in such undignified manner?\n\n\u201cIt is really befuddling that a panel that sat for a whole year didn\u2019t pay attention to details and facts.\n\n\u201cThe panel listed Nathaniel Solomon, a man that granted video interview as a deceased victim of LekkiTollgate. The video interview was published on September 11, 2021. Kolade Salami that was killed in April 2019 by men of SARS was named as another deceased. I have seen other posts where three names among the 11 listed as deceased by the Panel are said to be alive and kicking.\n\n\u201cI guess the panel relied more on social media rumours and gist to arrive at some of the conclusions.\u201d\n\nCalling for caution by all parties involved, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, in a press release, advised Nigerians to restrain themselves from spreading rumours that will further compound the issues, insisting that the purpose of government in setting up the panel was to heal wounds.\n\nA part of the release read: \u201cThe Lagos State Government has noted the various reactions that have followed the submission of the report. There have been arguments in the public space over the report. There is need for us to restrain ourselves from nullifying the good intentions of the government in setting up this panel, which was well encouraged to do its job \u2013 a fact that was acknowledged by the panel.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015, a committee has been set up to bring up a White Paper on the report to determine the next line of action. At the appropriate time, the government will make known its views on all the issues raised by the Panel through the release of a White Paper.\u201d\n\nErrors, discrepancies, irregularities in report\n\nAnalysts who subjected the document to a \u201cthorough examination\u201d pointed out, according to them, some irreconcilable differences. One of them, Adejare Ibrahim, noted: \u201cThe panel, under the chairmanship of Justice Okuwobi, did a great disservice to many Nigerians. The report is a pure distortion of glaring facts and cannot, in the face of in-depth probe and sophisticated analysis, stand the test of time. The report is fraught with discrepancies, irregularities and fallacious stances, which further substantiates the claim of some Nigerians that no one truly died in Lekki Tollgate.\u201d\n\nHe gave out some proofs of the points he was trying to make as follows: \u201cKolade Johnson (Salami) was shot during a raid by officers of the Nigeria Police Command at Onipetesi, Lagos-Abeokuta Road while watching an English premiership match between Tottenham and Manchester United on March 31, 2019. Why did they mix it up with Lekki issue? Kolade had nothing to do with Lekki violence.\n\n\u201cOn Nathaniel Solomon and Abuta Solomon, on September 11, 2021, a national newspaper had an interview with Nathaniel, where he claimed that he fainted the day he saw his brother\u2019s lifeless body at Lekki Tollgate. The person he claimed to be his brother was Abuta. The panel also published Nathaniel Solomon as one of the Lekki casualties.\n\n\u201cAmidst the spread of fake news by EndSARS supporters that one Folorunso Olabisi was shot by the Army and his corpse deposited at St. Nicholas Hospital, VI, Lagos, the management of the Hospital later debunked the malicious claims. Till date, no one has countered the claim of the hospital. How then the name later crept into the report is surprising.\n\n\u201cOne Jide was mentioned. This is laughable. I don\u2019t want to believe that a retired Justice of the Lagos High Court approved this for public consumption. Who is Jide? No surname and no description. The same thing with Tola; Wisdom, no surnames or further details.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he mentioned other instances in the report, which he said were difficult to reconcile with what really transpired, particularly after one year of investigation. The panel should have understood that Nigerians were critical thinkers who would not accept everything thrown at them without probing, he noted. \u201cAfter all, the family members of the Ikoyi collapsed building victims, within hours, quickly showed up after the incident. Why have the family members of the Lekki victims not shown up after a year? Are they still afraid? I implore Sanwo-Olu to think deep and ponder on this report before accepting it as a fact,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nHe opined that those who killed and maimed Nigeria\u2019s security operatives and innocent citizens and destroyed public and private property deserved to be punished, not compensated for their criminal acts.\n\nLeaked report not Govt White Paper \u2013 Panel member\n\nWhile being featured on a live TV programme in Lagos, a private solicitor who represented the interest of Lagos State Government at the panel along with his colleagues, Abiodun Jelili Owonikoko (SAN), said that by law, the decisions, recommendations, resolutions of the panel were not meant for public consumption in the first instance, but to be reviewed by the government before releasing it to the public.\n\nHe quickly clarified that even the government\u2019s decision on it, which comes by way of White Paper, is not binding on anybody that is aggrieved. And, concerned persons were entitled to subject it to the judicial review in a court of law.\n\n\u201cI am totally shocked about what I read to be the report, particularly the finding with regards to 40-something victims, some of whom were described as deceased, some of them described as missing but all attributed by the panel to what is called the Lekki incident. My opinion here is based on my first-hand information and involvement in the proceedings and the record that we have.\u201d\n\nWhen Owonikoko was told that the youth representative at the panel had already confirmed the authenticity of the report circulating online except for some typographical errors, he expressed his shock at a member of the panel already discussing the content of the report on a national TV against the oath of fidelity, impartiality, and confidentiality guiding the activities of the panel. \u201cI cannot be part of those who would justify extra-judicial killings or abuse of state power,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the evidence that we were able to gather at the hearing, there was not a single thing that was established.\n\n\u201cI am not speaking for Lagos State Government. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t pretend not to be aware that certain documents have been circulating in the social media. I have seen one of such reports. It is unsigned, but it contains the names of all members and I did not, on going through it, see any indication that it was not a unanimous position. It may well be, however, that it is a draft of a minority opinion, because giving what I know, having spent one whole year from beginning of the sitting of the panel till the end, except for occasions where one or two of my colleagues had to stand in for me, we have the record of proceedings.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that some members of the panel had personal interest, which he said defiled the goal of submitting an objective and neutral report. He accused certain members of the panel of being in the habit of consistently taking to the social media to share their pre-informed opinions on the issues being investigated. He described such acts as being in sharp contrast to every goal the panel originally set out to achieve.\n\n\u201cThe mistake I observe now that the government made was that there should have been a different panel entirely to look into the Lekki incident. The panel that was constituted originally was meant to address victims and abuse of police brutality and SARS. There was no single member of the panel who had a personal case that he wanted to establish. There was no reason we should be afraid that anybody there would have a pre-conceived notion or a settled position that they were going to be opened to being persuaded by evidence-led.\n\n\u201cBut in the course of that panel\u2019s work, this incident happened, but this incident had protagonists and antagonists. Unfortunately, at least, three members of the panel were picked from those who were protagonists of the case against the police that people like us also represent. I was fully in support of what was going on up until October 20, even up until the night, until I became wiser the next morning when I did my enquiry. Those members are ordinarily not entitled to sit in this panel. But they are members of this panel where we were trying to establish who were killed, at Lekki Tollgate, whether Lekki Tollgate Concession Company withdrew camera to suppress information. This is the case they have been making on their own even before the panel sat. So from the very beginning, that panel lacks the judicial competence to determine this issue.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he didn\u2019t raise the alarm about the contention while the sittings were on, than waiting for the report which now seems unfavourable to the Lagos State Government, Owonikoko said that the duty of Lagos State Government, the burden on them was to establish whether they were the ones that deployed Army to the scene or not. According to him, the evidence before the panel and the finding did not support such a suggestion. He said that was the only thing Lagos State had to explain.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nThere is a palpable feeling of despondency across the length and breadth of the South East over the people\u2019s condition in the Nigerian federation as presently constituted. Though several people are in sync with the agitation of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and other similar separatist groups for an independent state of Biafra, the apex Igbo sociocultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has been insistent on dialogue that would translate to the restructuring of Nigeria.\n\nTo Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the agitation and youth restiveness in the South East of Nigeria is simply a reaction or an effect or the consequences of an orchestrated alienation by the Federal Government over the years.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAccording to the group, until some of the issues of obvious injustice against the Igbo are seen to be addressed, the chains of catastrophe that threaten the corporate existence of Nigeria may well-nigh be inevitable.\n\n\u201cAsk any Igbo any day, all he wants is a sense of belonging in a country anchored on equity, justice and fairness,\u201d Ohanaeze maintained.\n\nNoting that it is extremely difficult to have peace amidst injustice, President General of Ohanaeze, George Obiozor, recently emphatically declared: \u201cWe need not look elsewhere to know that IPOB is simply an exponent of Igbo collective sentiments and predicaments in our tortuous journey and an unquantifiable sacrifice for one Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonnia, also advanced similar thoughts recently.\n\nIn a speech entitled: \u201cIf Zik were alive,\u201d delivered at the Second Igbo Nsukka Zik Annual Merit Award 2021 held at Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre, Abuja on Wednesday, and with the theme: \u201cPreserving Zik\u2019s legacies for national unity,\u201d Ogbonnia identified the case of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu as the most intricate and complex challenge to the Igbo at present.\n\nSpeaking at the event organised by the Igbo Nsukka United Front in honour of the first President of Nigeria, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Ohanaeze spokesman called Kanu a persuasive visionary charismatic leader whose followership was catholic, saying that the agitation for Biafra that he leads has inadvertently become the opium of the Igbo masses.\n\n\u201cLike most visionaries, Kanu has identified the various ills in the Nigerian society and how the Igbo are victimized in the process. He has raised the awareness and consciousness of the Igbo youth that anybody against Kanu is considered either an oppressor or an agent of the oppressors. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has also created a vision with a strongly held assurance of how the new Biafra will look like; an Eldorado of abundance, affluence, communalism, love, joy and happiness. And as in Christian or Islamic religion, the adherents are prepared to deprive themselves the enjoyment the contemporary world provides in an anticipation of the fullness of joy in the life hereafter. As in religion, martyrdom becomes a stronger visa for the benefits thereafter. Therefore, Biafra has inadvertently become the opium of the Igbo masses. It must therefore be appreciated that Nnamdi Kanu has become a phenomenon,\u201d Ogbonnia asserted.\n\nTwo leading Igbo groups- the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), yesterday, gave further insight into why the agitation for an independent state for the Igbo may not die soon.\n\nAccording to the ADF, the crisis of the Nigerian federation has reached a stage where many Igbo are getting convinced that the only fundamental solution lies in the attainment of sovereignty as an independent republic under the African Union.\n\nChairman, Media and Publicity Bureau of ADF, Abia Onyike who stated this in a position paper in Enugu, noted that the difference between ADF and apex Yoruba sociocultural organisation, Afenifere is that Afenifere advocates restructuring of the Nigerian federation along regional lines but \u201cwe believe that only the transformation of the ethnic nationalities into autonomous republics can resolve the crises of the artificial federation.\u201d\n\nADF said there was the need for Ndigbo to enjoy the maximum benefits of national sovereignty, which the Hausa-Fulani hegemons have blocked since 1960.\n\nOnyike argued that only a sovereign nationhood can permit Igbo civilization to blossom and not to be drawn back because of the unfavourable political relationship between them and their neighbours in the chaotic and crisis-ridden Nigerian federation. He said: \u201cNigeria is a federation of divided people. The British created Nigeria as an omnibus state to frustrate Igbo advancement in world affairs.\n\n\u201cWe live in a generation globally where what is prevalent is the formation of organic states as distinct from empire states. The organic state is one in which the people have a common language and a common culture with minor variations. Examples abound. From 1989 to date, over 25 new countries (states) have emerged from Asia, Europe and Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, the UN passed a resolution making it legal and democratic for ethnic nationalities to exercise their rights to self-determination. Igbo nation is a major or mega nationality and has all it takes to stand as an independent republic away from the violence, crises and perpetual uncertainties of Nigeria\u2019s failed and artificial federation.\n\n\u201cThe crises of the Nigerian federation can only be resolved through the proper understanding of the facts raised above.\u201d\n\nAlso, COSEYL said that the youths in Igbo land would continue to agitate for self-determination unless the Federal Government addressed the lingering marginalisation of the zone.\n\nPresident General of the group, Goodluck Ibem particularly frowned at the non-inclusion of Igbo in strategic federal appointments.\n\nHe catalogued some of the grievances of the Igbo thus: \u201cThe Federal Government marginalises the people of South East in various ways and forms. For instance, no South East son or daughter is a Service Chief or a member of the Security Council. The list of how and where Igbo are marginalised by the present government is endless.\n\n\u201cYoung Igbo graduates who are eminently qualified to be employed or to occupy some positions of authority in federal government ministries, parastatals and agencies are not employed or given the opportunity to even sit for exams or attend interviews. Round pegs are used in square holes, which has been drawing us back as a country.\n\n\u201cThe security agents deployed to the South East zone kill young and vibrant Igbo youth arbitrarily without any provocation whatsoever. The security agents paid with taxpayers\u2019 money intimidate, harass, detain and dehumanize Igbo youths without any reason to do so.\n\n\u201cThese mindless harassment and intimidation make youths to want to opt out of the country since they are no longer needed in a country they belong.\n\n\u201cArmy, police, Navy and other security roadblocks have become a point where security agents brazenly extort from motorists, tricycle and motorcycle riders. There are uncountable roadblocks on South East roads.\n\n\u201cThese roadblocks make life difficult, unbearable and living hell for our youths who make a living through business. The worst aspect of the extortion by security agents in South East is that they kill at will whosoever that fails or refuses to give them bribe and will openly declare before the hearing of everyone that \u2018I will kill you and nothing will happen\u2019.\n\n\u201cSadly, Igbo youths who refused to pay bribes have been extra-judicially killed by these security agents deployed on our roads and those involved have not been prosecuted or brought to justice for crimes against humanity. It is very sad.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is not building infrastructures in South East the way it is building in other geo-political zones. The Federal Government has built double-gauge rail system in other zones and even to our neighbouring country, Niger Republic but none has been built or even awarded in South East zone. We have been really relegated to the background by this present government.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

Ibem added that in the judiciary, the federal government had systematically removed people from South East from the roll of judges so that no Igbo man or woman will emerge as Chief of Justice of Nigeria.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

But he assured that he would consider it. Buhari gave the assurance when he received a group under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, at State House, Abuja.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari stressed that the request runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nThe President told the 93-year-old statesman: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious. In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the judiciary, President Buhari said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Chief Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace. The nonagenarian had described the situation in the South-East as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that businesses have collapsed, education is crumbling, and there is fear everywhere.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying,\u201d stressing that he could control him, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nOther people in the visiting delegation were Chukwuemeka Ezeife, former Governor of Anambra State, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, and Mr Tagbo Mbazulike Amaechi.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2018You\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious\u2026 But the demand you made is heavy, I will consider it\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThough, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared that an unconditional release of the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, currently standing trial for treason, runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers, and that such a demand was quite heavy, nonetheless, he said he would consider the plea for amnesty for him.\n\nA group of Igbo elders, under the aegis of \u201cHighly Respected Igbo Greats,\u201d led by First Republic parliamentarian and minister of aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, requested the amnesty for Kanu, during a visit to Buhari at the State House, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nWhile receiving the delegation, led by the 93 year-old statesman, Buhari said: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201cIn the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with a very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy, I will consider it.\u201d\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, the President said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and was brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from the outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian had described the situation in the Southeast as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that \u201cbusinesses have collapsed, education is crumbling amid a reign of fear.\u201d\n\nAmaechi pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that he could control him, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with IPOB, but I am highly respected in Igboland today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr. President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Igbo Great\u2019s delegation were former Governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, Goddy Uwazurike and Tagbo Amaechi.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "IMF Urges Nigeria to Fully Remove Fuel Subsidies Early 2022",
          "text": "* Wants implementation of cost-reflective electricity tariffs from next January\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nContrary to the federal government\u2019s plan to remove subsidy on petrol in the second half of next year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised the Nigerian government to fully remove fuel subsidy and move to a market-based pricing mechanism in early 2022 as stipulated in the 2021 Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nThe IMF, in its 2021 Article IV Mission statement released yesterday also projected that despite high oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit would widen in 2021 to 6.3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nFiscal deficit is projected at 3.93 per cent and 3.39 per cent of GDP in Nigeria\u2019s 2021 and 2022 budgets respectively.\n\nThe IMF, in the report said: \u201cThe complete removal of regressive fuel and electricity subsidies is a near-term priority, combined with adequate compensatory measures for the poor.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the implementation of cost-reflective electricity tariffs as of January 2022 should not be delayed. Well-targeted social assistance will be needed to cushion any negative impacts on the poor particularly in light of still elevated inflation.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s past experiences with fuel subsidy removal, which have all been short-lived and reversed, underscore the importance of building a consensus and improving public trust regarding the protection of the poor and efficient and transparent use of the saved rsources.\u201d\n\nThe IMF observed that there were significant downside risks to the near-term fiscal outlook from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, weak security situation and spending pressures associated with the electoral cycle.\n\nAccording to the IMF, over the medium term, without bold revenue mobilisation efforts, fiscal deficits are projected to stay elevated above the pre-pandemic levels with public debt increasing to 43 per cent in 2026.\n\nIt stated: \u201cWith the emergence of fuel subsidies and slow progress on revenue mobilisation, the fiscal outlook faces significant risks. Continued reliance on administrative measures to address persistent foreign exchange shortages is negatively impacting confidence.\u201d\n\nThe IMF observed that the Nigerian economy \u201cis recovering\u201d from a historic downturn benefiting from government policy support, rising oil prices and international financial assistance.\n\nIt noted that the Nigerian authorities\u2019 pro-active approach had contained the COVID-19 infection rates and fatalities, adding that with the emergence of fuel subsidies and slow progress on revenue mobilisation, the fiscal outlook faces significant risks.\n\nIMF said: \u201cThe economy is recovering from a historic downturn. Helped by government policy support, rebounding oil prices and international financial aid, Nigeria exited the recession in 2020 Q4, earlier than expected. Output rose by 5.4 per cent (y-o-y) in the second quarter, mainly reflecting base effects from transport and trade sectors and continued strong growth in the IT sector.\n\n\u201cHowever, manufacturing and oil sectors remain weak, reflecting continued foreign exchange shortages, and security and technical challenges. Headline inflation rose sharply during the pandemic reaching a peak of 18.2 per cent y-o-y in March 2021 but has since declined helped by the new harvest season and opening of the land borders.\n\n\u201cReported unemployment rates are yet to come down although COVID-19 monthly surveys show the employment level to be back at its pre-pandemic level.\n\nNoting that the outlook is for a subdued recovery, the IMF observed that while Nigeria\u2019s real GDP is projected to grow by 2.6 per cent this year and continue in the range of 2.6-2.7 per cent per annum over the medium term, \u201cthis is just above the population growth rate implying stagnant per capita income in the medium term.\u201d\n\nDespite an ease in food prices, it said inflation is projected to remain in double-digits, in the absence of monetary policy reforms.\n\nIt also alluded to significant downside risks to the near-term outlook arising from the uncertain course of the pandemic and the domestic security situation, in the medium term.\n\nIt added that there were upside risks from faster-than-expected reaching of the Dangote refinery\u2019s production capacity along with effective implementation of the 2021 Petroleum Industry Act in terms of higher manufacturing production and investment in the oil sector.\n\nIMF called for major reforms in fiscal, exchange rate, trade and governance to alter what it described as \u201cthe long-running lackluster growth path.\u201d\n\nThe IMF listed near-term priorities for Nigeria to include the implementation of e-customs reforms, including efficient procedures and controls, developing a Value Added Tax (VAT) compliance improvement programme, improving compliance across large, medium, and micro/small taxpayers and rationalising tax incentives and customs duty waivers. the recent passage of the PIA and stressed its timely implementation.\n\nIt stated that preliminary assessments by the IMF and the World Bank suggest that the approved fiscal terms would provide greater incentives to invest in the oil and gas industry but would reduce the fiscal take from new and converted fields.\n\nOn exchange rate policy, the IMF called for reduced administrative measures and room for a market-clearing unified exchange rate.\n\nIt also endorsed steps taken toward unification of the exchange rate and stressed the need for further actions.\n\nThe Fund stated: \u201cThe discontinuation of the official exchange rate is a step in the right direction, but continued dependence on administrative measures to address FX shortages sustains uncertainties and increases the risks of a sudden and large adjustment in the exchange rate.\n\n\u201cTo preserve competitiveness, any exchange rate adjustment should be accompanied by clear communications regarding exchange rate policy going forward, macroeconomic policies to contain inflation and structural policies to facilitate new investment.\n\n\u201cA further move toward a market-clearing exchange rate will also help build foreign exchange buffers through higher capital inflows.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "text": "The management of an insurance corporation, Leadway Assurance Company has denied defrauding an Abuja-based man, Jolayemi Woleola.\n\nWoleola had accused the insurance corporation of fraud involving over multi-million naira claims on his damaged vehicle.\n\nHe described the attitude and disposition of the company to his insurance claim as appalling, disappointing, annoying and frustrating.\n\n\"I entered into a vehicle insurance contract with Leadway covering my Mercedes Benz E 300 2017 model. The insured car was involved in an accident with a trailer on Kubwa express in Abuja on 23/07/2021,\u201d he had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\"I presented my claim to Leadway after relevant documents like the police report were issued. The Leadway insurance has maliciously refused to reinstate me to the position I was in prior to the accident.\n\n\"Leadway has been coming up with excuses including outright lies to refuse the fulfilment of their obligation towards me.\n\n\"Leadway started from questioning the veracity of an accident which threatened my life to outright lies of claiming to visit the hospital where I was treated of bleeding and being told no patient was treated on that day to twisting outright glaring facts as to the value of the vehicle prior to insuring same.\u201d\n\nReacting in a letter signed by its Head of Legal Services Department, Sunday Oroleke to SaharaReporters, the company said it was shocked by the allegation of \u201cfraudulent intent\u201d made by Woleola and thereby rebutted it.\n\nLeadway said the insured rejected a settlement offer of N3,711,955.09 and demanded N13,443,982.77 for a vehicle he claimed to have bought for N15,000,000.00.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cOur attention has been brought to a publication by Sahara Reporters regarding an allegation by one of our customers, Mr. Jolayemi Woleola (insured), that we fraudulently denied his motor vehicle insurance claim.\n\n\"We are shocked by the allegation of 'fraudulent intent' made by the insured and hereby rebut it all. We value this responsibility and hereby tender the facts of the claim for clarity:\n\n\u201cWe confirm that Mr. Jolayemi Woleola is the holder of a comprehensive motor insurance policy with our company on his Mercedes Benz with registration number RBC 123 BL. He insured his vehicle for the sum of Fifteen Million Naira (N15,000,000.00) and the policy was effective 26th April, 2021 upon payment of Three Hundred and Seventy-Five Thousand Naira (N375,000.00) being the total premium on the policy.\n\n\u201cOn the 7th of June, 2021, barely two (2) months from the inception of the policy, the insured lodged a claim for a damage to the windscreen and front headlight of the insured vehicle and submitted a quotation of Three Million, Six Hundred and Sixty- Nine Thousand, Two Hundred and Seventy-Four Naira, Ninety-Three Kobo (N3,669,274.93). Upon receipt of the claim, we engaged an independent loss adjuster who adjusted the claim to One Million, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira (N1, 250,000.00). The insured accepted our settlement offer and we paid the adjusted sum to the insured on the 24th June, 2021.\n\n\u201cOn the 13th of August, 2021, barely two months after the initial claim and about four months into the policy, the insured lodged another claim following an accident involving the same insured vehicle which he stated that he rammed into a moving trailer. He presented a quotation of Thirteen Million, Four Hundred and Forty-Three Thousand, Nine Hundred and Eighty-Two Naira, Seventy-Seven Kobo (N13,443,982.77) being the cost of repair of his Mercedes Benz E300. As usual, we engaged an independent loss adjuster who adjusted the claim to Three Million, Seven Hundred and Sixty-Nine Thousand, Nine Hundred and Forty-One Naira, Fifty- Six Kobo (N3,769,941.56).\n\n\u201cOn the 10th of September, we communicated a formal net offer of the sum of Three Million, Seven Hundred and Eleven Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-Five Naira, Nine Kobo (N3,711,955.09) and forwarded discharge form for cash in lieu of repairs, given that the insured appeared to want to write off the vehicle despite it being repairable.\n\n\u201cThe Insured rejected our offer, insisting that we should settle him on the basis of the sum insured which is contrary to the insurance principle of indemnity as we would be putting the insured in a position far better than he was immediately before the accident.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with standard policy terms, an insurance company can either 'repair, reinstate, or replace' the damaged vehicle. The choice is solely dependent on the professional assessment of the extent of damage. It is also worthy to note that where an accident results in a loss with repair value in excess of 55% of the Sum Insured Value of the vehicle, it is treated as a 'constructive total loss', entitling the insurer to pay for replacement of the vehicle and the possession of the salvage (i.e., the damaged insured vehicle). In this case, the cost of repair was 25.1% of the Sum Insured Value of N15m, which is far less than 55%.\n\n\u201cThe demand and insistence of the insured to claim full value of the insured vehicle appeared to be fraudulent, leading us to investigate why he wants to profit from insurance, particularly after the first accident with a similarly inflated claim that we allowed despite our reservations about it.\n\nSee Also Business Customer Accuses Leadway Assurance Company Of Fraud Over Multi-million Naira Claims On Damaged Vehicle\n\n\u201cIn the course of our investigation, we discovered that the insured had purchased the vehicle as an accident vehicle via auction with primary damage to the front end, secondary damage to the right front and other internal issues which the insured had fraudulently concealed from the insurer at the point of taking up the policy.\n\n\u201cFrom the second accident, the insured in his quotation included some vehicle parts which had been damaged at the time he purchased the accident vehicle and prior to the second accident claimed by him. Rather than deny his second claim altogether, we accepted the dodgy fact of a moving trailer, superficial injury following this moving trailer story and still made an offer on parts that could have been damaged, assuming his story to be true.\n\nPlease note that we remain reputable for our payment of genuine claims and hold ourselves to high standards of best practices.\n\n\u201cThis is evident in Mr. Jolayemi Woleola\u2019s claim that was settled earlier in the year and our net offer of Three Million, Seven Hundred and Eleven Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-Five Naira, Nine Kobo (N3,711,955.09) less policy deductions, being the independently adjusted cost of repairs for his alleged damaged vehicle from an accident with a moving trailer.\n\n\u201cWe kindly request that you retract your publication by publishing our facts and also circulate to counter the fraudulent use of your media in an attempt to blackmail us on an entitlement that is not due to the insured. This would also help in educating and enlightening the public on insurance matters.\u201d",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis, and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad, or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria, is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole, than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in app integrations. But, as none of these payment aps are widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalaskasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller micro transactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest growing economies in sub-saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Shuttlers raises $1.6 million to expand to Nigerian cities",
          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this article will be made public on November 23, by noon (WAT)..

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas.

Emmanuel Paul has that answer and more here: Led by ex-OPay exec, Kredi Money wants to be the one-stop-shop for payments, loans, insurance, other financial services.\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Pays, CEO and Co-Founder of Ozow\n\nSouth African fintech startup, Ozow has closed a $48 million Series B to ease online payments for South Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, The funding was led by Tencent, a Chinese Internet-based company. Other investors, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund, also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Ozow do? The startup makes it possible to pay online with bank transfers or manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) without using your bank app.\n\nHow? It\u2019s called automated EFT; it works just like a payment gateway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen making an online payment, customers choose Ozow as a payment option, select a bank, log in with online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment.\n\nMerchants, on the other hand, only need an account number and smartphone to receive payments.\n\nOzow\u2019s CEO, Thomas Pays, says he started the company in 2014 to create a \u201ccentral platform that could basically provide solutions to eCommerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, Pays says, seven years ago, digital payment was very fragmented,\n\n\u201cif I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my eCommerce site, I need to go to a PayU.\u201d\n\nOzow plans to use the funding to expand its team from 100 to 250. A part of it will also be geared towards expansion into Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nAccording to Statista, the blockchain technology market is currently valued at $6.92 billion. That value is expected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027. This means that as the market grows, the demand for blockchain talent will also increase.\n\nIn light of this, African crypto exchange, Bitmama, is launching Bitmama Credits Programme to support young people globally with the skills needed to get a career in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe programme will begin in the first quarter of next year, offering blockchain learning materials and internships.\n\nThe big picture: With the advent of several blockchain innovations such as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing.\n\nIn 2019, the demand for blockchain jobs increased by 300% from the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, high demand also means huge salaries. The average salary for a blockchain developer is between $150,000 and $175,000; that\u2019s approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers.\n\nWhy\u2019s there so much demand?: According to 101 Blockchains, the need for blockchain talent is fueled by the advantages of blockchain, such as security, transparency, and traceability.\n\nWith more innovations coming out of the space, the demand for blockchain talent is bound to increase.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nGoogle\u2019s Next $1 Trillion Opportunity.

          "text": "Why I can\u2019t act on #ENDSARS reports now \u2013 Buhari\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday declined to make a categorical statement on the report that indicts the Nigerian Army over the killing of #ENDSARS protesters at the Leki toll gate, Lagos, saying that the Federal Government will allow the system to exhaust itself. This is just as the United States government on Thursday insisted that the Nigerian government must be transparent and should insist on providing justice, in handling the #ENDSARS report. The American Secretary of State, Antony Blinken described the report of the EndSARS probe panel as \u201cdemocracy in action,\u201d stressing that America equally had its own police brutality, and hoped that necessary reforms would be made. \u201cWe are hoping that there will be transparency and accountability on the part of the government and provide justice to victims of the attack.\u201d But President Buhari, while speaking at State House, Abuja, at an audience with the United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said his government \u201cwill wait for pronouncements from state governments which set up panels to probe police brutality in the country.\u201d He disclosed that \u201c So many state governments are involved, and have given different terms of reference to the probe panels,\u201d adding that \u201cWe at the Federal have to wait for the steps taken by the states, and we have to allow the system to work. We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. The Federal Government has to wait for the reaction of the states.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP slows to 4.03% in Q3\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy maintained a positive growth trajectory in the third quarter of 2021, recording a 4.03percent growth. But the reported growth is slower than the massive 5.01percent GDP recorded in the previous quarter, indicating that the base effect from last year may be waning. This is the fourth quarter of positive growth since the 2020 recession which was exacerbated by the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on Africa\u2019s largest economy. Output had contracted by -6.10percent and -3.62percent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the Covid pandemic. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which announced the new GDP numbers in its latest report on Thursday said the Q3 2021 growth rate was higher than the -3.62percent growth rate recorded in Q3 2020 by 7.65percent points but lower than 5.01percent recorded in Q2 2021 by 0.98percent points, indicative of a continuous recovery. \u201cNevertheless, quarter on quarter, real GDP grew at 11.07percent in Q3 2021 compared to Q2 2021, reflecting a higher economic activity than the preceding quarter.\u201d\n\nRead also: POS usage rises 91% in three years as Nigerians embrace agent banking\n\nMo Abudu\u2019s business becomes Harvard case study\n\nMo Abudu, the CEO of EbonyLife Group, is known for several firsts in the media space, and is adding another feather to her hat. For the first time in history, a case study about a female African media entrepreneur titled: \u2018The Harvard Business School \u2013 EbonyLife Case Study,\u2019 will be taught at Harvard Business School (HBS) to over 1,000 MBA students. \u201cEbonyLife turns 10 next year, so the case reflects on how we started and where we are today. It will also highlight our challenges along the way,\u201d Abudu said. She revealed in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay that she is currently on the HBS campus in Boston where this case study will be taught, and also to share her story with the students and faculty. What this means is that, first-year students at HBS will study a case about an African company, led by a Nigerian woman. It will become one of approximately 500 case studies read by students over the course of the two-year MBA programme. Nearly half of these cases are based on global organisations. \u201cI am looking forward to listening to them and answering their questions. I am humbled and honoured to be chosen for this, and I will always do all I can to encourage everyone out there on the possibilities and results that abound in daring to excel, because as I always say, if you can think it, you can do it,\u201d Abudu said.\n\nIHS buys MTN\u2019s towers, becomes largest asset owner in SA\n\nIHS Towers has signed agreements to acquire MTN\u2019s 5,709 towers in South Africa to make it the largest independent telecom asset operator in the country in a deal worth $412 million. The tower operator is entering the South African market for the first time. The agreement also sees IHS Towers provide Power-as-a-Service (PaaS) to MTN at approximately 12,800 sites across South Africa (including the acquired 5,709 sites). That means IHS will own 70 percent of the South African towers business with the remaining 30 percent owned by a Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) consortium. IHS Towers said it is in advanced talks with a consortium of B-BBEE investors and hopes to complete it soon. B-BBEE is an integration programme launched by the South African government to reconcile South Africans and address the inequalities of apartheid by attempting to compensate for land that was repossessed from Africans.\n\n\u201cOur long-standing relationship with MTN Group, coupled with our two decades of operation on the African continent and track record of delivering consistently strong network uptime, will enable us to deliver an infrastructure capable of meeting South Africa\u2019s increasingly sophisticated data demands. Although we have expanded into new regions over the last two years, this agreement is a testament to our continued commitment to facilitating mobile connectivity across the African continent. With this Transaction and our partnership with the Egypt Digital Company for Investment as announced last month, IHS now has a footprint in seven African markets, in addition to our four newer markets in Latam and MENA.\u201d\n\nReal estate emerges world\u2019s most popular store of wealth\n\nTwo-thirds of global net worth is stored in real estate and only about 20 percent in other fixed assets, according to consulting firm, McKinsey. A recent report by the New York-based company states that the high share of countries\u2019 wealth that is stored in the property market raises questions about whether societies store their wealth productively. Breakdown of the report reveals that the value of residential real estate amounted to almost half of global net worth in 2020, while corporate and government buildings and land accounted for an additional 20 percent. Global net wealth jumped to $514 trillion in 2020, rising by $358 trillion from 2000 levels, according to a McKinsey report cited by Bloomberg. \u201cWe are now wealthier than we have ever been,\u201d Jan Mischke, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute in Zurich, told Bloomberg in an interview. Assets that drive much of economic growth include infrastructure, industrial structures, machinery and equipment; intangibles \u2013 as well as inventories and mineral reserves make up the rest. On why most countries store a large part of their wealth in real estate, McKinsey cites the product of high quantity and quality of housing, high construction costs relative to other prices in the economy, or high land prices. The trend has been consistent since 2000. \u201cGrowth in household real estate wealth stemmed from rising home prices, with the cost of land and construction also increasing,\u201d it states.\n\nFG warns against inappropriate use of antimicrobials in food production\n\nThe Federal government through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has warned against the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, pesticides in food production and preservation, stating that it causes the spread of resistant infection. Speaking during the flag-off ceremony to commemorate the \u20182021 World Antimicrobial Awareness Week\u2019 in Abuja on Thursday, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar said that promotion of good practices in the sector would help fight against resistant infections. According to him, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in recent times has been considered one of the most important threats to public health in all parts of the world as it drastically limits the ability to effectively treat common infections in humans and animals. He said, \u201cit has been projected that by 2050, AMR could account for up to 10 million deaths annually, and about 4million of these deaths (representing 40percent) are likely to occur in Africa. \u201cAMR occurs when the disease agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, no longer respond to the action of antimicrobials which are hitherto susceptible. \u201cWithin the agricultural and food resources sectors, a critical factor that promotes anti-microbial resistance is the slaughter, sale and consumption of animals treated with antimicrobials without observance of the withdrawal period. The result is the presence of residues in foods of animal origin such as meat, fish, eggs and milk.\u201d",

The implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201d In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary.\n\n\u201d God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory.\n\n\u201dA lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nWhile etressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, President Buhari said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system.\n\n\u201dLet him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe president condoled with Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian had described the situation in the Southeast as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that \u201dbusinesses have collapsed, education is crumbling, and there is fear everywhere\u201d.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister still alive, \u201che would no longer say the things he had been saying\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that he could control Kanu, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said twice he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa.\n\n\u201dMr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire.\u201d\n\nOthers in the visiting delegation were; Chukwuemeka Ezeife, former Governor of Anambra, Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, and Mr Tagbo Amaechi.\n\n...",

Our diversity is often misconstrued to be the source of our challenges, but I feel if properly harnessed, it will be the source of our greatness,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\n\u201cOne good way to make progress in this regard is to strengthen government institutions to improve integration, equity and social inclusion in our various nations.\n\n\u201cLet me affirm that the weapons of our warfare in times like this should be love, justice and hope. The pursuit of these virtues will guarantee sustainable peace and unity in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhile guns, drones and other artilleries may win the war, to win the peace we need to constantly engage in meaningful conversations in order to reach compromise on issues, affecting us all.\n\nLawan moves again zoning, says president can come from anywhere\n\nSpeaking at the event, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said lack of said trust among political leaders was creating tension in the country, noting that it was also responsible for the many challenges bedevilling the nation.\n\nLawan argued that rotational presidency as being strongly being advocated in many quarters is unnecessary, as according to him, what Nigeria needs is a \u201cleader that will give sense to the people and provide everything within the constraint of resources.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President said lack of mutual trust between North and South was constituting a clog on the wheel of the country\u2019s progress, advising that Nigerians shun mutual distrust for necessary progress.\n\n\u201cWhen we have a marriage and there is mutual suspicion between the parties, that means the marriage may begin to suffer a bit. What we need is to be open as leaders to all manners of people. And we shouldn\u2019t allow suspicion among us because when political leaders allow for suspicion among themselves, the outcome is that the ethnic nationalities will behave the same way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur major problem is the suspicion between the different ethnic groups. Otherwise, why will someone bother where the president comes from? Let the president come from anywhere but what we need is leadership that will give sense to the people and provide everything within the constraint of resources that the people need. But when we suspect each other, that is when people crawl back to their ethnic enclaves.\u201d\n\nLawan said leaders must continue to unite and engage one another to make the country a better place, as according to him, the country could be great if the political class decides to be selfless and honest.\n\nHe described Jonathan as a man with abundant traits of humility, fairness, equity and justice, adding that, \u201cwhat you are doing as a former president is to show an example of what our leaders can do outside of the office.\u201d\n\nLawan said of Jonathan, \u201cYou are a man of peace because you believe in Nigeria and the unity of this country.\n\n\u201cAfter you left office in 2015, you decided to work for the unity of this country and its leadership to ensure that the country remains united. You are a unifier and we believe you mean well for this country.\n\n\u201cWhen you were in office, I was in the opposition but I supported many of your policies and opposed some. My belief is that you have demonstrated very clearly that this country can be great.\u201d",

The implication of your request is very serious. In the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already. But the demand you made is heavy. I will consider it.\u201d\n\nThe President, while emphasising his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nBuhari commiserated with Chief Amaechi, who recently buried his wife, praying that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nThe nonagenarian, who earlier described the situation in the South East as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d said businesses had collapsed, education was crumbling, and there was fear everywhere.",

He is telling me that he wants justice. Please the media should help us get justice for my brother.\n\n\u201cThe real killers should come out. I got two conflicting reports. AIT was saying something and SWAT was saying something else. People are calling me from my village and the US, UK, they do not believe the story.\n\n\u201cThere is a video circulating that Tordue was packed in a bag, because of that I do not eat, any time they give me food, I will tell them that it is like they butchered my brother.\n\n\u201cI want justice. This can happen to anybody if we ignore this, tomorrow whoever killed him, if that person is not brought to book he will do it again to another person because he or she was not caught.\n\n\u201cWe want justice for the sake of his little daughter so that his spirit can go and rest. I am not accusing anyone, but I do not believe anything that was shown to us on television.\n\n\u201cFor the police spokesman saying we identified the corpse when we have not seen it, I do not know why he made that statement,\u201d she said.\n\nTordue\u2019s in-law, Dr. Jeffrey Kuraun, said the family was not convinced that the body at the Wuse General Hospital mortuary is that of Tordue, saying the police authorities must provide answers to nagging questions and ensure that justice is served.\n\nHe said the family would wait and allow the police to conclude their investigation though they had no formal brief from the police on the matter except the press conference where the purported hit-and-run driver was paraded.\n\nKuraun also urged the media to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death.\n\n\u201cDo not be in the category of people where someone will say, \u201cLet them talk after a while, everything will die down. As a family, do we believe the story? No, we do not. It could be true but we do not. Why? Do more to clarify certain things. Formally we have not been informed. Maybe the formal information is the press conference and I respect that. We take that as formal information concerning this issue.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the mortuary, we saw the body but we were not convinced it was his body, although the body frame looked like him but the legs were completely gone, twisted and messed up.\n\n\u201cSo he does not even have legs. He is a tall guy but I did not see that. I was trying to look at the face; I just need answers,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also expressed displeasure at the way Vanguard Newspapers broke the news of the death without prior notice to the family.\n\nHe expressed regret that the police hurriedly announced at the press conference that the family had positively identified the body while they were on their way to the Wuse General Hospital mortuary.",

          "text": "Despite police reports that Mr. Tordue Saleem, a former reporter of Vanguard Newspapers who went missing for a month was killed by a hit and run driver, the family is still calling for justice.\n\nThe family members who doubt the report of the police concerning the death said the body discovered by the police did not look like Tordue.\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Kuraun, an elder sister of the late Tordue, while speaking with our reporter, said her brother was always telling her that he wanted justice.\n\nAccording to her, when she is sleeping, she sees Tordue, and cannot sleep.\n\n\u201cI am depressed. He is telling me that he wants justice. Please the media should help us get justice for my brother.\n\n\u201cThe real killers should come out. I got two conflicting reports. AIT was saying something and SWAT was saying something else. People are calling me from my village and the US, UK, they do not believe the story.\n\n\u201cThere is a video circulating that Tordue was packed in a bag, because of that I do not eat, any time they give me food, I will tell them that it is like they butchered my brother.\n\n\u201cI want justice. This can happen to anybody if we ignore this, tomorrow whoever killed him, if that person is not brought to book he will do it again to another person because he or she was not caught.\n\n\u201cWe want justice for the sake of his little daughter so that his spirit can go and rest. I am not accusing anyone, but I do not believe anything that was shown to us on television.\n\n\u201cFor the police spokesman saying we identified the corpse when we have not seen it, I do not know why he made that statement,\u201d she said.\n\nTordue\u2019s in-law, Dr. Jeffrey Kuraun, said the family was not convinced that the body at the Wuse General Hospital mortuary is that of Tordue, saying the police authorities must provide answers to nagging questions and ensure that justice is served.\n\nHe said the family would wait and allow the police to conclude their investigation though they had no formal brief from the police on the matter except the press conference where the purported hit-and-run driver was paraded.\n\nKuraun also urged the media to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death.\n\n\u201cDo not be in the category of people where someone will say, \u201cLet them talk after a while, everything will die down. As a family, do we believe the story? No, we do not. It could be true but we do not. Why? Do more to clarify certain things. Formally we have not been informed. Maybe the formal information is the press conference and I respect that. We take that as formal information concerning this issue.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the mortuary, we saw the body but we were not convinced it was his body, although the body frame looked like him but the legs were completely gone, twisted and messed up.\n\n\u201cSo he does not even have legs. He is a tall guy but I did not see that. I was trying to look at the face; I just need answers,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also expressed displeasure at the way Vanguard Newspapers broke the news of the death without prior notice to the family.\n\nHe expressed regret that the police hurriedly announced at the press conference that the family had positively identified the body while they were on their way to the Wuse General Hospital mortuary.",

          "title": "Mkpuru Mmiri: The dangerous drug destroying Igbo youths",
          "text": "MANY Igbo communities are currently facing the dangerous effect of Methamphetamine nicknamed by the youths as Nkpuru Mmiri which translates to seed of water.\n\nMany youths are into it but God knows that seeds of water cannot be dangerous drugs. Picture of the drug probably informed it\u2019s nickname.\n\nMkpuru mmiri is a crystal narcotic hallucinogen that is capable of destroying a person mentally. It is estimated that 75 percent of the users in our society are adversely affected. And they have become a burden to their families and communities.\n\nAccording to drug literature, methamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system. The crystal form of the drug looks like glass fragments and is chemically similar to amphetamine, a drug used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.\n\nAddicts can take methamphetamine by smoking, swallowing, snorting or injecting the powder that has been dissolved in water or alcohol. The \u201chigh\u201d from the drug starts and fades quickly, people often take repeated doses in a \u201cbinge and crash\u201d pattern. In some cases, people take methamphetamine as a \u201crun,\u201d giving up food and sleep while continuing to take the drug every few hours for up to several days.\n\nMethamphetamine affects the brain adversely. It increases the amount of a natural chemical called dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in body movement, motivation, and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors.\n\nThe drug\u2019s ability to rapidly release high levels of dopamine in reward areas of the brain strongly reinforces drug-taking behaviour, making the user want to repeat the experience.\n\nTaking even small amounts of methamphetamine can result in the same health effects as taking cocaine or amphetamines. These include increased wakefulness and physical activity, decreased appetite, faster breathing, rapid and/or irregular heartbeat and increased blood pressure and body temperature.\n\nSeveral questions concerning this scourge are in the public domain. One of the questions is whether Nkpuru Mmiri is sourced locally or imported into the country. Another question is, if it is imported, from which of the nation\u2019s boundaries did they come in? If it is locally produced, where in Nigeria is it produced?.\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement headed by Buba Marwa yesterday tried to answer these questions in their reaction which contained some details about the drug. The agency, through their spokesman, Femi Babafemi, sent the following as their reaction:\n\n\u201cMkpulu Mmiri is the Igbo slang for Methamphetamine or Crystal Meth, a very dangerous illicit drug. It looks like Ice or white chalk crystal and sometimes can be blue. That is why the users sometimes refer to it as \u201cice.\u201d It can be dissolved in water.\n\nIt was developed in Japan in 1919 and grossly abused during World War II when it was issued to pilots on a suicidal mission called \u201ckamikaze.\u201d After the world war, it was briefly used as a medication for depression and for controlling obesity, but it was quickly abandoned and banned thereafter, especially from the 1970s. Meth is categorised as Schedule II (i.e. \u201cdrugs with a high potential for abuse, with use potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence\u201d) by the International Drug Control Conventions.\n\nSince the 1990s, the production of crystal meth has been hijacked by Mexican drug cartels and they came into Nigeria to set up laboratories in 2016.\n\nIt is a very addictive stimulant that renders the user hyperactive and prone to destructive tendencies which at the extreme do not exclude suicide or homicide at the slightest provocation and without a feeling of remorse.\n\nAs a stimulant, it has powerful euphoric effects, similar to those of cocaine. Meth typically keeps users awake, depriving them of sleep. Its use and abuse also carry acute health risks including high blood pressure and cardiovascular-related illness.\n\nAside from being unable to sleep and being violent, users exhibit anti-social behaviours arising from paranoia and hallucination. The drug takes a toll on the physical look of its users. It typically makes them look older and their faces prone to acne. Sometimes, excessive use leads to damaged gum and teeth, commonly called \u201cmeth mouth.\u201d\n\nWhat is most frightening is that meth addiction is one of the most difficult to treat, because no drug can cure it, except by behavioural therapy, which at the moment is not readily available in the country.\n\nSince the launch of the Offensive Action campaign early this year, NDLEA has recorded significant seizures of kilograms of the drug. Likewise, the Agency has located and destroyed not less than 18 meth-producing laboratories in the country in the past few years.\n\nThe Agency has been monitoring the trend in Meth production, abuse and trafficking. And because of the rampant abuse and production of the drug, especially in the Southeast, the Chairman/CEO recently gave specific instructions to relevant directorates of the Agency on how the Agency should respond to the development. You can be rest assured that in a matter of time, the pipelines of such illicit drugs would be shut down and those behind it brought to book.\u201d\n\nHow Mkpuru Mmiri became popular in the Southeast of the country is still a mystery, although there were reports that barons form well organized cartels and distribution network are responsible for this drug destroying the brains of our youths.\n\nLike wildfire, the effect of Nkpuru Mmiri has spread across most towns and even remote villages. It was even suspected that the hard drug contributed in no small measure to the problem of the unknown gunmen in parts of the South East in recent time, particularly in Anambra State before the recent governorship election in the state. Some people actually believe that only people who take such drugs could be killing people and destroying property without any provocation and without showing remorse.\n\nIn Anambra State, for instance, the drug has become a house hold name in such communities like Obosi, Enugwu Ukwu, Agukwu, Agulu, Okija, Uli, Awka, Nteje, Awkuzu, Umueri, Umudioka and many more. In the communities where Nkpuru Mmiri has become common, rape has also become rampant as it is believed that the drug increases the libido of the affected youths. Another surprising thing is that some women also indulge in it and, in their case, the result is usually madness.\n\nCurrently, some communities have started identifying those who sell the drug in their areas and are banishing them, while their youths who were known to be taking it are publicly punished by flogging them in village squares.\n\nFor instance, the Umudioka Improvement Union in Dunukofia local government area of Anambra State has proscribed the sale and consumption of all illicit drugs and substances in the community and warned those still undertaking such business to desist forthwith as they stood the risk of being arrested and prosecuted with the support of the relevant security agencies.\n\nIn Okija, Ihiala local government area, youths of the community early this week marched through the major roads to drive home their full commitment towards eradicating the menace of cultism which is linked to drug abuse, particularly Mkp\u00fbr\u00fb mmiri in the town. Some stakeholders from the town joined in the campaign during which they warned that anyone found guilty would be seriously dealt with. Several communities have also taken similar measures, but it is left to be seen how effective the measures would be in the coming weeks.\n\nEven NYSC orientation camps are not spared of the hard drug.. Recently, there was a startling revelation by one of the coordinators of the National Youth Service Corps, in one of the states that many Youth Corps members are into the hard drug.During an interaction with some prospective employers, the NYSC coordinator said: \u201cAs a matter of fact, when we are going to the orientation camp, we take so many collaborative agencies, including NDLEA, counselors and other people who help talk to the youths that are really into drugs. But I never knew that the TomTom (sweet) they put inside Coca-Cola makes them high. I never knew that when they hold a Lacaserra bottle, you won\u2019t know that the content is not Lacaserra. Even known seasoning cubes that you and I use in cooking, these children will put it inside Lacasera, drink it and they are high.\n\n\u201cWe keep telling them that if they are into drugs, they should drop it outside before entering the orientation camp within three weeks, and once they could achieve that, they could live a normal life. Unfortunately many of them still smuggle the drugs into the camps\u201d.\n\nMr. Ugezu Ugezu, a popular Nollywood actor and film producer said it has been discovered that many Igbo youths are unfortunately neck deep into it. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know how it found its way into our space. I suspect that it is possible that those who want to destroy our future brought it into our state and our youths are unfortunately embracing it. In many Igbo communities today, unemployed youths and some artisans have made Nkpurumiri their companion. After taking it, they see themselves as being on top of the world\u201d, he said.\n\nProffering a solution to the problem, Ugezu said: \u201cThe Presidents General of the various town unions should, as a matter of urgency tackle this problem of Nkpurumiri headlong. I strongly believe that the menace can be reduced by flogging mercilessly those who indulge in it. Some communities have already started doing that and we commend them. In the olden days, those who were possessed by demons were freed by flogging the evil spirit out of them. If our forefathers could succeed then, I see this Nkpurumiri as a small case.\n\nIf we allow this dangerous situation to prevail in our society, then the future of our country is doomed because this crop of youths will eventually occupy the political space and I wonder how a society they lead will be like.\n\nAlso, various families should identify such youths in their midst and report them to the town union leadership. If this is not done in the next three to four years, most youths would have been completely destroyed.\n\nBut another concerned person, Mrs. Ujunwa Okoli had a different opinion when she told a pathetic story concerning her sibling. She said: \u201cHere in Anambra, Mkpuru mmiri situation is very critical. My town is flogging them and this is not the best, My younger brother, our only son died last week from the flogging. My brother was never a bad child but suddenly he started hanging out with rough youths and now he is dead. He could have been saved if he was not flogged. After the flogging he became sick and died three days later. I suggest that rather than flog them, they should be rehabilitated.\n\nThe resurgence of drug addiction among the youths today is unarguably of grave concern, which, perhaps, is why many communities are outraged over the destructive effects of the scourge among young people. The good news, however, is that most of the communities are united in the battle against it. Usually punitive measures such as public flogging and pledge of abstinence by offenders are currently being recommended and applied.\n\nThe situation is alarming \u2013 Anambra govt\n\nReacting on the effect of this drugs on the youths, the Anambra State government described it as alarming. The state Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C Don Adinuba said government would soon interface with the stakeholders to find a lasting solution to the problem.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis extremely potent illegal drug is destroying our youths. Government is alarmed at its consequences which include serious health crisis that often leads to death. The state government is working together with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, the police and community leaders, including traditional rulers, town union leaders and youth organizations to wipe out this new phenomenon. We shall also soon visit schools and youth organizations to spread the message of the dangers of this menace\u201d. Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s announcement that he will examine the petition of some Southeast leaders to free Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has elicited mixed reactions.\n\nDuring a meeting with Buhari at the State House in Abuja, Southeast leaders under the auspices of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic politician and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, appealed for Kanu\u2019s release.\n\nInstead of resorting to military force, Amaechi called with the president to pursue political solutions in Kanu\u2019s issue.\n\nBuhari, who pledged to review their petition, responded by stating that Kanu\u2019s unconditional release would be in violation of the idea of separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary.\n\nThe president also emphasized his non-interference approach with the judiciary.\n\nHowever, a constitutional lawyer, Maduabuchi Idam, contested the president\u2019s claim that ordering Kanu\u2019s release would constitute meddling with the judiciary.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s assertion, Idam noted that the Nigerian constitution allows Buhari to order Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami to drop the prosecution against Kanu.\n\nThe Abuja-based lawyer told DAILY POST that the president might order Malami to withdraw any cases against anyone, including the IPOB leader, in the national good.\n\nAccording to Idam: \u201cKindly note that if an offence is alleged to have been committed, it is the state that prosecutes the alleged offender. In this context, the state is the Presidency and that is why it is the office of the Attorney General of the Federation that prosecutes Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and those of his members on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, by virtue of Section 174 (1),(c) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as Amended, the AGF has the constitutional power to amongst others, enter a \u201cnulle prosecui\u201d ( power to discontinue a case) in favour of any person being prosecuted for any offence on behalf of the Federal Government. Similarly, the power is also available to the AG of the State with respect to State offences. See Section 211 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, the President of Nigeria, in the interest of the public, can direct the AGF to withdraw any case that is instituted against any one on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cBy the operation of the said provision of the constitution, the AGF has the vires to personally or through an officer in his office, walk into the court where Mr. Kanu is undergoing prosecution and apply to withdraw the charges against him and his members, and the court has no power under the constitution or any law, to refuse the Application or demand the AGF to give an explanation for that.\n\n\u201cIf the President feels that a matter should be withdrawn from the court for public interest, all he needs to do is to direct the AGF to do the needful.\n\n\u201cI must say that I commend the courage of Mr. President for the first time, at least for saying that he will consider the request to release the IPOB Leader, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and his members.\u201d\n\nIdam\u2019s remark was, however, countered by a Northern socio-political activist, Yaro Abdullahi, who warned on the dangers of releasing Kanu.\n\nAbdullahi warned that Kanu\u2019s release may serve as a spring board for other people to commit serious crimes and get away with it.\n\nHe pointed out that nobody in the history of Nigeria has committed Kanu\u2019s kind of crime; hence releasing him would be sending the wrong message.\n\n\u201cHow do you start considering the release of a criminal like Kanu, who ordered killing of people. Because of his criminal style of agitation, the Southeast is no longer peaceful, releasing him would be sending the wrong signal that people can just do anything and get away with it.\n\n\u201cThis is my view. The president should allow the judiciary to do their work and not listen to all those appeals. If the courts find him guilty, he should face the music and if it\u2019s the other way round, he should be released.\n\n\u201cThe president, while considering should also note the damage Kanu is capable of doing if set free,\u201d he told DAILY POST.",

God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Even In Death, Itunnu Babalola Must Get Justice, Says Dabiri-Erewa\n\nAn unconditional release of Kanu who is the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and currently standing trial, according to the President, runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, he said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested and was brought back to the country, \u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system.\n\n\u201cLet him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside. I feel it\u2019s even a favour to give him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe President condoled with Amaechi who recently buried his wife and prayed that her soul would rest in peace.\n\nIn his remarks, Amaechi had described the situation in the South East as \u201cpainful and pathetic,\u201d lamenting that businesses have collapsed, education was crumbling, fear has begun to manifest everywhere.\n\nHe pleaded for a political, rather than military solution, requesting that if Kanu was released to him as the only First Republic Minister alive, \u201che (Kanu) would no longer say the things he had been saying.\u201d\n\nThe former minister promised to control Kanu, \u201cnot because I have anything to do with them (IPOB), but I am highly respected in Igbo land today.\u201d\n\nHe stated that he had interfaced with Nnamdi Kanu in the past twice, and the latter rescinded orders earlier given on civil disobedience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this planet without peace returning to my country. I believe in one big, united Nigeria, a force in Africa. Mr President, I want you to be remembered as a person who saw Nigeria burning, and you quenched the fire,\u201d Amaechi told his host.\n\nOther people in the visiting delegation were former Anambra State Governor, Chukwuemeka Ezeife; Bishop Sunday Onuoha of the Methodist Church, former President of Igbo socio-cultural group, Aka Ikenga, Goddy Uwazurike; and Mr Tagbo Amaechi.\n\nKanu was first arrested in 2015 on charges bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms, and improper importation of goods, among others.\n\nHe was initially detained and arraigned in court, but he fled the country in 2017 after he was granted bail for medical reasons.\n\nThe embattled IPOB leader was later sighted in Israel, but he was intercepted on June 27 and repatriated to Nigeria to face the charges for which he was arrested \u2013 about four years since he jumped bail.\n\nHis repatriation followed an operation conducted by Nigerian security operatives in collaboration with international partners.\n\nOn July 26, Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja adjourned the trial of Kanu until October 21 after the DSS failed to produce him in court.\n\nShe faulted the action of the security outfit and asked the prosecution to be diligent with dates whenever she gives one, stressing that it was important for Kanu to be present at his trial.\n\nThe judge had also made an order for regimented access to the defendant but declined the proposal of Kanu\u2019s counsel that he should be transferred to a correctional centre.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe United States government believes now is the time for major geopolitical players across the world to start treating Africa as one of them.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State, Mr Antony Blinken, stated this on Friday while addressing members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abuja.\n\n\u201cUnited States firmly believes that it is time to start treating Africa as a subject in geopolitics, and structure it as a major geopolitical player it has become \u2013 the facts speak for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Even In Death, Itunnu Babalola Must Get Justice, Says Dabiri-Erewa\n\nSpeaking specifically about Nigeria, the U.S. official highlighted some of the reasons it would not be out of place to call the nation the giant of Africa.\n\nAmong several other qualities, he noted Nigeria\u2019s cultural influence, saying people across the world listen to the Afrobeat music genre and watch Nollywood movies. He, however, believes there are areas that require improvements.\n\n\u201dYour strengths are undeniable \u2013 a dynamic democracy, a robust economy, and a very powerful civil society. Challenges you face here are undeniable as well, including the disruption and insecurity caused by terrorism,\u201d said Blinken.\n\n\u201cWhat happens here in Nigeria is felt around the world, and that, in a nutshell, is why I came to Abuja. United States knows that in most of the challenges and opportunities we face, Africa will make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t achieve our goals around the world \u2013 whether ending the COVID-19 pandemic, building a strong and inclusive global economy, combating the climate crisis\u2026 without the leadership of the African governments, institutions, and citizens.\n\n\u201cCountries like Nigeria, not just global leaders, they are increasingly prominent around the world beyond this region, and they are deserving a permanent seat wherever the most consequential issues are discussed.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Backsliding\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of State stressed the need to foster democracy across the African continent and appealed to its leaders to stop interfering with democratic processes.\n\nAlluding to the threats to democracy also in the U.S., he stated that it was important for countries in every part of the world to share best practices.\n\nBlinken also asked them to make public pledges to hold each other accountable, as well as show how democracy can deliver what citizens want quickly and effectively.\n\nHe explained that boosting democracy was one of the major reasons why U.S. President Joe Biden would host a democratic summit in December.\n\n\u201cThe recession of democracy in many places in Africa cannot be denied, and it is not the will of the people,\u201d the U.S. official decried. \u201cSurvey after survey in countries across the continent show that the people of Africa \u2013 either Ghanaian, or Zambian, or Ugandan, or Tanzanian \u2013 support democracy when given the choice between multi-party elections or strong man rule, one-party state or military control; they choose multi-party elections.\n\n\u201cThat makes it more important that leaders show leadership and stop democratic backsliding that is wiping away their citizens\u2019 aspirations. I want to emphasise that democratic backsliding is not just an African problem, it is a global problem.\n\n\u201cMy own country is struggling with threats to democracy and the solutions to those threats will come as much from Africa as from anywhere.\u201d",

The criminals attacked the town in the early hours of this morning through multiple flanks with unconfirmed number of ISWAP foot soldiers on Gun Trucks. They were, however subdued by the overwhelming fire power of the vigilant troops.\n\n\u201cIn the following offensive, troops engaged the terrorists with high volume of fire, forcing them to withdraw in disarray. Though, the actual number of casualty could not be immediately ascertained as at the time of this release, however blood stains were reportedly seen on the terrorists\u2019 withdrawal routes.\n\n\u201cThis latest operational feat, attests to the continuous combat readiness and troops renewed vigor to effectively deny these criminal elements freedom of action. Additionally, this clearly signifies the resolve of the good people of the North East who have chosen to take ownership of the ongoing counter insurgency operations by providing credible information on the cladestine activities of the criminals.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya salutes the gallantry displayed by troops, while urging them across all theatres of operations to sustain the current operational tempo.\u201d",

          "text": "The UN and the United States on Friday demanded proof of Peng Shuai\u2019s whereabouts, amid rising concern for the Chinese tennis star\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nThe player has not been seen in public since alleging on November 2 that she was sexually assaulted by China\u2019s former vice-premier.\n\nTennis stars, sports bodies, governments and human rights defenders have all spoken up in support of the 35 year old who said in a now-deleted Weibo post that Zhang Gaoli had forced her to have sex.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden\u2019s administration wanted China to \u201cprovide independent, verifiable proof\u201d of Peng\u2019s whereabouts and expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the former world top-ranked doubles player.\n\nThe United Nations has insisted on a fully transparent investigation into Peng\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cIt would be important to have proof of her whereabouts and wellbeing,\u201d Liz Throssell, a spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office, told reporters in Geneva. \u201cWe are calling for an investigation with full transparency into her allegation of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nTennis players including Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic, the world\u2019s top men\u2019s player, have also voiced their support for the Chinese athlete.\n\n\u201cThis is horrifying. I mean, a person is missing,\u201d Djokovic said at the ATP Finals in the Italian city of Turin. \u201cThe whole tennis community needs to back her up and her family and make sure that she is safe and sound.\u201d\n\nDjokovic also backed the Women\u2019s Tennis Association\u2019s (WTA) statement that it was prepared to cut lucrative business ties with China over Peng.\n\n\u201cIf you have tournaments on Chinese soil without resolving this situation it would be a little bit strange, so I understand why the WTA has taken a stance like that,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\nThe former Wimbledon and French Open doubles champion alleged that Zhang, who retired in 2018, had \u201cforced\u201d her to have sex during a long-term on-off relationship.\n\nChina has remained largely silent over the tennis star and on Friday the Foreign Ministry stuck to its line that it was not aware of the controversy surrounding the player.\n\nMinistry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that the matter was \u201cnot a diplomatic question and I\u2019m not aware of the situation.\u201d\n\nPeng\u2019s post was quickly deleted from her verified account on Weibo, China\u2019s popular social media platform, although screenshots of the accusation were shared widely. Discussion of the case has since been suppressed, with state broadcaster CGTN this week sharing an email purportedly from Peng to WTA chief Steve Simon saying that she was \u201cresting\u201d at home and the assault allegation was \u201cnot true\u201d.\n\nSimon has questioned the authenticity of the email, and on Friday said the WTA was at a \u201ccrossroads\u201d with China and continuing all efforts to reach out and speak to Peng directly.\n\nPeng, who represented China in the Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro Olympics, is not the first high profile Chinese citizen to suddenly disappear from public view in unclear circumstances.\n\nJack Ma, the founder of the world\u2019s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba, went missing in October 2020 after criticising government regulators in a speech. Shortly afterwards, a significant share sale by Ant Group, the group\u2019s online payments unit, was pulled by the authorities at the last minute. Ma re-emerged in a video in January this year, but did not mention his disappearance.\n\nFan Bingbing, a Hollywood actress who was a prolific social media user, disappeared for three months in 2018. It later emerged that she was kept under house arrest while she was investigated for tax evasion.\n\nPeng\u2019s claims brought the #MeToo movement into the highest echelons of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government has systematically silenced the country\u2019s #MeToo movement,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s China researcher Doriane Lau.\n\n\u201cGiven that it also has a zero-tolerance approach to criticism, it is deeply concerning that Peng Shuai appears to be missing,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden has said he is angry after a teenager who shot dead two men during racial unrest last year in Wisconsin was cleared by a court.\n\nThe president expressed dismay at the verdict in a written statement although earlier he said he stood by the jury.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, 18, sobbed as he was acquitted of all charges over the shooting in Kenosha on 25 August 2020.\n\nThere were low-key protests over the outcome of the trial that has divided the US.\n\nMr Rittenhouse had acknowledged fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and injuring Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, but maintained he did so in self-defence.\n\nThe former police youth cadet was cleared of two counts of intentional homicide, one count of attempted homicide and two counts of recklessly endangering safety.\n\nMr Rittenhouse appeared to nearly collapse with relief as he learned his fate on Friday from a jury of seven women and five men after three-and-a-half days of deliberations. His mother, Wendy, also wept.\n\nThe defendant and the men he shot were all white, but the issue of race hung over the case because the shooting happened during civil disorder over perceived police brutality.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s election campaign, Mr Biden tweeted a video that appeared to link Rittenhouse, without any evidence, to white supremacists.\n\nOn Friday outside the White House a reporter asked the Democratic president whether he stood by his past comments about the teenager.\n\nMr Biden said he had only just heard the news and added: \u201cI stand by what the jury has concluded. The jury system works and we have to abide by it.\u201d\n\nHe later released a statement saying: \u201cWhile the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken.\u201d\n\nMr Rittenhouse, then 17, had showed up in Kenosha after the city had been convulsed by two nights of rioting, looting and arson when police shot a black man, Jacob Blake, seven times in the back on 23 August 2020, leaving him partially paralysed.\n\nThe defence presented their client as a civic-minded teenager who had gone to the Midwestern US city to protect private property and only shot the men because he was in fear of his life.\n\nThe prosecution had depicted Mr Rittenhouse as a reckless vigilante and the men he shot as heroes attempting to disarm someone they thought was an \u201cactive shooter\u201d.\n\nThe trial heard that Mr Rosenbaum had been acting erratically that night and chased Mr Rittenhouse before trying to grab his gun. Mr Rittenhouse fatally shot him.\n\nMr Huber was then killed after striking Mr Rittenhouse in the head or neck with a skateboard.\n\nMr Grosskreutz had his bicep shot off after pointing his own gun at Mr Rittenhouse.\n\nAfter the verdict, Mr Rittenhouse\u2019s defence attorney Mark Richards said of his client: \u201cHe wants to get on with his life.\n\n\u201cHe wishes none of this ever happened. But as he said when he testified, he did not start this.\u201d\n\nThe parents of Huber, the second person shot, said they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the verdict.\n\n\u201cIt sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street,\u201d Karen Bloom and John Huber said in a statement.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Nomia Iqbal in Kenosha said a small number of protesters gathered outside the court, holding signs that read \u201cKiller Kyle,\u201d and \u201cNo justice no peace.\u201d\n\nLocal store owners told her they would be glad once the verdict was announced so that the city could move forward.\n\nThe trial exposed political divisions, with many Democrats condemning the verdict while Republicans said justice had been served, with some even offering him internships.\n\nFollowing the verdict, right-wing Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted a clip of an exclusive interview with Mr Rittenhouse, to be broadcast on Monday.\n\nIn the footage, Mr Rittenhouse describes waking up in a cold sweat because of \u201cscary\u201d dreams he has every night about what happened.",
