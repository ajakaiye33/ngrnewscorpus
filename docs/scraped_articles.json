          "text": "\u2022Melinda and husband, Bill Gates\n\nBy Jimoh Babatunde\n\nStrive Masiyiwa, Baroness Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, Thomas J. Tierney, and Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman have been appointed as members of the board of trustees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThey will be joining co-chairs Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates as members.\n\nAnnouncing the appointment in the the foundation\u2019s inaugural annual letter, Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman , said the board members will work alongside Gates and French Gates, bringing independent and diverse perspectives to help strengthen the foundation\u2019s governance.\n\nThe letter highlights the foundation\u2019s efforts to fight poverty and disease; its goal of creating a better, fairer world; and its commitment to listening to diverse perspectives and deepening engagement with partners and communities where its work is focused.\n\nREAD ALSOOhanaeze reacts to Rep rejection of state Police\n\n\u201cWe are honored that these three deeply knowledgeable and respected individuals have agreed to join the foundation board,\u201d writes Suzman. \u201cBetween them, they bring an incredible track record of impact across global business, philanthropy, and development, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to work with them.\u201d\n\nIn addition to introducing the new board members, Suzman discusses the foundation\u2019s efforts to maximize its impact while ensuring that its work is increasingly inclusive.\n\nThat includes deepening engagement with developing country agencies and governments, establishing offices and growing its staff outside of the United States, and expanding grants to institutions closer to affected communities. He also emphasizes that in its next phase, the foundation will continue to prioritize areas where its resources and expertise will be most catalytic and to invest in higher-risk areas where it\u2019s more difficult to deploy public resources, from funding innovative treatments for malaria to supporting cutting-edge disease modeling.\n\n\u201cOur new board members are strong, qualified leaders who will support the foundation and its partners in our work to promote a healthier, safer, more equal world for all. I am deeply proud of all that we have accomplished over the past two decades and energized to work with them to drive progress on some of the most important issues the world faces today,\u201d said Melinda French Gates.\n\nSuzman and Connie Collingsworth, the foundation\u2019s chief operating officer and chief legal officer, led the work to strengthen the foundation\u2019s governance at Gates\u2019 and French Gates\u2019 request, conducting a strategic review in consultation with external experts on best governance practices.\n\nThe new board members will bring their diverse expertise, experience, and perspective to advise the co-chairs and the foundation\u2019s leadership team on budget and strategy. The board will meet three times a year to guide the work of the foundation and approve the annual budget and four-year plan. They will also have the responsibility to review the CEO\u2019s performance and approve the CEO\u2019s compensation. Board members serve three-year terms, with a two-consecutive-term limit.\n\n\u201cOver the past 20 years, the scale and scope of our foundation\u2019s work has evolved to include some of the most complex and urgent challenges the world faces,\u201d said Bill Gates.\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead, I\u2019m excited to welcome our new board members. Their wide-ranging experience and expertise will have enormous impact on our ability to tackle the complexity of these challenges and bring us closer to realizing a world where everyone has the chance to lead a healthy and productive life.\u201d\n\nThe board announcement comes at a time of unprecedented global challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed, halted, and even reversed hard-won gains in global health and development around the world.\n\nAfter nearly two decades of steady progress, tens of millions of people have been thrown back into poverty, childhood vaccination rates have dropped, and diseases from malaria to tuberculosis have resurged.\n\nSince January 2020, the Gates Foundation has committed more than $2 billion to the global COVID-19 response, with a focus on making sure support reaches marginalized communities as quickly and effectively as possible. The pandemic has had devastating impacts on these communities, and it will take many years for them to recover.\n\nThis governance change comes after the death in late 2020 of Bill Gates Sr., Bill Gates\u2019 father, an honorary co-chair, and a long-time guiding voice at the foundation, as well as the decision by Warren Buffett last year to step down as a trustee after nearly 15 years.\n\nIt also represents an explicit recognition by Gates and French Gates, especially in the wake of their recent divorce, that the foundation will be well served by the addition of independent voices to help shape its work in the future.\n\nThe board could include up to nine total members, with conversations ongoing about adding to the initial slate to enhance representation across gender, geography, and expertise.\n\nSpeaking on his appointment, Strive Masiyiwa, chairman and founder of Econet Group, said: \u201cOver the last 20 years I have worked with the Gates Foundation, beginning with efforts to improve agricultural production for more than 400 million smallholder farmers in Africa, to improving livelihoods for the poorest people across Africa and the world. We have worked together to address global health crises like the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics. I am honored to join the co-chairs and the incredible team at the foundation in fighting disease and poverty throughout the world.\u201d\n\nAlso, Baroness Shafik, director of the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: \u201cI am honored and delighted to be joining the board of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and I look forward to working with my fellow board members to support its mission of advancing human flourishing. I\u2019ve spent my career working in some of the world\u2019s great international and academic institutions because, like Melinda and Bill, I realize that the hardest problems facing humanity are not confined to a single country or sector, but are universal challenges that call for reason, empathy, and cooperation. I\u2019ve long admired the foundation for standing for those values across borders and all parts of society. The pandemic, climate change, and other crises have shown its work to be more relevant and necessary than ever. I will dedicate my service as a board member to upholding those collaborative values within an organization that exists to enable everyone to live a healthy and productive life.\u201d\n\nSince its establishment 21 years ago, the foundation has provided more than $60 billion in grants, with the annual payout regularly increasing year over year. With a more than $50 billion endowment; Gates and French Gates\u2019 additional commitment of $15 billion last year; the expectation of future pledges, and the requirement to spend down the endowment after the co-founders\u2019 deaths, the foundation is uniquely positioned to continue its work of fighting poverty, disease, and inequity in the United States and around the world, while maintaining a major role in the field of philanthropy for decades to come.",

          "text": "\u2026MC Oluomo has not declared interest \u2013 Aide\n\nBy Evelyn Usman\n\nChairman of the Oshodi Tapa Chieftaincy family in Lagos State, Chief Moroof-Deen Babatunde, today, said the family has not endorsed anyone as the traditional ruler of Oshodi.\n\nThere were speculations that the Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, in Lagos State, Mr Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly called MC Oluomo, was to be installed as the Oba of Oshodi.\n\nAddressing journalists on the family\u2019s position, Chief Babatunde said: \u201cThe record we are trying to put straight is that this family house: Oshodi Tapa chieftaincy family , is the absolute owner and controller of Oshodi town in Oshodi/Isolo Local Government Area .\n\n\u201cWe have not endorsed anybody to be Oba. We have not even called for candidature as I speak. We therefore, take report of Musiliu Akinsanya alias MC Oluomo\u2019s moves to be Oba of Oshodi as a rumor because he is not a member of the Oshopdi Tappa chieftaincy family and has no right to the stool of Oshodi town.\n\n\u201cWe have already instituted a case in the court, we have made an advertorial that has been published and we have also written to the government\u201d.\n\nHe stated that the territory in question included expanse of land stretching from Matori, Mafoluku,OgunOloko stream canal,Sogunle, Alasia border by the Railway line otherwise known as Onigbogbo, warning that any claim to any part of the land by any individual , group of association , outside the Oshodi Tapa family was null and void .\n\nHe traced ownership of the area to a judgment delivered by a High Court Judge on April 19,1960, and was also affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nigeria on March 5,1963 , as well as the Supreme Court after another challenge on it , on July 14,200.\n\nAside from the suspected move by Oluomo to be installed as the Oba of Oshodi, he disclosed that \u201cthere is an outstanding issue which is the upgrading of the baleship to Oba in Oshodi. We went to the tribunal but we have not seen its report. Unfortunately, another segment of people I don\u2019t know, got the report and went and asked the government to come and install somebody in Oshodi\u201d\n\nHe clarified that \u201c several centuries ago, our ancestor, Chief Tapa Oshodi was given this land in recognition of his military prowess and assistance to the Onigbesa of Igbesaland during the era of the Slave Trade .The land gift was a gesture of appreciation by the Onigbesa, who was the original owner of this area from time immemorial and it has been in our possession since, not as customary tenants but as absolute owners. The Onigbesa gifted us the land without conditions.\n\n\u201cFrom the late 1950s, there had been several attempts by rancorous elements claiming to be related to Onigbesa, to violate this agreement. But such attempts to subvert our inheritance had failed\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the Oshodi Tapa family had not taken any steps to install anybody as traditional ruler of the area because of an existing case, part of which he attributed to silence on the part of the government.\n\nChief Babatunde said, \u201cGovernment is a part of the case. Let the government say something . if they want to come to court, let them come and talk, if they want to go to the press, let them say something\u201d.\n\nWhen contacted to know if MC Oluomo had interest in the oshodi obaship stool and to ascertain if he was a member o f the Oshodi Tapa family, his Personal Assistant, Jimoh Buhari, replied, \u201c Number one, he (Oluomo) has come out publicly to declare his intention for the Oshodi Obaship stool. Perhaps the rumor broke out when he tried to make consultations.\n\n\u201cSecondly , it is normal to have a divided view among families if anyone signifies interest in ascending a stool . Some of the family embraced him while others didn\u2019t . it is normal\u201d.",

They were both burnt beyond recognition in the inferno.\n\nDelta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, who was at the scene of the incident with his entourage, lamented the devastating consequences of the fire and immediately directed some top government functionaries to work with the firefighters to quench the fire still raging as at the time of filing this report.\n\nThe governor who was more concerned about the tank loaded with gas that was still lying on the ground urged the fire fighting team attacked to Ughelli unit to mobilise more water and equipment that would contain the smoke still coming from the petrol tanker close to the gas truck in order to forestall further disaster in the area.\n\nNarrating the incident to Daily Sun, which was at the scene of the incident, Ohoror community chairman Mr Igometi Augustine said he got a distressed call on the incident at 2 am and immediately rushed out to the scene.\n\nHe disclosed that on inquiry he was reliably informed that the three (3) tankers convening gas, diesel and petrol were trying to overtake each other and along the line, the one carrying petrol hit a stationed truck with granite and they both fell leading to the fall of the other two tankers coming from behind them.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United States Government has renewed its support for the fight against trafficking in persons in the country.\n\nThe US Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission, Kathleen FitzGibbon, gave the assurance while speaking during the 2022 commemoration of the National Human Trafficking Awareness Month in Abuja.\n\nThe event was organised in collaboration with Devatop Center for African Development with the theme: \u201cImproving Awareness on Human Trafficking and Increasing Reportage of Cases.\u201d\n\nFitzGibbon recalled that from 2002 to 2004, she was fortunate to be a member of the then-newly created Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the United States Department of State.\n\nThe multi-disciplinary office which she said has grown exponentially, according to FitzGibbon, is a sign of the importance the United States Government places on combating modern-day slavery.\n\nFitzGibbon also recalled her opportunity to work closely with the Federal Government on legislation and the creation of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).\n\nShe stated that deepening partnerships with a broad array of stakeholders inside and outside of government was critical to bolstering Nigeria\u2019s anti-trafficking and anti-smuggling efforts.\n\n\u2018It, therefore, warms my heart to see this diverse group of people joining together to work towards the same goal.\n\n\u2018Human trafficking has no place in a society that values freedom and the rule of law. For that reason, the United States stands with Nigeria in its fight against trafficking,\u2019 FitzGibbon said.\n\nFitzGibbon disclosed that the United States Government funds anti-trafficking efforts in Nigeria through its multilateral partners such as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nShe added that through its partners, the United States work to strengthen NAPTIP\u2019s capacity to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons cases and enhance cooperation between NAPTIP and key stakeholders at the state level.\n\n\u2018This built upon a program hosted in Lagos last March, where we worked to bring Nigerian judicial officers, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials together to focus on improving the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking cases and discussed the admissibility of electronic evidence in human trafficking cases under Nigerian law.\n\n\u2018Another US-funded program strengthens coordination among civil law enforcement agencies and community structures to support timely, accountable prevention and technical capacity to facilitate response services. This 24-month project focuses on improving access to direct response services for the crisis-affected populations, as well as on continuing to build the capacity of the NPF, the NSCDC, and NAPTIP to prevent and respond to Gender-Based Violence and Trafficking in persons in Kaduna, Niger and Plateau States.\n\n\u2018The USAID-funded Strengthening Civil Advocacy and Local Engagement project, or SCALE, is working with local NGOs to engage with diverse segments of society, such as the business community, religious leaders, and traditional rulers, to address human trafficking in their respective fields. SCALE also works with local authorities and Nigeria\u2019s nongovernmental coalition working towards tackling human trafficking, the Network Against Child Trafficking. Abuse and Labour, to improve the regulatory framework to arrest and prosecute the human traffickers that cause so much misery,\u2019 FitzGibbon also said.\n\nWhile saying that human trafficking is a global problem to which no one country or society is immune, FitzGibbon also said there is the need for a wide range of partners dedicated to ending human trafficking such as the Nigerian government, civil society, and other foreign governments.\n\n\u2018No one entity can end human trafficking alone \u2014 we must work together,\u2019 FitzGibbon added.\n\nFitzGibbon further called on the anti-traffickers to be even more coordinated within their respective governments and with their non-governmental organisations partners to defeat the traffickers.\n\n\u2018The victims of human trafficking and smuggling deserve no less. I hope you are as proud as I am that through the combination of the TALKAM App\u2019s technical innovation with the training of community leaders in Niger, Kaduna, and the FCT, that together we are increasing reporting and support for victims,\u2019 FitzGibbon stated.\n\nOn her part, the Director-General of NAPTIP, Fatima Waziri-Azi, hailed Devatop Centre for African Development for the initiative.\n\nWaziri-Azi who was represented by the Chief Intelligence Officer, Public Enlightenment Department, NAPTIP Headquarters, Abuja, Roseline Abare, added that the Talkam Human Rights Project is a valuable initiative, especially as it focuses on combatting human trafficking and human rights abuse.",

          "text": "\u2022Orders refund to state\n\n\u2022It\u2019s victory for democracy, says Wike\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court yesterday declared as illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional the direct allocations made by the federal government from the federation account to fund the Nigeria Police Trust Fund. Mohammed barred the federal government from further deductions from the federation account to fund agencies not listed in the 1999 Constitution for direct allocation.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, stated that the judgement was a resounding victory for democracy.\n\nThe court, in the judgment, held that Section 161 and Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution were glaringly breached by the federal government following the direct allocation from the federation account to the Police Trust Fund.\n\nThe suit challenging the continued deductions from the federation account to fund agencies belonging to the federal government was filed by the Rivers State Government.\n\nDelivering judgement, the court held that Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution was clear and unambiguous to the effect that only the federal, states and local governments shall be allocated fund directly from the federation account.\n\nThe court also held that Section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the federal government to justify the unlawful deductions from the federation account was inconsistent with section 162 of the 1999 Constitution which recognises only the federal, states and local governments.\n\nMohammed, while upholding the suit by Rivers State against the deductions, ordered that the fund belonging to Rivers State but used to fund the Nigeria Police Trust fund by the federal government should be refunded to the state.\n\nThe judge, however, declined to extend similar order of refund to the 35 remaining states on the grounds that they were not parties in the suit, adding that Rivers State, as the plaintiff in this matter, did not file it on behalf of others.\n\nThe court upheld all arguments of Joseph Daudu, who stood for Rivers State, that where the provisions of the 1999 Constitution are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their ordinary meanings.\n\nMohammed also agreed with Daudu that the federal government was completely wrong in the interpretation given to section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act to the effect that the Nigerian Police was established for the federal government alone and as such the funding should solely be on the shoulders of the federal government.\n\nRivers State in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/511/2020 and instituted on its behalf by former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Daudu, had challenged the decision of the federal government to allocate funds directly from the federation account to fund some of its agencies, stating that the decision violates section 162 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe Rivers State government also stated that the actions of the federal government deprived it substantial revenue from the federation account and, therefore, prayed the court to nullify the allocation from the federation account.\n\nThe plaintiff also claimed that the levies imposed on companies operating in Nigeria by the federal government, be paid directly to the Nigeria Police Force Trust Fund, instead of the federation account was also illegal.\n\nThe judge agreed with the plaintiff that under the relevant laws, such levies were supposed to be paid directly to the federation account and not to any federal government agencies.\n\nThe judge held, \u201cI have carefully perused the issues raised by the plaintiff and I agree that no other person or entity is permitted to benefit direct fund allocation from the federation account.\n\n\u201cSection 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the defendant to make direct fund allocation from the Federation Account is untenable as it runs contrary to section 162 (3) of the 1999 Constitution, which expressly stated that the federal government, state governments and local governments shall derive direct fund allocation from the federation account.\u201d\n\nDefendant in the matter were the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF); Accountant General of the Federation; Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission and Minister of Finance.\n\nHowever only the Attorney General of the Federation filled processes to defend the federal government\u2019s action.\n\nThe AGF had in his preliminary objection asked the Federal High Court to decline jurisdiction in the matter on the ground that such suit ought to be filed directly at the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the preliminary objection was dismissed by Mohammed on the ground that it was misplaced and absurd.\n\nMeanwhile, Wike hailed the ruling, noting that the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act, which the federal government relied on deduct funds from the Federation Account was in contravention of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cI have always told people, it is not whether you must win or not, but it is a matter of when you see issues that you think are in contravention of our constitution and other laws, there is nothing wrong for you to challenge it, so that the right thing can be done.\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the money is given back to us, we can still on our own say police, we want to support you with this. But not the federal government arbitrarily deducting our money from the federation account and putting it to Police Trust Fund. I don\u2019t think that, that is right and I thank God that today the court has made a clear pronouncement on it.\u201d\n\nThe governor acknowledged that though the National Assembly was constitutionally empowered to enact laws, in enacting the Police Trust Fund Act, they went beyond their powers by contravening the provisions of the constitution.\n\nSpeaking further on the order of the court that the Rivers State government should be refunded the money deducted from its share to fund the police, Wike said the order would put an end to impunity.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cWe are happy that the court has said that they should refund us all the money deducted and, luckily, the principal parties, Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission, the Accountant General, Attorney General Office, they are all involved in the case.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Rivers State, but it is about the impunity, it is about the violation of the constitution, as if anybody can wake up one early morning and just decide to do one or two things, which is wrong. And I am happy that the decision we took, we are not wrong and I thank my legal team.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the sum at its weekly meeting in Abuja.\n\nThe N3 trillion now budgeted to sustain the payment of subsidy in 2022 alone, amounts to 17.5 per cent of the total of N17.126 trillion 2022 budget that was signed into law on the last day of 2021. Already, the approved 2022 budget has a deficit of N6.39 trillion, which is 37 per cent of the N17.126 trillion. This is a clear indication that the government may borrow more this year than it had earlier projected.\n\nThe N3 trillion approved by FEC is 55 per cent and 43 per cent of the capital component and recurrent expenditure of the 2022 budget, respectively.\n\nImplementation of the PIA, which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy, was initially meant to commence in February 2022, but it was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threat of protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the removal of subsidy was suspended on Monday.\n\nBut NLC, Lagos chapter, yesterday criticised the federal government\u2019s decision to recommend an 18-month extension of the PIA to the National Assembly.\n\nOn its part, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) urged the federal government to introduce palliatives to cushion the effect of subsidy withdrawal, irrespective of the postponement of the policy, as well as fix all the country\u2019s refineries.\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said only about eight states were presently benefitting directly from petrol subsidy. Fayemi said this at a joint meeting between the state governors, NLC, and TUC over the fuel subsidy withdrawal.\n\nFEC yesterday mandated the Finance, Budget and National Planning Ministry to reconcile the fuel subsidy budget with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, which prepared the estimate.\n\nThe council meeting presided by President Muhammadu Buhari also okayed the preparation of the 2022 Supplementary Budget, which would include the repeal of Clauses 10 and 11 of the Appropriation Act as well as incorporation of N103 billion removed by the lawmakers from the initial budget estimates, for submission to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe decisions reached at the virtual FEC meeting were made public by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who briefed newsmen after the meeting.\n\nAhmed said a memo in respect of the additional funding provisions to enable government meet the incremental fuel subsidy request in the 2022 budget was presented for the council\u2019s consideration.\n\nShe said only N443 billion had been provided for in the 2022 budget to accommodate subsidy from January to June, but taking the prevailing economic realities, both locally and globally, into consideration, FEC proposed a year-long provision for the subsidy.\n\nAhmed said the request was considered by the council, which directed the ministry to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cYou would recall that in the 2022 budget, as appropriated, we have made a provision of N443 billion for subsidy for January to June. Having taken into account the current realities: increased hardship in the population, heightened inflation, and also that the measures that needed to be taken to enable a smoother exit from the fuel subsidy are not yet in place, it was agreed by Council that it is desirable to exit fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC has presented to the ministry a request for N3 trillion as fuel subsidy for 2022. What this means is that we have to make an incremental provision of N2.557 trillion to be able to meet the subsidy requirement, which is averaging about N270 billion per month.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the actual under-recovery that has been charged to the federation was N1.2 trillion, which means an average of N100 billion, but in 2022, because of the increased crude oil price per barrel in the global market, now at $80 per barrel, and also because an NNPC\u2019s assessment is that the country is consuming 65.7 million litres per day, now we\u2019ll end up with incremental cost of N3 trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this has been considered by Council and we\u2019ve also been asked to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget, to also further discuss with NNPC on how to make provisions for this and how to rationalise this expenditure.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that her ministry had been directed to engage the NNPC with the possibility of bringing down the subsidy estimate.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe\u2019re going to engage NNPC to further interrogate the request that they presented with a view of trying to see how we can scale it down so that the country is not incurring N3 trillion for a fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe agreed with the view of governors, that there is a need to scale down on the size. So even as government is not immediately removing the fuel subsidy, we have to make sure that what the nation is incurring is efficient, and that it is real cost that has been consumed by the country.\u201d\n\nAhmed stated that the government would fund the N3 trillion subsidy regime through outstanding debts owed it by NNPC, which were being sorted out through on-going financial reconciliations with the company.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe have several reconciliations with NNPC, which is owing, in some cases, the government. So we want to be able to settle some of the subsidy costs through this reconciliation process.\n\n\u201cWhen we are done with that, whatever is left that we are not able to apply to what NNPC is owing the federation will not be increasing the deficit. And that means increased domestic borrowing. But we haven\u2019t finished with the issue of reconciliation.\u201d\n\nAhmed further disclosed that FEC approved the 2022 Supplementary Budget to take care of areas that were overlooked by the National Assembly in approving the Appropriation Bill. She said FEC approved amendments to parts of the 2022 budget, which had initially been adjusted by the National Assembly during its legislative deliberations on the budget proposal submitted to it by the president in 2021.\n\nAccording to her, the approved amendment to be transmitted to the National Assembly will request to repeal clauses 10 and 11 concerning the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) operations in the 2022 budget and restore the N103 billion the lawmakers had removed.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe second memo we presented to Council today has to do with a request for approval of the 2022 Appropriation Amendment. If you recall, when the president signed the 2022 appropriation into law on the 31st of December, he raised some concerns that he had in some of the provisions in the budget and had indicated that he will be submitting an amendment proposal to the National Assembly for them to effect improvements in what has been done to the budget.\n\n\u201cSo, today Council took that amendment proposal and I just want to report that part of the requests that Council has approved today is for the National Assembly to repeal clauses 10 and 11. Clause 10 is referring to a provision that has been made that will enable the EFCC and NFIU be able to take 10 per cent of whatever collections that they recover.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for that to be repealed because this is in direct contrast to the Acts of these two agencies and also it is in contravention of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and the Finance Act 2021.\n\n\u201cClause 11, on the other hand, is a provision that has been made that says that the Nigeria embassies and missions are now authorised by this Appropriation Act to expend funds allocated to them under Capital Components without the need to seek approval of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This, again, Council agreed, is inconsistent with financial regulations and also inconsistent with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act. So, we are asking for this to be repealed.\n\n\u201cCouncil also approved that some of the changes that were made in the Appropriation Act, totalling N103 billion, should be restored and examples of these are N22 billion that was provided for sinking fund to mature bonds that will be ready for payment in 2022 in the Nigerian domestic market, and also N12 billion for counterpart funding that is required for the various rail projects, and N189 million to be adjusted also in the budgets of the Ministry of Transport, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, and the Head of Service.\n\n\u201cThese are projects that are provided in these ministries that are completely unrelated to their mandate, so implementation will be a problem. Also, N5 billion to be restored for non-regular allowances of the Nigerian Navy, N15 billion to be restored for the regular allowances of the police formations and police commands and several others that Council looked at in detail.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s a detailed schedule of this N103 billion that Mr. President will be formally conveying to the National Assembly to restore the adjustments that were made.\u201d\n\nAhmed also disclosed that FEC ratified an instrument on diplomatic relations between Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis has to do with the confirmation of ratification of Customs Mutual Administrative Assistance Agreement between South Africa and Nigeria and the purpose for us is for the customs law in the respective territories to be properly observed to prevent and also enhance investigation and to combat customs offenses and to afford each country mutual assistance in cases concerning the delivery of documents regarding the application of customs laws in two countries.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this for us is cooperation between Nigeria and South Africa, as it has become even more important now with the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement. It will also help to increase trade relations between the two countries and facilitate exchange of information as well as strengthen our bi-national cooperation.\u201d\n\nNLC Knocks FG for Proposing 18 Months Extension\n\nNLC said the federal government was only postponing the evil day. Chairperson of NLC, Lagos Chapter, Agnes Sessi, spoke yesterday on \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a programme on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers. Sessi said government had been very deceitful, as it had never fulfilled its promises to Nigerians regarding the maintenance of the refineries.\n\nShe stated that successive governments had deceived the populace into believing that they had to subsidise petrol.\n\nSessi said, \u201cWe need a concerted effort to fight the problem of corruption in our society, we thought it could be better during this administration, but it is getting worse. Everybody needs to speak and kill the slogan, which says if you cannot beat them, you join them.\n\n\u201cWe are not supposed to join them because successive governments have been unable to do the turnaround maintenance, despite the huge amount of money they have spent.\u201d\n\nDefending accusations that the NLC was engaged in smuggling of petrol, Sessi insisted it was simply blackmail because they chose not to be a part of the evil plans.\n\nShe advised that people should stop shifting the blame to labour, saying the unions are only a fraction of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because government has seen the kind of mobilisation and that we were serious, that is why they made a U-turn and reversed their decision that would have caused problems and pushed Nigerians to the highest level of economic downturn,\u201d Sessi concluded.\n\nOn his part, the Director General (DG) of Micheal Imodu Institute of Labour Studies, Issa Aremu, commended the leadership of NLC for remaining focused and for keeping to the tradition of the movement of engaging policies.\n\nAccording to Aremu, \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this process so I know what it takes to mobilise and demobilise. I am happy that inclusive issues of development are up for discussions.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cI am happy that we are all on the same page and it can be business as usual within the petroleum downstream sector.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long drawn issue and I think additional 18 months cannot be too long for us to look at all the issues as we are looking at nation building and not the regime. We shouldn\u2019t be a debating but functional society.\u201d\n\nHe called on the relevant stakeholders to stop hoarding petroleum products while the transition process is being managed.\n\nThe director general insisted that labour should be a little more balanced, saying the government had retained jobs and paid salaries as and when due.\n\nIPMAN Wants Dilapidated Refineries Fixed\n\nNational Operations Controller, IPMAN, Mike Osatuyi, reiterated their support for the federal government in whatever decisions they made. Osatuyi noted that the 18 months suspension would give the government the avenue to put in palliatives and support for Nigerians.\n\nOsatuyi also clarified the notion about the group being government agents, stating that they are an association of businessmen who condemn subsidy.\n\nIPMAN, in a statement, appealed to the federal government to give priority to the revitalisation of the four refineries in the country ahead of the removal of the subsidy on petroleum products.\n\nPresident of IPMAN, Alhaji Debo Ahmed, in the statement, also appealed to the federal government to ensure the availability of petroleum products to the NNPC depots across the country. He stated that selective supply to private depots was, \u201cmaking it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN president restated his association\u2019s demand for payment of outstanding Bridging Claims owed marketers by the defunct Petroleum Equalisation Fund, now operating under the name, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe leadership of IPMAN commends the federal government for the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy. We reiterate our position that the four nations\u2019 refineries be repaired and allowed to function optimally before the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe also use this opportunity to call on the federal government to resume the supply of petroleum products to NNPC depots nationwide as against the selective supply to private depots, making it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\n\n\u201cOur huge funds are tied up with PPMC Ltd, a subsidiary of NNPC, where members pay for NNPC products supplied to their depots. We are equally pleading that marketers transportation claims be paid to allow members remain afloat in business.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fayemi told the governors\u2019 meeting with NLC and TUC that only about eight states benefitted from the federal government\u2019s fuel subsidy.\n\nParticipants at the meeting called on the federal government to constitute a forensic examination on the activities of the NNPC. They alleged that the national oil company was bandying falsehood in terms of the amount being spent on petrol subsidy.\n\nThe meeting, which was held at the NGF secretariat, Abuja, brokered a partnership between the NGF and labour.\n\nDelivering his opening remarks at the meeting, Fayemi argued that the country\u2019s economy was at a precipice and, \u201cit has become necessary for the two groups to carefully verify all of NNPC\u2019s estimates to ensure that whatever action is taken on subsidy, it would be the people that get direct benefits and not a few wealthy individuals and their cronies in the country.\u201d\n\nFayemi told the labour leaders that subsidy removal had remained an on-gong conversation, not just among governors, but also the country at large.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor stated that, \u201cThere are raging questions of accountability associated with subsidy removal in the country and observed that the NGF and the NLC can jointly work together to proffer solutions that heal the economy and provide succour to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe NGF chairman had led to the meeting the delegation of governors, which included Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State, who is also chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State. He stressed that all the countries surrounding Nigeria, including Niger, Mali, Cameroun and Ghana, had their fuel pump price in dollar equivalent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says no ceremony to be held for swearing-in\n\nDavid-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nAnambra State governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo has said that in order to promote domestic brands, his official vehicles when he assumes office would be those manufactured by the Innoson Vehicle Motors (IVM).\n\nSoludo who visited members of the inauguration committee stated this in his speech to the committee members.\n\nThe governor-elect also said it was not a coincidence that he had been wearing local fabrics known as Akwete, saying it was part of his intentional to support local brands and to make a statement with it.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy akwete dress is not just dress, it\u2019s a statement. I want to make a statement with it. You know, in the entire south-east, this is the only textile thing alive, and it\u2019s handmade, by the women of akwaete in Abia State.\n\n\u201cIgbo land is one and we must protect it. We want to bring back the zeal of patronising our own. I have said it even during campaigns, and I meant it, that if I win, the official car of the governor of Anambra State will be Innoson Vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe dresses I will wear are those made here (south-east). We must protect the things that are made in our place. Something is about to happen in Igboland, and together we will get there.\u201d\n\nOn his upcoming swearing-in, Soludo said there would be no ceremony to mark the event, stressing that no amount would be spent on it.\n\nHe said the day was simply to mark his first day at work, saying even though it is a weekend, he would spend eight hours of the day working.\n\n\u201cI have made a wish that not even one kobo of Anambra people\u2019s money will be spent on that swearing-in ceremony. It is a wish, and I mean it. What are we spending money on? Just few people coming to the inauguration and witnessing it, then I will open office and get down to work immediately.\n\n\u201cI do not wish any event, dancers or players and all that. I just want to show up for work, like every first work day. Though it is going to be a Friday, which is weekend, but I\u2019m going to work for over eight hours that day.\n\n\u201cNo ceremony, no event, no party, nothing. Not even 10 kobo will be spent. So the people who are saying N20 million has been budgeted should go and tell us where they will get that money. It is going to be work, work, work, and that is what we epitomise.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Okay direct, indirect, consensus primaries for parties\n\n\u2022Stipulate conditions for consensus \u2022Proposed legislation to be transmitted to Buhari in seven days\n\nUdora Orizu and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nThe Senate yesterday passed the harmonised Clause 84 of the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022, which allows political parties to adopt three modes of primaries.\n\nThe proposed legislation, earlier passed last year, was not assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari had cited the provisions of Clause 84, which made direct primary compulsory for all political parties in electing candidates for elections, as his reason for refusing assent to the bill. The two chambers of the National Assembly then recommitted the bill for fresh legislation and added other options, as advised by the president.\n\nThe harmonised version accommodated the direct, indirect, and consensus modes of primary election.\n\nThe Senate had earlier passed the three modes of primaries, but the version of the House of Representatives did not include the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe upper chamber considered the harmonised version of the bill at plenary and passed it.\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the bill had given sufficient and clear definition to the modes of primary election now adopted by both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nThe re-amendment was sequel to a motion on \u201crescission on clause 84 of the Electoral Act No. 26 2010 (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and Committal to the Committee of the Whole.\u201d The motion was sponsored by Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nThe amended bill provides in clause 84 (2), \u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct, indirect primaries or consensus.\u201d\n\nIt adds in 84(3), \u201cA political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election in its constitution, guidelines, or rules for nomination of candidates for elections, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nOn direct primaries in 84 (4), the amended version provides, \u201cA political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of presidential primaries, all registered members of the party shall vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the federation.\n\n\u201c(b) The procedure in paragraph (a) above of this subsection shall be adopted for direct primaries in respect of gubernatorial, senatorial, federal and state constituencies.\n\n\u201c(c) Special Conventions or Congresses shall be held to ratify the candidate with the highest number of votes at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nIn terms of indirect primaries, the bill provides under 84(5), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below: (a) In the case of nominations to the position of presidential candidate, the political party shall \u2013 (i) hold a Special Presidential Convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party where delegates shall vote for aspirants of their choice.\n\n\u201c(ii) the aspirant with the highest number of votes cast at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the presidential primaries of the political party and that aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nIt further provides under 84(7), \u201cWhere there is only one aspirant or a consensus candidate in a political party for any of the elective positions mentioned in subsection (5)(a), (b), (c) and (d), the party shall convene a special convention or congress at a designated centre on a specified date for the confirmation of such aspirant and the name of the aspirant shall be forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral Bill provides in 84(8), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rule the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress meeting.\u201d\n\nOn consensus candidate, the bill in 84(9)(a) provides, \u201cA political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nIt states further in paragraph (b), \u201cWhere a political party is unable to secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert to the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective positions.\u201d\n\nThe bill states in paragraph (c), \u201cA Special Convention or nomination congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, explained during plenary that the leadership of the House met on Monday and decided that to facilitate speedy passage of the bill and deepen democracy, both chambers of the National Assembly decided to add the consensus provision. Gbajabiamila, however, said the inclusion came with certain provisos so as to protect all aspirants for all positions, and give all an even playing field.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that this House last week, as soon as we returned, looked into the complaints and added the provision of indirect primaries to our law. Unfortunately, the Senate added both indirect and consensus, which necessitated the possible need for a conference committee of both chambers.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the House met yesterday and decided that in the interest of speedy passage and also to deepen our democracy, the House and Senate decided to add the consensus provision, so there will be no need for conference but with certain provisos.\u201d\n\nBriefing journalists shortly after plenary, the House spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, said the bill would be transmitted to Buhari within seven days and hopefully he would look at it as quickly as possible.\n\nThe speaker said though the lawmakers included the consensus option, it did not mean political godfathers would seat in a room, prepare a list and call it consensus. He added that anyone who went against the provisions, as stipulated in the bill, could be taken to court.\n\nKalu said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the way it used to be before, that political godfathers will sit in a room and then prepare a list and call it consensus. That\u2019s not in the script of this particular section.\n\n\u201cSo, if you prepare a list and you\u2019re not able to give an evidence of a written withdrawal by those who are aspiring, who have now agreed for one candidate to go, you have gone against the spirit of this particular provision.

          "title": "He built TikTok's strategy in Africa, now he's building Kippa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nTikTok made huge waves when it announced its sponsorship of the African Cup of Nations, the continent\u2019s biggest football tournament. Kennedy Ekezie-Joseph who helped lead TikTok\u2019s entry into Africa, was no longer with the company for that moment of triumph. Instead, he was grinding away at a new startup. Big mistake? Maybe not.\n\nLeaving a budding career at social networking behemoth that has big ambitions on your home continent, to launch a startup, sounds like a suicidal move. But for Ekezie-Joseph, 23, who was part of a small group that led TikTok\u2019s foray into Africa and was well-positioned to benefit from the company\u2019s continental ambitions, it actually wasn\u2019t. That much became clear when his startup attracted record seed funding.\n\nEkezie-Joseph\u2019s startup, Kippa, is a bookkeeping and finance app that he founded with Duke Ekezie (his brother) and Jephthah Uche in February 2021. It has had a meteoric trajectory since its launch in June.\n\nIn November, the startup hauled in $3.2 million in pre-seed funding, arguably one of the largest early-stage fund-raises in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile phone and Whatsapp-friendly, Kippa targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SME\u2019s) providing them with free, easy-to-use accounting software. Kippa then looks at potential financing opportunities and makes revenue by taking commission fees and earning interest by lending companies working capital.\n\nTo date, more than a billion dollars in transactions have been recorded by the platform, according to the founders.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria today, there are 47 million SMEs, according to SMED Analyst statistics out there. About 280,000 merchants out of that number, have used the product. And our goal is over the next five to 10 years to capture as much of that number as possible, by building out new features, by launching new product lines,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said in an interview with bird.\n\nAs a child, Ekezie-Joseph saw first-hand how the absence of judicious record-keeping could impact fragile and shock-prone micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n\u201cMy dad had a small business around when I was born, which he lost. And so for me, it really means a lot to build for a segment that I feel very intimately familiar with,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nF-R: Duke, Japhthah, and Kennedy, co-founders of Kippa\n\nKippa (a play on book\u201dkeeper\u201d) is a bookkeeping mobile app that allows small business owners to keep track of their daily income and expense transactions, issue invoices, provide receipts to their customers and create marketing materials like business cards.\n\nThe app also keeps track of debtors who owe the subscriber companies money.\n\nWhen he launched Kippa, Ekezie-Joseph knew from personal experience that he was addressing an existential threat to businesses. This gave him and his team confidence.\n\nTrue to their projection, Kippa was an instant hit at launch, striking a chord with thousands of SMEs in Nigeria, underlining the opportunities and the demand for this particular service.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, SMEs have been laggers when it comes to the adoption of digital technology. What we\u2019ve seen is digital technology has changed very many other industries \u2013 healthcare, transport \u2013 but the way businesses are run and the overall back-office operations are still very manual, they\u2019ve really not changed since the 60s,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re trying to do here is unite the tailwind of the deep penetration of the internet that is continuing to grow across the continent and the smartphone penetration. So by 2025, Nigeria alone will contribute 4 per cent of total new smartphone users in the world. And we think that\u2019s such an exciting deal in that, companies like us are building on the back of to provide tools that business owners can use on these devices that they have.\u201d\n\nKennedy Ekezie-Joseph presented with a Queen\u2019s Young Leaders Award in 2018 for his work in promoting women\u2019s rights in the areas of female genital mutilation (FGM), domestic abuse and forced child marriage and access to education for girls.\n\nEkezie-Joseph and his team are now planning another round of fundraising to scale the company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cSo we will be talking to investors over the next couple of months. And one of the big things we believe in is building relationships early and taking time to identify the right partners to work with. So if we do meet investors who are the right fit, we\u2019ll be able to work with them,\u201d he said.\n\nEkezie-Joseph was an early recipient of the prestigious Yenching Scholarship, a masters program at the elite Peking University in Beijing, China.\n\nA top Nigerian debater while still at college, as a 16-year-old college freshman, he had already begun using his voice to change his community, founding a social enterprise that worked to end the practice of female genital mutilation in communities and increase access to education for young girls.\n\nWith two TEDx talks under his belt, a Barack Obama Young African Leaders Fellowship and a Resolution Fellowship and numerous recognitions and accolades, Ekezie-Joseph has a track record of success despite his young age.\n\nA master\u2019s degree from an elite academy at Beijing\u2019s top research university must have made Ekezie-Joseph a shoo-in at TikTok, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance. He was part of the early expansion of TikTok into Africa. But the experience at a university that has given rise to some of the world\u2019s greatest tech companies and spawned dozens of top global entrepreneurs, may have also given him bigger ambitions.\n\n\u201cI was the first line here and had the team to lead our acquisition and growth for the company\u2019s expansions. Africa? We had a couple thousand users of the product, then. And you know, we\u2019ve gone from then, 2018, to today being the third-most-used social app in Africa, with tens of millions of users,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging the economic impact of COVID-19 on the continent, Ekezie-Joseph noted that it had helped fuel the growth of the tech industry and internet adoption in Africa.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time many merchants understood that they could do business online. That was the first time many consumers understood that they could transact with merchants online. So it almost helped us leapfrog the absence of trust around digital tools. And that\u2019s been super helpful. And more and more people are doing business online now. So that is very significant for our growth as a business,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the early conversion of bookkeepers and small business owners, Ekezie-Joseph is the first to admit that there are plenty of hurdles ahead.\n\n\u201cTo bring the right people in the door, bring the most experienced people in the industry and have them around the table working with us pursuing the mission. And so that means bringing regulators on board, you know, people will have experience engaging with them, and industry veterans. So that is a very big one for us,\u201d he said in an interview with the bird story agency.\n\n\u02dc\u201dThe second thing is also executing on our roadmap\u2026the way we think about it last year, we built a really solid product and validated the need for it in the market. And this is truly the year we build processes around that and leverage that and we continue to build at breakneck speed for all users and establish our place in the market.\u201d\n\nSo have there been misgivings over leaving TikTok?\n\n\u201cNo! The plan was always to eventually move back to Nigeria and build a startup and the onset of the pandemic in China, gave me the perfect reason to make the move back and take the leap,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "American tech conglomerate Meta (formerly Facebook) on Monday joined the list of tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia who have built an AI supercomputer, with the recent announcement of its new Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research SuperCluster (RSC). Meta claims RSC is already among the fastest supercomputers and, when completed in mid-2022, will be the world\u2019s fastest.\n\nSupercomputers are high-performance computers that perform computationally intensive (high-speed) tasks such as weather forecasting, climate research, and oil and gas exploration. AI supercomputers are an improved version of supercomputers that can carry out more calculations per second than regular supercomputers, using the same hardware.\n\n\u201cRSC will help Meta\u2019s AI researchers build better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyse text, images and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and more,\u201d the company explained in a blog post.\n\nWith more than 2.6 billion monthly active users, Meta\u2019s Facebook is the most popular social media in the world. In Africa, Meta\u2019s suite of social messaging tools\u2014Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp\u2014serve as the internet for hundreds of millions of people. Businesses and consumers depend heavily on these messaging platforms because its use is ubiquitous and access to these apps and sites are free or discounted on many African telecom networks.\n\nRSC is expected to aid Meta in identifying harmful content on Facebook and Instagram; processing larger and longer videos with higher sampling rates; and in developing new augmented reality tools. It\u2019s a valuable tool that\u2019ll aid Meta in accomplishing its plans to move billions of users into the Metaverse in the near future.\n\nBefore this announcement, Meta has been using the first generation of the supercomputer designed in 2017, which could design 22,000 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a single cluster that performs 35,000 training jobs a day.\n\nRealising the need to accelerate progress, work on the RSC began in early 2020, with Meta engineers designing and building a new AI supercomputer system from ground up.\n\n\u201cRSC today comprises a total of 760 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems as its compute nodes, for a total of 6,080 GPUs\u2014with each A100 GPU being more powerful than the V100 used in the previous system,\u201d the company said.\n\nCompared to the first generation of Meta\u2019s supercomputer, early benchmarks on RSC show that it \u201cruns computer vision workflows up to 20 times faster, runs the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) more than nine times faster, and trains large-scale NLP models three times faster. That means a model with tens of billions of parameters can finish training in three weeks, compared with nine weeks before,\u201d Meta said.\n\n\n\nAware of privacy concerns, the company added that RSC has been designed from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. Meta\u2019s researchers can safely train models using encrypted user-generated data that is not decrypted until right before training.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater. Earth. Fire. Air.\n\nIf you are an Avatar: The Last Airbender head like me, you are probably expecting to see the following tagline, \u201cLong ago, the four nations\u2026\u201d\n\nAll in due time, my friend. But please, follow closely.\n\nOn Monday, August 29, 2005, the historic storm, Hurricane Katrina, hit cities lined up on the Louisiana-Mississippi border in New Orleans. For many, that was the last time they saw their homes and over 1,000 lives were lost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Boxing Day in 2004, the world\u2019s third-largest earthquake occurred, resulting in one of the worst natural disasters \u2014 The Asian Tsunami. An estimated 227,898 people died in 14 countries on the coastline, including India, Indonesia, and Thailand.\n\nSo, why the Avatar reference and what does it mean here? The original idea was to list different natural disasters, but I felt that all four elements play a vital role in these situations. Water: tsunamis and earthquakes; Earth: the world; Air: tornadoes and earthquakes; and Fire: the aftermath.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nA common ground connecting both disasters is the major focus of this article. But before that, why mention the disasters in the first place? What is the connection?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both situations, the NigeriaSat-1, built by the UK\u2019s Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) in 2003, was the first satellite to send images of the US east coast after Hurricane Katrina. It also provided valuable images for aid workers following the Asian Tsunami.\n\nBefore being decommissioned in 2014 as part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation, NigeriaSat-1 was used to respond to floods in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and West Africa. It has also been used for various mapping campaigns like the Amazon and Vietnam\u2019s coastal areas.\n\nNigeria does have other satellites, and they\u2019ve been used in different situations, but before that, let\u2019s do some backtracking.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nA history of Nigeria\u2019s space programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\u2019s space station in Kano \u2014 one of 18 Project Mercury space stations strategically placed along the Earth\u2019s orbital track. The stations were part of a vast global communication network necessary to track spacecraft and relay information back to Mercury Control Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA. Source: Globalvoices\n\nNigeria\u2019s space history is a long and chequered one. Few people know \u2014 or remember \u2014 that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) built the first satellite earth station in Nigeria, the NASA Tracking Station 5, in 1961 in Kano to monitor the Gemini and Apollo space missions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the station was closed in 1963 before both missions were concluded in 1966 and 1972, respectively.\n\nIn 1976, at an ECOWAS meeting held in Addis Ababa, Nigeria first declared its space ambition, and it took 23 years to set up a space agency. In May 1999, the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) was born following the recommendation of a nine-person committee of experts constituted by the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI).\n\nSide note: NASENI was established in 1992 by the Nigerian federal government on the recommendations of the White Paper Committee on the 1991 Report of a 150-member National Committee on Engineering Infrastructure comprising scientists, engineers, administrators, federal and state civil servants, economists, lawyers, bankers, and industrialists.\n\nNASRDA\u2019s mandate is to \u201cvigorously pursue the attainment of space capabilities as an essential tool for the socio-economic development and the enhancement of the quality of life of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe agency is under the purview of the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria\u2019s space programme is managed by NASRDA. And in 2000, the National Space Policy (NSP) was approved, and a 25-year roadmap for its implementation was endorsed in 2005. But we\u2019ll get to those in a bit.\n\nIn 2006, the state-owned Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited was formed to manage and operate Nigeria\u2019s communication satellites under the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy.\n\nIn its 15 years of existence, the company, a limited liability enterprise that is yet to turn a profit, does not have an establishing Act and has been the subject of controversy after recently claiming it would acquire two new satellites in 2023 and 2025.\n\nIt also has a subsidiary, GeoApps Plus Limited, which is expected to handle the sale of satellite images acquired by Nigeria\u2019s earth observation satellites. According to its Facebook page, it provides training in Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing for Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), and the military, among others.\n\nIn 2017, after the Defence Space Administration Act was passed into law, and following the suggestions of the NSP, the Defence Space Administration (DSA) was officially commissioned to acquire more space science technologies to aid the military.\n\nFormerly known as the Defence Space Agency, the DSA was first established on October 9, 2014, and is currently training several engineers in partnership with NIGCOMSAT and NASRDA.\n\nBut there\u2019s still a lot to unpack from the NSP and we\u2019ll be taking a look soon.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nWhat Nigeria\u2019s National Space Policy looks like\n\nAs we found out in 2018, as with most countries, Nigeria\u2019s space programme is shrouded in secrecy.\n\nBy some stroke of luck and a dedicated LinkedIn search, I found the profile of Dr Halilu Ahmad Shaba, NASRDA DG, who agreed to talk to me for this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Halilu Ahmad, Director-General. NASRDA\n\nI asked him what kind of policies we might expect under his tenure, and while he didn\u2019t tell me, he said one thing for certain, the NSP will be reviewed. A task that would be done alongside the overhaul of the current roadmap, which President Muhammadu Buhari has sanctioned.\n\nBut while we await the review, we can visit the current policy.\n\nThe NSP is a ten-chapter document outlining several objectives like defence and law enforcement, disaster prediction, earth observation, poverty alleviation, promotion of international cooperation, and the establishment of research centres.\n\nIt also provides Nigeria\u2019s space economic model, a public-private partnership that involves short, medium, and long-term plans.\n\nShort-term, the government is responsible for all investments in space technology development.\n\nMedium-term, the government implements the partial commercialisation of NASRDA\u2019s products and services developed during the short-term economic development plan.\n\nLong-term, the government partners with the private sector to implement the public-private partnership framework for the space programme.\n\nTo achieve this, the roadmap contains benchmarks:\n\nLaunch of NigeriaSat-1 by 2002\n\nTraining of Nigerian engineers to build earth observation (EO) satellites abroad by 2006\n\nLaunch of two new satellites by 2011\n\nTraining of Nigerian astronauts by 2015\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar by 2015\n\nDevelopment and Building of Made in Nigeria Satellites by 2018\n\nDevelopment of Rocketry/Propulsion Systems by 2025\n\nDevelopment of Spin-Off of Allied Industries \u2013 Electronics, Software etc. by 2028\n\nLarge-Scale Commercialisation of Space Technology & Know-how by 2030\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nDown the rabbit hole of implementation\n\nAs far as implementation goes, Nigeria has had some success. We already talked about NigeriaSat-1. NASRDA has also facilitated the training of engineers in building EO satellites, with the NigeriaSat-X solely built by Nigerians, alongside the Nigeria-Sat-2 launched by the SSTL in 2011.\n\nThe NigeriaSat-1 and NigeriaSat-X have a lifespan of seven years and should have deorbited in 2018. But, four years later, both are still functioning by \u201cgrace\u201d, as said by Shaba, and as an expert I spoke to told me, Nigeria is getting more value for money.\n\nIn 2017, the EduSat-1, a collaboration between the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA), Ondo State, Nigeria, and NASRDA, was built by Nigerians and launched from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, but was decommissioned in 2019.\n\nAs to astronauts, you\u2019d probably remember the current Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, telling Nigerians in March 2016 that Nigeria would have an astronaut in space on or before 2030. Before then, a fraudulent email about a Nigerian astronaut stranded in space had circulated, eliciting varying reactions. However, Shaba confirms that this milestone has not been achieved.\n\nNigeria\u2019s dream to launch in space by 2030 does not look any closer to reality. As of 2021, 44 satellites have been launched by 14 African countries, but none have been done from an African launch site.\n\nAs of 2019, the Centre for Space Transport and Propulsion (CSTP), Epe, Lagos State, has completed three successful experimental rocket launches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentre for Space Transport and Propulsion (CSTP), Epe, Lagos State, completed three successful experimental rocket launches in 2019. Source: Space in Africa\n\nBut, due to the hushed nature of Nigeria\u2019s space programme, we only know a previous milestone altitude of 10km before 2019. Although Shaba says it has increased since then.\n\n\u201cBecause it can also be used for utility purposes, we made a case that we are not going to announce that. So we closed it to the public and only made some skeletal speeches about that.\u201d\n\nCommunication satellites\n\nOne vital aspect of space technology is communication satellites. Although they may not provide as fast Internet speeds as subsea cables or be as reliable, in a country like Nigeria where broadband penetration is as low as 41%, any little thing helps.\n\nCurrently, however, satellites only contribute 0.2% to Nigeria\u2019s Internet connectivity.\n\nAfter the NigeriaSat-1\u2019s successful launch, in 2004, the government contracted state-owned China Great Wall Industry Corporation Limited (CGWIC) to build the NigComSat-1, a communication satellite.\n\nThe NigComSat-1 was launched in 2007, but due to an anomaly in its solar array, which meant it did not have enough power, it was shut down in 2008. Thankfully, the Nigerian government had a failsafe insurance policy that enabled them to contract CGWIC again to build the NigComSat-1R.\n\nThe NigComat-1R was launched in 2011 and has a 15-year life span, and, just like its predecessor, was managed by NIGCOMSAT. It had the exact specifications as the NigComSat-1, seeing that it was a replacement.\n\nIn 2018, Reuters reported that Nigeria had agreed to a $550 million deal with the CGWIC once again for two communication satellites which were to be ready by 2020 and 2021. But there\u2019s no accurate information as to whether the deal pushed through or not. Especially after the world\u2019s focus moved to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShaba, however, calls this move and the current one by NIGCOMSAT to contract new satellites as counterproductive to what has already been done by NASRDA in training engineers and building satellites.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have two satellite manufacturing agencies. And NIGCOMSAT is [a] communications limited, and we said it should restrict itself to transpondence.\u201d\n\nSide note: Transpondence is the receiving, sending, or reciprocal actions of receiving and sending messages or information through transponders or one of various radio transmission devices.\n\nCommercialisation of space tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Temidayo Onisosun, Founder, Space in Africa, an Africa-focused media, analytics, and consulting firm focusing on the space and satellite industry, explained, the space ecosystem is divided into upstream and downstream.\n\nLike upstream companies in the oil and gas sector, space startups specialise in exploration and drilling. In the space ecosystem, this could mean rocket or satellite launching or space missions.\n\nA company downstream would be more focused on remote sensing, communication, among others. Currently, Nigeria\u2019s space ecosystem is mostly government run, especially in upstream activities.\n\nTo aid its 2030 goal of large scale commercialisation, in 2010, the NASRDA Act was passed, establishing the National Space Council (NSC) as regulator. The Act says the NSC can approve licences for space activities in Nigeria. It, however, makes no provision for private partnership, thus limiting private companies to a participatory role.\n\nAccording to Shaba, as part of Nigeria\u2019s medium-term goals, NASRDA\u2019s products are to be commercialised.\n\n\u201cWe try to call them and let them know. For example, if data is supposed to cost 30 million, we sell it at 25 million. You sell it and make your money. And then you return the remaining money to the agency.\u201d\n\nThis data is information gotten from Nigeria\u2019s available satellites.\n\nShaba also mentioned spin-offs from its Quick Win projects, which focused on specific issues like food security, human security, disaster management, climate change, data management, and educational packages in space science.\n\nThis included research done on the effect of high-frequency radiation on Wistar rats. A study which was to help the Agency determine the former on humans. Although it is not clear what this new research brings to the table as it appears to be a well-researched field. But, of course, science is always a curiosity.\n\nIn 2020, there were 23 Quick Win projects.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nNotable achievements by NASRDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most Nigerians, in a country heavily hit by recession and facing continued insecurity, a space programme looks like vanity metrics, showboating, if you will. But space technology is quite important.\n\nAccording to Statista, in 2020, the global space economy made approximately $446.9 billion, increasing from $428 billion in the previous year, with commercial space products and services accounting for almost 50% of the total turnover.\n\nBut beyond the economic impact, there are spillovers into other sectors, like agriculture, medicine, transport, the environment, and communications.\n\nOver the last few years, NASRDA has worked with Nigerian and foreign military agencies to eliminate insurgency in West Africa.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the Agency used the NigeriaSat-X to produce a 10-metre digital elevation simulation map and vegetation density map of Sambisa Forest to help the military in the insurgency fight.\n\nBasically, using data obtained from the satellite, NASRDA created a digital representation of the forest.\n\nIn 2012, NASRDA aided the Malian government during the civil war between Southern and Northern factions.\n\nThe media house also says, \u201cthe space agency donated over 4000 satellite images estimated to be worth \u20a63 billion ($8.3 million) to Nigerian universities and research institutions, using NigeriaSat-1 alone. In all, NigeriaSat-1 directly contributed over \u20a610.5 billion ($29 million) to Nigeria\u2019s economy within its first nine years in orbit.\u201d\n\nThese activities were also continued using the newer satellites, the NigeriaSat-2 and NigeriaSat-X.\n\nIn 2015, NIGCOMSAT won the contract to manage Belarus\u2019 satellite, the BelinterSat-1, a revenue source which was estimated would bring in $400,000 annually.\n\nCombining these with the Quick Win projects and several other spin-offs, it would appear the Agency has not completely failed.\n\nHowever, although Shaba describes the Nigerian space ecosystem as \u201cvibrant\u201d, the country still lags behind, a problem he attributes to funding.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nGoing back to the basics\n\nWhile I talked to Henry Ibitolu, a former Research Intern at NASRDA, he drew an interesting comparison with India.\n\n\u201cIndia right now has almost joined the league of countries launching rockets. When the US government, through NASA, sent rockets to Mars, they spent $2 billion. But when India leveraged its local manpower and technology to land a rover on Mars, they spent $20 million. That\u2019s about 10% or less of what the US spent.\u201d\n\nI would later check the figures, and although not accurate, the numbers do say a lot. India spent $73 million and was successful on its first try.\n\nTo be fair, India\u2019s space mission was done in 2013 while the US first successful Mars landing happened in 1975; several things made it much cheaper, even by previous standards.\n\nIndia was careful to work with only local companies and engineers and made several adjustments to the technology to make it more efficient. A position made possible by an educational system that prioritises Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses.\n\nOnly two Nigerian Universities \u2014 Kwara State University, Malete, Kwara State, and recently the Lagos State University, Lagos, offer courses in aerospace and Aeronautical engineering.\n\nI also found only one university \u2014 FUTA \u2014 that teaches remote Sensing and GIS as a course separate from geomatics and surveying. Several universities also offer Masters in Remote Sensing.\n\nIbitolu said the government should invest in STEM education.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government should partner with universities to come up with innovative ideas. We have local technology that we can leverage on to make use of that.\u201d\n\nAn opinion Oniosun shares.\n\nInterestingly, all seven NASRDA research centres are situated in universities.\n\nBut beyond, education is funding. The space industry is capital intensive. I mean, we just talked about India spending $74 million for its Mars landing.\n\nIn 2021, NASRDA and its parastatals received \u20a622.8 billion ($55.6 million) \u2014 14.4% \u2014 from the total budget allocation for the Ministry of Science and Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total budgetary allocation for Nigeria\u2019s space programme was \u20a635.7 billion ($86.8 million), with NASRDA accounting for 64%, NIGCOMSAT, 22%, and DSA, 14%.\n\nTo put all of this into perspective, given the world\u2019s current fascination with Mars and using NASA\u2019s current Mars mission named Perseverance, which is expected to cost $2.7 billion, Nigeria\u2019s entire space budget is barely 2% of the total cost.\n\nA more obvious choice might be a satellite, which costs anything from $400,000 to $1 million to build.\n\nIt still leaves us with one conclusion, Nigeria\u2019s space programme is grossly underfunded.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut solution, Nigeria\u2019s best bet lies in its space economic model, the long-term plan to be precise. A public-private partnership where the government works with privately-owned companies.\n\nBut Ibitolu advises NASRDA to achieve its dream of sending an astronaut into space before taking on a more regulatory role.\n\n\u201cBefore you move to being a regulatory agency, you must have led by example. Before you tell people to do something, you must have done it yourself. But if you\u2019ve not done anything and you are telling people to do it, it\u2019s not possible. Because you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA position reminiscent of current startup woes in Nigeria.\n\nUsing the NASA-Space-X analogy, Oniosun believes NASRDA should work with universities and private companies empowering local startups.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the US government, NASA had to trust SpaceX, to innovate and do awesome stuff. Maybe Nigeria has to do that.\n\n\u201cThe Space agency has trained hundreds of persons to Masters and PHD level, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It has not done anything before, and maybe they should stop wasting their money.\n\n\u201cInstead of the Agency trying to do all of that by itself, it should trust these companies and begin to outsource its technology.\u201d\n\nBut what does the private sector look like in Nigeria?\n\nThriving or declining?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\nAccording to Ibitolu, the downstream sector is thriving with several remote sensing and GIS companies in the space. But currently, there\u2019s no private company in the upstream space.\n\nA problem that could also perhaps be attributed to the capital intensive nature of the industry, as funding remains a challenge. And Olayinka Fagbemiro, Assistant Chief Scientific Officer at NASRDA, believes banks could be the solution, most especially the African Development Bank (AfDB), but there has to be trust.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the private sector, this is an aspect that the government has to work on. Why? There has to be an enabling environment. There has to be a certain ease of doing business in that aspect that would make individuals able to commit the huge, enormous resources that need to go into the private sector and be a player in the space programme.\n\n\u201cIf banks, for example, can provide some sort of loans for startups in the space sector, there are a lot of smart, young Nigerians coming up daily with expertise, but the major challenge is capital. And Africa is losing out a whole lot as a result because Africa has a lot to gain from space products.\u201d\n\nBut it would have to be a long term investment or credit plan. However, Shaba decries Nigerian investors\u2019 eye for quick profit.\n\nBack to Table of Contents \u2191\n\nA new age?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nIn May 2021, Shaba was appointed as the new Director-General of NASRDA, and I asked him what to expect from NASRDA under his reign. Shaba\u2019s answers: lots of restructuring, more satellites, and functioning in line with the government.\n\nIbitolu expects some changes.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that we will see change with the new administration. When I did my IT with NASRDA, under the previous administration, I saw people being employed who had studied Yoruba. But we are hopeful we will see new developments at NASRDA.\u201d\n\nA position Fagbemiro agrees with.\n\nBefore writing this, I hoped to determine whether the Space Agency has failed in its duties. My conclusion is that, to a large extent, compared to other space programmes, while it cannot be regarded as a total failure, it cannot be regarded as an out and out success either.\n\nBut, it could be better.

Probably never if you are being honest.\n\nIn May 2022, Nigeria\u2019s space agency, the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), will be 23 years old. If NASRDA was a person, it would probably be done with university and serving the nation or wracking their brain over an uncompleted final year project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, in the 23 years since NASRDA was born, we\u2019ve heard so many things like satellites living on grace to a Nigerian astronaut being in space by 2030 to supposed mini rocket launches.\n\nWhat\u2019s the real story, though? And why should you even care? Ogheneruemu has been doing some digging and has some answers for you. The time is 10 a.m; you might want to set a reminder for this.\n\nOZ\u00c9\u2019s $3m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOZ\u00c9 team source: TechCrunch\n\nGhanian fintech startup, OZ\u00c9, has raised a $3m pre-Series A led by Speedinvest. Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund, Savannah Fund and some angel investors also invested. This new funding is coming after a $700k seed financing in January 2021.\n\nWhat does OZ\u00c9 do? The startup helps small businesses go from pen and paper to running their operations digitally.\n\nIt also provides basic data necessary for business growth and access to capital that can help scale or keep the business afloat. OZ\u00c9 sets itself apart from similar platforms by including business coaching and digitised payments, all in one platform.\n\nLast year, OZ\u00c9 said it saw a 1200% increase in active users, bringing total active users on the platform to 125,000.\n\nAccording to Co-Founder and COO, Dave Emmett, \u201cthe last decade has seen a huge transformation in the digitisation of business accelerated by the pandemic.\u201d\n\nEmmett said this has increased the demand for financial solutions such as accepting payments and securing loans to keep businesses running.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe funding will be used to increase the capabilities of OZ\u00c9 and provide accessible financing to small businesses in Ghana and Nigeria.\n\n500 solar mini-grids for Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria could be getting 500 solar mini-grids within the next five years as Husk Power Systems, a rural energy services company, has pledged to build 5000 mini-grids and establish 1 million connections in Africa and Asia.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the company revealed this pledge yesterday, January 26, 2022, at the signing of an Energy Compact with the United Nations (UN) to grow its energy market in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\n\nAn Energy Compact is a voluntary commitment to the UN by companies, member states or even NGOs to achieve clean, affordable energy for all by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nHow much power can solar mini-grids provide? According to the World Bank, mini-grids can provide electricity to about 500 million people, but it will cost $225 billion. It also estimates that to achieve universal electricity by 2030, 40% of electricity needs to be from mini-grids.\n\nHusk Power System\u2019s commitment could break the ice when it comes to providing electricity for Africa.

Nigeria is the fourth-largest producer of cashew nuts in Africa and sixth globally, with 160,000 metric [\u2026]\n\nNigeria\u2019s cashew output is expected to rise 20 percent on favourable weather conditions, which have helped boost output for the 2021/22 season to an estimated 192,000 tons, the national president of the National Cashew Association of Nigeria, has said.\n\nNigeria is the fourth-largest producer of cashew nuts in Africa and sixth globally, with 160,000 metric tons per annum, according to data from the country\u2019s agriculture ministry.\n\n\u201cThe weather condition has been very favourable with moderate harmattan. Most of the trees we have seen across key growing states are fruiting well,\u201d Ojo Ajanaku, national president, National Cashew Association of Nigeria (NCAN), said.\n\n\u201cWe expect our output to increase by at least 20 percent this year. Also, a lot of new trees will start fruiting this year and that will also contribute to our output for the year,\u201dAjanaku said.\n\nThe quality of the nuts will also be very good owing to the mild harmattan that will help in reducing the level of heat during the storage of the crop, he noted.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 omicron variant uncertainty, accelerating inflation, increasing shipping and logistic cost, demand for Nigeria\u2019s cashew crop has remained strong on the back of cashew being an immunity-boosting food.\n\nCashew farmers in Africa\u2019s most populous expect prices to hit an average of N500,000 per metric ton on the decline in Indian production and surging demand from Vietnam and Asia.\n\n\u201cWe are already getting orders and we expect prices to surge. There has been a global commodity rally and cashew will not be left out,\u201d Tola Faseru, president, African Cashew Alliance, said, noting, \u201c2020/2021 cashew season was not too favourable to farmers as the Covid restrictions in Vietnam, America, and Europe affected demand.\u201d\n\nCountries are now relaxing restrictions and the demand for the nut is rising, he stated.\n\nLast year, Nigeria\u2019s cashew industry suffered a major setback as the COVID-19 restriction forced Vietnam, the largest exporter and buyer of African cashew, to cut demand.\n\nRead also: Address insecurity to boost food production in 2022, farmers urge FG\n\nAlso, surging freight prices and shortage of containers further impacted the season negatively for the farmers.\n\nCashew in Nigeria is usually harvested between February and June, though farmers stock the crop and export it all year round.\n\nIt has become a top-notch cash crop in Nigeria and it is one of the focused commodities by the Buhari-led government to revamp the Nigerian economy.\n\nIt can be eaten and also serves as industrial raw materials in firms producing chemicals, paints, varnishes, insecticides and fungicides, electrical conductress, and several types of oil, and also for the food and beverage industry.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria earned N42.9 billion from cashew nuts export in the first nine months of 2021, and 70 percent of the total nuts for the period were exported to Vietnam.\n\n\u201cWe have even started harvesting our cashew and drying to start exporting,\u201d said Debo Thomas from his cashew farm in Ogbomosho, Oyo State, saying, \u201cThe trees are doing very well and we are very hopeful that prices will be better this year than last year.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of Nigeria\u2019s cashew nuts and kernels are exported to Asia, Europe, and the United States.\n\nCashew crops can be grown in the entire South-West, South-South, and South-East region, with Enugu, Oyo, Anambra, Osun and Kogi having the largest production areas.\n\n\u201cWe have started getting requests from Vietnam and Japan to supply cashew, so we are very optimistic about the season,\u201d said Bankole Olukorede, a cashew trader in Lagos.\n\n\u201cI visited Ogbomosho, and farmers have started harvesting and drying.

According to BusinessDay analysis, UNCTAD reported an increase of 100 percent in FDI to $4.8 billion in 2021, the highest in eight years, while NBS reported a [\u2026]\n\nUnited Nations Conferences on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) data on Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows vary from the data reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nAccording to BusinessDay analysis, UNCTAD reported an increase of 100 percent in FDI to $4.8 billion in 2021, the highest in eight years, while NBS reported a decline of 56.2 percent to $340.4 million in the first nine months, the lowest in six years.\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says the contradiction may be as a result of the different methodologies that both institutions use for capturing FDI.\n\n\u201cNBS may not have a comprehensive investment tracker compared to UNCTAD. So, I think they need to improve on their reporting of FDI by telling us the key investments that drove those figures, who the core investors are, where they are coming from and other necessary information,\u201d Adewale notes.\n\nIn an emailed response to BusinessDay questions, Astrit Sulstarova, chief, trends and data section at UNCTAD, states, \u201cThe increase of FDI flows to Nigeria was mainly due to the rise in equity flows from $1.7 billion to $4.2 billion.\u201d\n\nSulstarova could not provide more information on the sectors responsible for the growth as it would be made available in the 2022 World Investment Report planned to be published in June.\n\nThe difference in UNCTAD and NBS\u2019 FDI reports could be that the former accounts for investments in the technology sector.\n\nWhen analysing the previous year\u2019s report, UNCTAD predicted that although the overall value of planned project finance and greenfield investments fell considerably, a few large deals announced in 2020 signalled that foreign investors were engaged despite the unfavourable investment climate.\n\n\u201cFor example, MTN Group (South Africa) announced it would invest $1.6 billion to strengthen its 4G network services in Nigeria,\u201d the report states.\n\nFDI is regarded as one of the most important contributors to economic growth. It is critical for developing and emerging markets as it creates new jobs and more opportunities, as investors build new companies in foreign countries.\n\nAnalysts say the recovery in FDI is a positive development for the economy. \u201cThroughout last year, there were a lot of fintech investments. However, we are not seeing those investments in critical sectors that will grow the economy,\u201d Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, says.\n\nSimilarly, Gbolahan Ologunro, a senior research analyst at Cordros Securities, notes that the country is getting more stable and long-term inflows that would probably not put pressure on the currency when there is a shock in oil prices.\n\n\u201cThere was high liquidity in the global market last year as a result of loose monetary stimulus from global central banks. So, these funds have to find economies with strong long-term growth prospects,\u201d Ologunro notes.\n\nAccording to data compiled by BusinessDay, Nigerian fintechs raised record amounts of money in 2021, raising $799.1 million by 19 fintech companies.\n\nApart from Nigeria, there was also international growth in FDI as it recorded a strong rebound, up 77 percent to an estimated $1.65 trillion from $929 billion in 2020, surpassing its pre-COVID-19 level.\n\nFor Africa, FDI rose by 142.5 percent to $97 billion as most recipients across the continent saw a moderate rise in FDI; inflated by a single intra-firm financial transaction in South Africa ($41bn) in the second half of 2021.\n\nRead also: Experts harp on financial education, as TGI empowers young people for investment\n\nFDI inflows into developing economies increased by 30 percent to nearly $870 billion, with a growth acceleration in East and South-East Asia (+20%), a recovery to near pre-pandemic levels in Latin America and the Caribbean, and an uptick in West Asia.\n\nDeveloped economies saw the biggest rise by far, with FDI reaching an estimated $777 billion in 2021 \u2013 three times the exceptionally low level in 2020.\n\nIn Europe, more than 80 percent of the increase in flows was due to large swings in conduit economies. Inflows in the United States more than doubled, with the increase entirely accounted for by a surge in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As).\n\n\u201cInvestor confidence is strong in infrastructure sectors, supported by favourable long-term financing conditions, recovery stimulus packages, and overseas investment programmes,\u201d UNCTAD states in its recent investment trend monitor report.\n\nIt concluded that though the outlook for global FDI in 2022 is positive, the rebound growth rate in 2021 is unlikely to be repeated.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 rebound growth rate is unlikely to be repeated. The underlying trend \u2013 net of conduit flows, one-off transactions, and intra-firm financial flows \u2013 will remain relatively muted, as in 2021,\u201d the report states.\n\nIt also adds that international project finance in infrastructure sectors will continue to provide growth momentum.",

          "title": "Hospitals struggle to retain staff amid migration tsunami",
          "text": "The effect of mass migration of healthcare workers is biting harder and nudging towards an emergency situation even as top private hospitals that have pooled huge investment into operations struggle to retain skilled staff, according to BusinessDay finding.\n\nHospitals continue to face rejections despite offerings of a work setting that matches global standards, a pay level that doubles local average, or is at par with some foreign offers.\n\nVast and short experienced health workers are constantly migrating out of Nigeria even if it means little or no raise in their income. Hospitals are left to run with a constant cycle of fresh graduates who are often looking to enrich their credentials with the experience before leaving.\n\nA center manager at one of the private hospitals championing the reversal of medical tourism in Lagos informs BusinessDay that the management is considering bringing in equally skilled expatriates as a means to protect service delivery.\n\nHer hospital, for instance, lost close to 30 skilled workers between December and January, all leaving for destinations such as the UK, Canada, and the US, among others.\n\nThose who are yet to leave are actively processing their way out, taking different examinations.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in the hospital now, we are losing very skilled people and those that are available are applying to leave. I have a consultant close to 50 who earns up to N2 million monthly. He\u2019s leaving also and I can\u2019t stop him. He wants a better life for his family. A lady in patient service left for the US last week. It\u2019s so bad,\u201d she says, asking not to be mentioned.\n\nThe drought of health professionals is also hitting hard at another big private hospital with multi-specialties in one of Lagos major highbrow setups. BusinessDay understands that if the desertion continues at the current pace, the hospital\u2019s prospects of delivering world-class services could be dampened too early. It could even land in a double whammy where it struggles to keep both professionals and high-end patients from going abroad.\n\n\u201cThose you see applying for the jobs we have now are fresh out of school, and those that want to work in the health sector for one or two months to enrich their CV because it is very hard for them to get employed without work experience. We are at that point where it is either we pay our local people more money or we start importing Indians, as they are the closest to our economy,\u201d the center manager states.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nigeria has a ratio of 16.1 nurses to 10,000 people and one doctor to 5,000 patients, rather than one to 600.\n\nThe trend shows top private hospitals are no longer protected from the skill drought that has been challenging many government-run facilities for decades. The Federal Government had on several occasions acknowledged the shortage of healthcare experts without substantial actions to tackle the crisis. Rather, health workers are owed several months of salary and due allowances unpaid.\n\nA real tsunami\n\nDespite that shortage and a ban on recruitment, 1,334 Nigerian trained nurses joined the UK workforce between March and September 2021, marking an all-time high, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) of the United Kingdom data indicate.\n\nPopulation growth-based projections on Nigeria from 2016 to 2030 suggest that there would be a shortage of up to 140,000 nurses and midwives in 2030, compared to 2016.\n\nThe International Council of Nurses (ICN) on Monday said about 13 million nurses would be required over the next 10 years to fix the worsening nursing shortage from mass poaching from countries, including Nigeria.\n\nThe body, representing over 27 million nurses worldwide, says it anticipates a migration tsunami as wealthier countries find a quick fix to the pandemic fallout by pooling qualified hands out of poorer countries, deepening inequalities in access to healthcare further.\n\nAttractive remuneration packages, advanced working conditions, and immigration policies targeted at easing healthcare workers\u2019 emigration have effects as baits and major drivers of brain drain in lower-middle-income countries, the ICN report shows.\n\nRead also: Emigration: The old-new rage\n\nSuch a scale of nurses\u2019 exodus in emigrating countries such as Nigeria has seen the nursing workforce grow leaner.\n\nThe report notes that global inequalities in the availability of nursing personnel are largely income-driven, with a density of 9.1 nurses per 10,000 population in low-income countries compared with 107.7 per 10,000 population in high-income economies, a tenfold variation in nurse availability.\n\nNigeria falls among the countries accounting for the largest shortages, and population growth is expected to further push up demand for nurses, irrespective of the current workforce profile.\n\nMore than 550,000 foreign-trained nurses were working across 36 OECD member countries in 2019, which was a marked increase on the 460,000 recorded in 2011, according to an OECD analysis.\n\nThe share of foreign-trained nurses has increased particularly in Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland, with a steady growth also occurring in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US.\n\nThe US reports the highest number of registered international nurses, estimated at almost 197,000; the second was the UK with over 100,000 foreign-trained nurses, then Germany with 71,000, and Australia with 53,000.\n\nHoward Catton, CEO, ICN, who co-authored the report, says the findings underlined the severity of the shortages.\n\nWhile the situation was known hitherto as a persistent historical underfunding of nursing around the world, the latest information about nurse vacancies, their rates of intention to leave, and staff sickness rates is a compelling reason to now recognise the issue as a global crisis.\n\n\u201cWe already had a shortage of 6 million nurses at the start of the pandemic, but with the immense and relentless pressure of responding to COVID and the Omicron variant, and an avalanche of resignations and retirements anticipated, the world will need to recruit and retain up to 13 million nurses over the next decade,\u201d Catton states.\n\nAction agenda\n\nThe report says a long-term plan is needed to stem the tide of those leaving nursing because of the additional stresses resulting from COVID-19 and to create a new generation of nurses to grow the profession to meet the increased future demands of an aging global population.\n\nThe ICN is calling for urgent coordination of policies both at national and international levels to mitigate the effects of these shortages.\n\nAt the country level, it suggests that policy priorities are focused on ensuring adequate domestic training capacity and improving the retention of domestically trained nurses.\n\nThere also has to be increased commitment to supporting early access to full vaccination programmes for all nurses as well as all other interventions to improve sustainability risk that could be undermined without it.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Sokoto inaugurated a new three million metric tonnes per annum BUA Cement Sokoto Line 4 Factory, expressing delight that the Federal Government\u2019s policies on economic diversification, job creation and creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, were working.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the plant, described as the largest private sector employer of labour in the North-Western part of Nigeria, the President in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, pledged that his administration would continue to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of huge reserves of resources in different parts of the country.\n\nThe President recounted that in 1985 as the then Head of State, he was at the same location to commission the second line of the facility.\n\n\u201dToday, almost thirty-seven years later, to commission the fourth line is a very special day for me personally.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dAs you all know, one of the key economic pillars of our administration has been to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. This is necessary for job creation and indeed, for our economy and national security.\n\n\u201dIn the past few weeks, I visited Ogun and Kaduna States where I observed many private sector investments in action. And today, I am here in Sokoto to commission this multi-billion Naira project.\n\n\u201dIt is therefore very clear for all to see that our policies are working. Progress is gradually being made in all parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President thanked the Founder of BUA Cement, Abdul Samad Rabiu and the entire team for the great work they are doing in supporting the government\u2019s economic diversification and job creation agenda.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that the company, which has completed four new cement plants of similar capacity in the last five years in different parts of the country and is set to complete two more plants soon, had shown through these investments that they believe in Nigeria and its potential.\n\nCommending BUA and other entrepreneurs for making Nigeria self-sufficient in cement and a net exporter of the strategic product, the President said: \u201dI am pleased that through these investments, BUA Cement has created employment opportunities for our citizens. Today, BUA is the largest employer of labour in the North-West region.\n\n\u201dI always remind Nigerians that every region, indeed every State, in Nigeria sits on huge reserves of resources. For example, in this area, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara can boast of rice production, gold and other precious metals development and of course, heavy industries like cement manufacturing.\n\n\u201dAs a Government, we introduced policies and mechanisms to support such investments in a legal, ethical and inclusive manner.\n\n\u201dFor example, we have the National Food Security Council on Food Security Matters and the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative to develop local artisanal gold mining and ensure health and safety of mining workers and protect the environment.\n\n\u201dWe remain prepared to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of these opportunities through value addition so as to take advantage of the huge market here, as well as in the greater African region and the world at large.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHighlighting other efforts to bring even development to all parts of the country, the President expressed confidence that the Ajaokuta\u2013Kaduna\u2013Kano (AKK) gas project, when completed, will bring gas for domestic and industrial purposes from the South South region to the South East, North Central and North West Geopolitical zones.\n\nHe said the AKK project would significantly reduce cost of operations for industries in the regions.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to reassure Nigerians that his government would continue to invest heavily in roads and rails to ease movement of people, goods and services, with a view to facilitating trade while lowering logistics costs associated with the inefficiencies of bad roads and bridges.\n\nOn security, President Buhari reiterated his commitment to bring peace and stability to all parts of Nigeria, listing a raft of measures undertaken by this administration to ensure that normalcy returns to the country.\n\n\u201dWe continue to recruit and equip security personnel while expanding our social investment programs to support the youth and some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n\n\u201dYou should all be reassured that we will win this battle against the criminal elements looking to destabilize our nation by hindering the progress of our economy.\n\n\u201dI want to now call on all entrepreneurs and businesses to emulate what is being done here.\n\n\u201dThe task of nation building requires all hands to be on deck. The public and private sectors must collaborate if we are to achieve our aim of collective peace and prosperity across the entire nation.\u201d\n\nAbdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman, BUA Cement, who commended the President for creating the enabling environment for businesses to thrive, acknowledged the support of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and its Governor in setting up the gigantic project.\n\nHe announced that, \u201dso far, we have invested over a billion dollars in the past four years and we urge the CBN to continue to support industries like ours that use locally sourced raw materials to add value.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that BUA would continue to invest more in the cement industry until Nigeria is self-sufficient and the commodity is made available, accessible, and affordable for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dIn the past 6 years, we have completed 4 plants \u2013 two in Obu, Edo State and two in Sokoto (of which this Sokoto line 4 is the fourth) with BUA\u2019s total production capacity now standing at 11.5million tonnes with the completion of this plant.\n\n\u201dNext year, we intend to complete the construction of two new plants of 3 million metric tonnes each for which construction is ongoing \u2013 one in Edo and the other, here in Sokoto,\u201d Rabiu said.\n\nRabiu added that he looked forward to President Buhari commissioning the plants next year which will bring total production capacity to 17.5million metric tonnes.",

          "text": "The House of Representatives, on Thursday, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to suspend the electronic evaluation and invoicing policy recently introduced in the import and export chain, warning that it may negatively affect revenue collection by the Nigeria Customs Service.\n\nGovernor of the CBN, Godwin Emefiele, is also to appear before the House Committee on Customs and Excise to explain the implication of the policy to Customs\u2019 revenue target in 2022.\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Customs and Excise, Leke Abejide, had moved a motion titled \u2018Call on the Central Bank of Nigeria to Suspend the Implementation of the new Guidelines on the Introduction of E-Evaluator, E-Invoicing for Imports and Exports Businesses in Nigeria.\u2019\n\nMoving the motion, Abejide recalled that the CBN, on January 21, 2022, issued a circular on guidelines on imports and exports businesses in Nigeria, with Reference Number TED/FEM/FPC/PUB/01/001 to take effect from February 1, 2022, 10 days after the issuance of the guidelines.\n\nThe lawmaker said \u201csudden monetary/fiscal circular hurriedly or half-hazard implemented\u201d often leads to policy summersault. For major policy change such as this, a grace period of 90 days is usually expected for transactions to run their full course to avoid distortion in the economy and price distortions of trade.\n\nAbejide said, \u201cThe House is worried that the CBN has gradually deviated from its primary function of monetary policy measures and bankers to government and concentrating more on fiscal policy measure which is the function of the Federal Ministry of Finance.\n\n\u201cThe House is concerned if the guidelines are not given adequate time to sensitise and acquaint the major ports of entry in the country for stakeholders and the general public to study the policy, it will distort prices of goods and services and create logjams for imports and exports, delay transactions and consequently cause ports congestion.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker recalled that in 2020, the immediate implementation of FORM NXP as a mandatory statutory document required to be completed by all exporters for shipment of goods outside the country resulted in crisis, as most exporters contracts were cancelled by their foreign buyers due to network issues and configuration of its portal, which takes more than two to three weeks to resolve thus leading to massive financial loss by exporters.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe House is worried that importers and exporters in the manufacturing, mining and trading sectors would be affected because as the exceptions indicate that all exporters and importers with a cumulative invoicing value equal to or above $500,000 or its equivalent in foreign currency would be affected which is practically impossible to have anyone below this value cumulatively.\n\n\u201cThe House is disturbed that some issues in the guidelines are contradictory for instance, guidelines (c) and (d) contradict each other, while guideline (c) states that no importer/exporter may effect payment to the credit of any foreign supplier unless the electronic invoice has been authenticated by authorised dealer\u2019s banks presented together with the relevant documents for payment. But guideline (d) states that the content of the electronic invoice authenticated by Authorised Dealer Banks is only advisory for the Nigeria Customs Service.\u201d\n\nAdopting the motion, the House urged the CBN to \u201csuspend the policy with immediate effect to enable adequate sensitization on the workability of the policy in all major ports of entry including seaports, airports and border stations.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers also invited \u201cthe Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria to brief the Committee on Customs and Excise, with the assurances that the target revenue of N3.1tn given to the Nigeria Customs Service by the Federal Government of Nigeria, which the NCS announced to the media that they are targeting N4.2tn, will not be distorted by this sudden policy implementation.\u201d\n\nAlso, the House urged the CBN to give a 90 days\u2019 timeline for subsequent new fiscal/monetary policy implementation to allow for adjustment in order to stabilise the economy.

I stand with the parents in the circumstance. The government will continue to do all it can to free our children who are being held for what they know nothing about.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said no nation could make meaningful progress with a high number of its youth as illiterates.\n\n\n\nAccording to the minister, the high number of out-of-school children was inimical to the growth and development of any nation.\n\nNwajiuba maintained that the Federal Ministry of Education was determined to ensure that all children of school age, who are out of school, are returned and retained to complete their basic and secondary education and possibly transit to tertiary institutions.\n\nThe minister called for synergy amongst stakeholders especially communities where such children exist to ensure that they are given the necessary support to achieve education, adding that this is the only way the country can achieve a better, reliable, developed and peaceful society.\n\nThe minister also called on state governments to upscale efforts in supporting the Federal Government in the task of educating children, adding that education was a collective responsibility.",

According to NAN, on July 24, 2020, the court ordered the former minister to appear before it and respond to the EFCC\u2019s money laundering accusation against her.\n\nAbdullah filed an ex parte motion with the court with the number FHC/ABJ/CR/208/2018. The EFCC had accused the former minister of fleeing the country for the United Kingdom, among other things, to avoid justice.\n\n\u201cHer role in the chartering of private jets by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Ministry of Petroleum Resources, as well as her role in the award of contracts by NNPC to Marine and Logistics Services Limited\u201d are among the claims leveled against Diezani.\n\n\u201cHer contribution to the general election financing in 2015\u201d\n\nThe EFCC also stated that it wanted the ex-minister to speak about several items, documents, and jeweleries found in her home at No. 10, Chiluba Close, off Jose Marti Street, Asokoro, Abuja, as well as some identified properties in Nigeria, the United Kingdom, the United States, the United Arab Emirate, and South Africa.\n\nThe EFCC chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, revealed that the anti-corruption commission seized 153 million dollars from Alison-Madueke in the April 2021 edition of the agency\u2019s in-house magazine.\n\nAccording to Bawa, the agency also made the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria worth around $80 million from the former minister, who has been living in the United Kingdom since leaving government a few years ago.",

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Wednesday denied zoning its 2023 presidential ticket to any part of southern Nigeria as being speculated in viral reports making the rounds in the media space.\n\nIn the reports which went viral Tuesday, the anonymous author of the report stated that the APC had zoned its presidential ticket to the South-East, while that of the Vice President was zoned to the North, with other key positions spread round the different geo-political regions in the country.\n\nDismissing the report in a statement, Director General, Press and Media Affairs to Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee of the APC Mamman Mohammed, quoted Governor Mai Mala Buni as saying there was no iota of truth in the report.\n\nThe Yobe state governor added that a decision on zoning of the party\u2019s tickets would only be taken at the convention of the party coming up in February.\n\n\u201cThe attention of His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Yobe State and Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Hon. Mai Mala Buni, has been drawn to media publications with purported zoning of offices allegedly announced by him,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nHe further said: \u201cHis Excellency has, in clear and unambiguous terms, denied the said list, saying, it is false, baseless, unfounded, misleading and has nothing to do with him.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee said the party has not taken any decision at any fora on anything relating to zoning of offices.\n\n\u201cThe publication is just a figment of the author\u2019s imagination that has nothing to do with the Chairman and the party. The public is hereby urged to disregard the purported list as it is misleading and completely false.\n\n\u201cGovernor Buni urged the press to resist unverified stories and rumours, and to always verify all issues related to the party assuring that the doors of the party are always open.\u201d\n\nOkorocha joins race\n\nIn a related development, the rank of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC swelled Wednesday with the declaration of Senator Rochas Okorocha (APC Imo West) for the contest.\n\nMaking the declaration Wednesday through a letter forwarded to Senate President Ahmad Lawan and read to other lawmakers, Okorocha said his joining the race was to offer Nigerians the leadership that would take Nigerians out of the wilderness .\n\nOkorocha, in the letter titled: \u201cNigerian President 2023 \u201c, said the country at the moment needed \u201d a detribalized Nigerian who can unite our country, a leader with a compassionate heart, who will care for the poor and downtrodden and the masses of our country, a visionary leader who can create wealth for our teaming populace thereby, addressing the issues of poverty, insecurity and youth restiveness.\u201d\n\nThe letter, in part, also informed the lawmakers of a proposed World Press Conference to be hosted by him Monday 31st January, 2022 at the Executive Hall of the International Conference Centre, Abuja at 11am.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, the Independent National Electoral Commission has announced the time table for the conduct of 2023 general election, including that of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith elections drawing nearer as the days go by, our citizens are concerned about the quality of persons to run the affairs of our nation, one who can address some of their major concerns.\n\n\u201cIt is as a result of these concerns that I wish to hold a world press conference on my intention to run for the office of the President of our dear Nation. I therefore wish to solicit for your prayers as I make known my intention\u201d, he said.\n\nAvailable records show that Okorocha is a 3-time presidential aspirant who made his first outing 20 years ago on the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party(ANPP).\n\nHe sought the party\u2019s ticket alongside Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, Chief Nnia Nwodo and Chief Harry Akande.\n\nIn 2007, he ran on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) coming second to late President Umar Musa Yar\u2019adua in a contest that also had Prof Jerry Gana, Gen. Mohammed Gusau and Gen. Buba Marwa.\n\nSaraki too\n\nSimilarly, former Senate President Bukola Saraki has indicated interest to contest the 2023 presidency.\n\nHis declaration is coming after former National Leader of the All Progressives Congress Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Ebonyi Governor Dave Umahi, Senate Chip Whip Orji Kalu and former Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha declared a similar interest.\n\nThe two-term governor said he has a strong record of delivering and experience in making tough decisions.\n\nBorn December 19, 1962,? Saraki is the son of Second Republic Senator, late Olusola Saraki.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us.\n\n\u201cJoin me to make our communities safer and provide real opportunities for you and your families.

          "text": "Not less than 387 lives were lost to communal clashes in Kauru and Zangon Kataf local government areas of Kaduna state in 2020 and 2021, Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai stated this Wednesday at an emergency security meeting with traditional rulers, religious and community leaders from the areas.\n\nHe said the lives were lost to clashes among Atyap, Fulani, Chawai, Irigwe and Hausa ethnic communities in the two areas.\n\nThe meeting was held at the palace of the Agwatyap, A\u0320tak Njei, in Zangon Kataf.\n\nThe governor was represented by Commissioner for Home Affairs and Internal Security Samuel Aruwan and accompanied to the meeting by heads of security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe are here on behalf of the governor following the renewed killings in Kauru and Zangon Kataf local government areas. It is a big setback but we will not relent.\n\n\u201cWe are reiterating our appeal for recourse to the law and avoidance of generalisations. These killings and counter killings are unjustifiable,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving the figure, Aruwan said: \u201cFor instance in 2020, 114 citizens were killed in Zangon Kataf and 28 in Kauru, and in 2021, 186 were killed in Zangon Kataf and 59 in Kauru, and if you put the figures, we lost 387 people in these two councils. In 2021, 100 citizens \u2018incurred\u2019 gunshot injuries in the two councils, 77 in Zangon Kataf and 23 in Kauru.\n\n\u201cThis is aside houses and settlements burnt, farms destroyed, cattle killed and collapse of the rural economy affecting all the communities.\n\n\u201cWe must rise to the occasion and put a stop to all these challenges, arising from the behaviour of a few elements on all sides. Let us reason together and avert this needless bloodshed.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, member House of Representatives for Zangon Kataf/Jaba Federal Constituency, Amos Magaji, supported the appeal for a recourse to the law and campaign for peace in the areas.\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Agwatyap, Dominic Yahaya, and Res-Tsam (Chief of Chawai), Yahaya Mohammed, pledged their support for the drive for sustainable peace and development in the areas.\n\nAlso speaking at the meeting, Chairman of Zangon Kataf local government area, Francis Sani, and his Kauru counterpart, Bashir Dawaki, also commended Governor El-Rufai \u201cfor dispatching a high-powered delegation to the areas following recent killings and counter killings.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Commander Sector 7 of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) Tony Opurum expressed concern over the incessant killings and lawlessness in the areas.\n\nOpurum, an army colonel, said the military would continue to work hard in containing threats to peace in the areas.\n\nSimilarly, Area Commander Kafanchan Police Area Command Danladi Ibrahim said: \u201cThe Police will continue to be neutral and prosecute anyone found guilty.\u201d\n\nThe meeting ended with all sides agreeing to deepen the campaign for peace and continue the engagements in all communities.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the participants appealed to the state government to resolve the land tussle lingering in Zangon Kataf since the 1992 crisis.\n\nThe Kaduna state government thanked the Center for Democracy and Development (CDD) for accepting to organise peace and security engagements in the two local government areas beginning from February 2022.\n\nACF fumes\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has expressed worries over the incessant killings of innocent citizens in the North, noting that from civilisation, Nigeria was fast returning to barbarism.\n\nACF National Chairman Chief Audu Ogbeh made the remark Wednesday while addressing its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Kaduna.\n\nOn the recent killing of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar in Kano, the setting ablaze of 20 passengers in Sokoto and reported cases of bullying and sodomy in schools across the country, he said Nigeria cannot afford to return to barbarism after civilisation.\n\nHe said the APC would support a presidential candidate for the forthcoming 2023 presidential election, who has the capacity to move Nigeria out of the present security and economic challenges currently facing the nation.\n\nHe said the Forum would meet with their counterparts from other regions, like Afenifere, Ohanaeze, South South People Movement to discuss on peace building and consensus among the various regions.\n\n\u201cWe are having experiences which are very scary, a five-year-old girl killed by a school proprietor in Kano, 20 people were locked in a vehicle in Sokoto and set ablaze. It is a terrible thing. We appealed to proprietors of schools and government to take measures to stop these heinous crimes in our schools.\n\n\u201cHorrible things are happening even in government schools and military institutions. Many bad things are happening, bullying, sodomy all kinds of things are rumoured. Government must try very hard to bring order to these schools. We are very concerned about these developments, our country cannot return to barbarism after experiencing civilization.\n\n\u201cThere are economic challenges everywhere, people are finding it difficult to feed their family, kidnapping along highways, relentless criminalities. Farmers cannot go to their farms to harvest their crop, they have to pay taxes to be allowed to harvest their crops and farming is our main occupation in the North.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very delicate period; it is for these reasons that we are not having too many meetings because we don\u2019t want anybody coming for these meetings to be affected on the highways.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 election is on the way, people would meet you and ask if ACF is endorsing anyone or if ACF is supporting anyone, make it clear to them that we are not political parties, that the parties have not told us their candidates yet. After the candidates are picked by their parties, they will come to talk to us, they will give us their agenda, then we will know who to support.\n\n\u201cWe are not a political party but we hope we will get a good person who will lead Nigeria out of the circumstances in which we found ourselves. We have not had it this bad and it should not continue for too long.\n\n\u201cWe commend the Governor of Kaduna state for the wonderful job he is doing trying to change a semi rural town to a semi urban state. We also commend the Governor of Kano state for closing down that school and revoking the licenses of other private schools.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting with our counterparts from other regions, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, South South People Movement to discuss with them on building peace and consensus among the various regions. We have not held these meetings yet due to few obstacles. We need to appeal for peace and understanding to stop abusing and quarrelling with each other which does not make any sense and does not stand well for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cShould there be chaos here, where do we go as refugees? Refugees don\u2019t carry more than Ghana must go bag, you don\u2019t carry your car, your Television set, your microwave. We don\u2019t want chaos to take place,\u201d he said.",

We use the Delsa to detect if there is somebody that is alive and I said this type of collapse building, it\u2019s unique itself.\n\n\u201cWhen it piles on one another there won\u2019t be air going in, it will compress the victim, and the way our response was operated, we divided the place into quadrums. We used a Delsa and drone; I can say that that probability is close to zero.\u201d\n\nContinuing the cross-examination, Mr. Adeosun asked, \u201cAre you telling this court that before moving your equipment, you must have confirmed that there is no person alive?\u201d\n\nThe witness replied, \u201c100 per cent yes, My Lord. There was nobody that died in the course of our intervention to the best of my knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe collapse of the 21-storey high-rise building, located at Gerard Road, Ikoyi, resulted in the death of 46 persons one of whom was the MD of Fourscore Heights Ltd, Mr Femi Osibona. He was handling the construction of the high-rise.\n\nAt the proceeding, the coroner also listened to the conclusion of the testimony of Mr. Muritala Olawale, a structural engineer and the Managing Director of Prowess Engineering Nigeria Ltd.\n\nThe witness, tendered documents on the soil test conducted which were admitted by the coroner as an exhibit.\n\nAt the proceedings of Wednesday, the 15th of Dec., Olawale had told the coroner that he rendered structural consultancy services to the contractor of the project, the late MD of Fourscore Heights Ltd, Mr Osibona.\n\nOlawale said the initial brief his firm received was for three blocks of four-storey buildings.\n\nHe said that Osibona kept revising the brief by adding more floors to the buildings and that his team was only responsible for the first four floors of the 21-storey Block B which collapsed.\n\nOlawale told the inquest that Osibona was the contractor/builder of the project and was also in charge of getting all government approvals for the high-rises.\n\n\u201cI never saw the approved architectural drawings, mechanical drawings, and electronic drawings for the project,\u201d he said.\n\nThe structural engineer noted that when he realised that standard construction procedures were not being observed on the site, his company withdrew its services to Osibona via a letter dated Feb. 20, 2020\n\nFurther hearing in the inquest has been adjourned to February 4, 2022.",

But since last year, he has faced a wave of discontent about armed groups\u2019 attacks that have killed some 2,000 people and forced a million and a half to flee their homes.\n\nOn Sunday, mutinies erupted in several army barracks a day after police dispersed banned protests, and on Monday, the army rebels brought the country under the control of the Patriotic Movement for Preservation and Restoration (MPSR), a military government led by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba.\n\nThe MPSR has announced the suspension of the constitution and dissolution of the government and parliament with Damiba saying on Monday that it would propose a return to constitutional order \u201cwithin a reasonable time frame\u201d.\n\nECOWAS said on Monday that Kabore was forced to resign under threat and intimidation.\n\nWest Africa has been rattled by three military coups in less than 19 months, beginning with Mali in 2020 and Guinea in September 2021.\n\nIn August 2020, army officers deposed Mali\u2019s elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who had likewise been facing protests for his handling of the country\u2019s violence.\n\nECOWAS has already slapped broad sanctions on Mali, where the military-led government said this month it planned to hold power through 2025, going back on a previous agreement to organise elections this February.\n\nGuinea underwent a coup in September last year, when officers toppled President Alpha Conde, 83, who had been president since 2010.\n\nHe sparked mass protests when he changed the constitution to allow himself to seek a third term at the ballot box.\n\nBoth Guinea and Mali have been suspended from ECOWAS, and the bloc has imposed an array of sanctions against those countries.",

          "title": "Elon Musk Space Rocket on Collision Course with the Moon",
          "text": "A chunk of a SpaceX rocket that blasted off seven years ago and was abandoned in space after completing its mission will crash into the Moon in March, experts say.\n\nThe rocket was deployed in 2015 to put into orbit a NASA satellite called the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR).\n\nSince then, the second stage of the rocket, or booster, has been floating in what mathematicians call a chaotic orbit, astronomer Bill Gray said on Wednesday.\n\nIt was Gray who calculated the space junk\u2019s new collision course with the Moon. The booster passed quite close to the Moon in January in a rendezvous that altered its orbit, said Gray.\n\nHe is behind Project Pluto, software that allows scientists to calculate the trajectory of asteroids and other objects in space and is used in NASA-financed space observation programs.\n\nA week after the rocket stage whizzed close to the Moon, Gray observed it again and concluded it would crash into the Moon\u2019s dark side on March 4 at more than 9,000km/h (5,500 mph).\n\nGray appealed to the amateur astronomer community to join him in observing the booster, and his conclusion was confirmed.\n\nThe exact time and location of impact may change slightly from his forecast but there is widespread agreement that there will be a collision on the Moon that day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking junk of this sort for about 15 years. And this is the first unintentional lunar impact that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Gray said.\n\nAstronomer Jonathan McDowell said, however, the effects of the collision will be minor, adding it is possible similar impacts have taken place unnoticed.\n\n\u201cThere are at least 50 objects that were left in deep Earth orbit in the 60s, 70s and 80s that were just abandoned there. We didn\u2019t track them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re picking up a couple of them \u2026 but a lot of them we\u2019re not finding and so they\u2019re not there any more,\u201d he added. \u201cProbably at least a few of them hit the moon accidentally and we just didn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the chunk of SpaceX rocket, which weighs four tonnes, on the Moon will not be visible from Earth in realtime.\n\nBut it will leave a crater that scientists will be able to observe with spacecraft and satellites such as NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or India\u2019s Chandrayaan-2, and thus learn more about the geology of the Moon.\n\nSpacecraft have been intentionally crashed into the Moon before for scientific purposes, such as during the Apollo missions to test seismometers.\n\nIn 2009, NASA sent a rocket stage hurling into the Moon near its south pole to look for water.\n\nBut most rockets do not go so far from Earth. SpaceX brings its rocket boosters back through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so they disintegrate over the ocean. The first stage is recovered and reused.\n\nGray said there could be more unintentional crashes into the Moon in the future as the US and Chinese space programmes, in particular, leave more junk in orbit.\n\nThe US, together with international partners, is already planning a space station to orbit the Moon.\n\nMcDowell noted these events \u201cstart to be problematic when there\u2019s a lot more traffic\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually no one\u2019s job to keep track of the junk that we leave out in deep earth orbit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think now\u2019s the time to start regulating it.\u201d\n\nSpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s company is currently developing a lunar lander that should allow NASA to send astronauts back to the Moon by 2025 at the earliest.",

          "text": "Prince Andrew has denied being a close friend of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, in a legal response to the woman who is suing him in the US for sexual assault.\n\nLawyers for the prince also say he wants to go before a jury to contest the claim brought by Virginia Giuffre.\n\nThe Duke of York has consistently denied all the allegations against him.\n\nMs Giuffre alleges he assaulted her when she was 17 at homes owned by Maxwell and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBut in the 11-page court document, filed on Wednesday, Prince Andrew\u2019s legal team list a number of reasons why they believe her civil lawsuit should be dismissed.\n\nOne factor they ask the court to consider is the issue of consent.\n\nThe document says: \u201cAssuming, without admitting, that Giuffre has suffered any injury or damage alleged in the complaint, Giuffre\u2019s claims are barred by the doctrine of consent.\u201d\n\nThe document also states that Prince Andrew \u201cadmits that he met Epstein in or around 1999\u201d, but denies that he participated in any abuse with the late financier.\n\nOn the matter of a photograph of the prince with his arm around Ms Giuffre, with Maxwell in the background, his lawyers say they do not have enough information to admit or deny its existence.\n\nElsewhere, the document \u201cdenies\u201d Ms Guiffre\u2019s claim that Prince Andrew was a close friend of Maxwell.\n\nWriting to a US judge, his lawyers state: \u201cPrince Andrew hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted in the complaint.\u201d\n\nUS lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents a number of Maxwell\u2019s and Epstein\u2019s accusers, called this demand a \u201cPR move\u201d, saying Ms Giuffre had already asked for a jury trial.\n\nShe said Prince Andrew\u2019s request was \u201cmeaningless\u201d as it was Ms Giuffre\u2019s constitutional right to have a jury trial if she asked for one.\n\nPrince Andrew has shown he\u2019s ready to fight this out in court, firmly rejecting all the claims against him.\n\nEven that infamous photograph with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell is pushed back as unproven.\n\n\u201cPrince Andrew lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegation that there exists photographic evidence of his alleged meeting with Giuffre,\u201d says his legal response.\n\nHis legal team are not giving any ground, with a robust denial of any wrongdoing and attacking the validity of the claims against him.\n\nPrince Andrew is now contesting this case as a private citizen and this latest move paves the way for a bombshell trial in the autumn.\n\nBut Buckingham Palace will not relish such thunder clouds hanging over the Platinum Jubilee year.\n\nAnd even though both sides will be flexing their legal muscles and talking tough, it doesn\u2019t rule out negotiations for a settlement.\n\nBut if that doesn\u2019t happen, Prince Andrew has shown he\u2019s ready to put his case to a New York jury.\n\nIn the papers, Prince Andrew\u2019s lawyers further argue that Ms Giuffre has no legal basis to bring the case since she is a permanent resident of Australia.\n\nThey also refer to a 2009 settlement agreement between Ms Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, a longtime associate of Prince Andrew.\n\nEpstein, a convicted sex offender, killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial. British socialite Maxwell was found guilty last month of grooming underage girls to be abused by him.\n\nMs Giuffre is suing the Queen\u2019s son for allegedly sexually assaulting her in London, New York and the Virgin Islands when she was a teenager.\n\nShe is seeking unspecified damages, but there is speculation the sum could be in the millions of dollars.\n\nEarlier in the month, a judge ruled that the case could proceed.\n\nBuckingham Palace later stripped Prince Andrew of his military titles and patronages, and said he would contest the case as a private individual.\n\nThe new court documents describe the Queen\u2019s second son as \u201cPrince Andrew, Duke of York aka Andrew Albert Christian Edward, in his personal capacity\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, David Boies \u2013 who is representing Ms Giuffre \u2013 said his client and legal team \u201clook forward to confronting Prince Andrew with his denials and attempts to blame Ms Giuffre for her own abuse at his deposition and at trial\u201d.",
