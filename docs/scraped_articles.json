          "text": "The Presidency and the All Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigeria on Wednesday clashed over the Federal Government\u2019s claim on the registration of farmers.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Agriculture, Andrew Kwasari, in an interview with The PUNCH, said more than six million farmers had been registered by the Federal Government for the purpose of giving them subsidy.\n\nBut the National President of AFAN, Kabir Ibrahim, told The PUNCH that the association was not aware of the programme.\n\nHe stated that what should be of importance to government was how to address rising food prices caused by insecurity.\n\nIbrahim added that government should not claim it had spent billions of naira on data capturing of farmers.\n\nAlso, cotton growers said they were not involved in the exercise.\n\nThe Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, had at the fourth meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development on June 17, said government had created an online portal to register 10 million farmers, adding that the exercise would capture their biographies, geographical information of their farmlands, crops, and volumes of what they could produce.\n\nAccording to him, the database will be a platform for the Federal Government interventions and put an end to ghost schemes and other unscrupulous practices in the agricultural industry.\n\nHe disclosed that the programme initially planned to capture 2.4 million farmers across the country, but the results from it encouraged government to expand the target to 10 million.\n\nBut the National President of AFAN, Ibrahim, in the interview with The PUNCH, denied knowledge of the exercise.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am not aware of any of such and we have not been registered. We are not part of what they are doing.\n\n\u201cI think what should be of importance to government now is how to address the rising food prices occasioned by the inability of farmers to go to their farms due to insecurity.\n\n\u201cThey should not come and tell us that they are spending billions to capture farmers\u2019 data or to registers farmers in Nigeria. We are not aware or part of it.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Lagos State Chairman of the association, Chief Femi Oke, said he was not aware of the programme. \u201cI am not aware of any registration or data capturing exercise yet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Bauchi State, the Chairman of the association, Mahmoud Yakubu, in an interview with The PUNCH, stated, \u201cIn my capacity as Chairman of Bauchi state farmers\u2019 association, I am not aware of that. Just as you heard it was how I also heard it. What I am saying is that the Federal Government is supposed to carry us along.\n\n\u201cBefore we are registered, the organ responsible will give us the terms of reference and from there, we will know what to expect but I can\u2019t just say this is what we will expect without knowing what they want to do.\u201d\n\nHis counterpart in Osun State, Alhaji Sulaimon Araokanmi, said the only registration done by farmers in the state was for those that recorded losses during #EndSARS protest and flooding of 2020.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have 52 commodities in the state and every commodity has a leader. I am the overall leader of all the farmers in the state. We have representatives for yam farmers, poultry farmers, fish farmers and others. So, I may not know if members of sub-groups under AFAN have been asked to register.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe registration that I am aware of in the state is for those affected by flood last year and it was done throughout the country. Those that suffered losses during #EndSARS protest were also told to register.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of Cotton Farmers\u2019 Association in the state, Sulaimon Akande, said members of his group were not aware of any registration by either the state or the Federal Government.\n\nBut the Chairman of the Cross River State branch of the Rice Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigera, Oliver Ntui, when contacted on the phone, said he was aware of the registration, but his association was not involved.\n\nAlso, his counterpart in Sokoto State, Saliu Ibrahim, said there were various forms of registration, which rice farmers in the state were involved.\n\nIbrahim, who spoke to one of our correspondents on the phone said, \u201cYes, rice farmers in Sokoto have been involved in various registration, be it the Anchor Borrower Scheme and various farmers groups.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of AFAN in Benue State, Aondongu Saaku, told The PUNCH that the Federal Ministry of Agriculture was in charge of the registration of farmers in the state.\n\nThe AFAN boss said that the registration was being done in conjunction with Benue State Rural Agricultural Development Agency .\n\nHe explained that the farmers were expected to be given fertilisers and some farming tools. He stated, \u201cThe registration is not done by AFAN but by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and BERNADA.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve registered six million, only political farmers denying exercise, says Buhari\u2019s aide\n\nThe Director of Information in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development , Theodore Ogaziechi, told one of our correspondents that the registration was being handled by the Presidency.\n\n\u201cThat thing is being done in the Presidency and is headed by the President\u2019s special assistant on agriculture. I think you should call him as that is his project,\u201d Ogaziechi said.\n\nWhen contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Agriculture, Kwasari, took a swipe at associations, which stated that they were not aware of the registration.\n\nIn the interview with The PUNCH, he insisted that over six million farmers had been captured regardless of the denial by the associations.\n\nRegistration not for political farmers, subsidy will be given to genuine ones, not ghosts, says presidential aide\n\nWhen told that many farmers denied knowledge of the registration by government, Kwasari said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what farmers you are talking about now because in Nigeria there are political farmers and there are farmers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve captured over six million and very soon we will be giving direct subsidy to registered farmers. So let\u2019s wait and see whether spirits will be the ones to receive the subsidy.\u201d\n\nAgain when reminded that AFAN said it was unaware of the programme, the presidential aide argued that he visited the president of the association to show him the number of registered farmers in Nigeria.\n\nKwasari said, \u201cI told you that we have political farmers and they will tell you that they are not aware. I went to their president, where he was lodging in Garki (Abuja), I even took the list of his own state of over 400,000 farmers registered in Katsina.\n\nI visited, challenged association head to call any of 400,000 farmers on the phone \u2013 Presidential aide\n\n\u201cI said he should call any of those 400,000 persons. I was in his hotel room for two and half hours with the entire volumes of his state. We have the database of all the farmers in the 36 states and Abuja and this is by wards and local governments.\u201d\n\nThe AFAN president, however, countered the claims of Kwasari, as he told The PUNCH that no farmer had said he was captured despite claims by the government.\n\nIbrahim said, \u201cHe (Kwasari) came to my hotel room and spent two and half hours with documents that he said they had used to register farmers, but I was not convinced.\n\n\u201cI am the president of all farmers\u2019 association and we have chapters in the 36 states and in the 774 local governments. If they are actually registering farmers, don\u2019t you think one farmer will call me or call one of the executives to tell us that farmers are being captured?\n\n\u201cNobody, no single farmer has called me or any of our executives to say that farmers are being captured.\u201d\n\nIbrahim explained that a meeting was held sometime ago on the issue. He said the meeting involved the Office of the Chief of Staff to the President and some governors.\n\nAt a meeting with Presidency officials, Kebbi gov said no registration was done \u2013 Association\n\nHe said, \u201cThey brought out what they had done. The Governor of Kebbi State said as far as the governors were concerned, there was no such thing going on.\n\n\u201cThey said they were working with commissioners and directors of agriculture, but the governor said the commissioner for agriculture works directly with him and that the commissioner told him (governor) that he (commissioner) was not aware.\u201d\n\nIbrahim stated that the governors made it clear that they were not aware during the meeting, stressing that it looked as if it was only Kwasari and the agric minister were the ones running the registration. How much are you (the officials) spending per person? The EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission) is looking at this issue.\n\n\u201cYou are on one side saying farmers are being captured, while farmers are on the other side saying they are not being captured.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "With only about five per cent of agricultural crops in Nigeria insured, operators see this as a threat to food security, OKECHUKWU NNODIM writes\n\nThe insurance of crops in Nigeria\u2019s agricultural sector is low as most farmers across the country shy away from insuring their crops and produce.\n\nAgro-insurers, government officials as well as farmers believe that it is vital to insure crops, particularly to forestall the devastating impact of adverse weather on crop production.\n\nOperators in the sector see the about five per cent level of agriculture insurance in Nigeria as another potential threat to food security nationwide.\n\nAlthough many farmers agreed to the fact that it was vital to insure their crops, the concern of trust in insurance companies and the non-payment of claims by these firms had been sources of discouragement.\n\nSome of them also claimed that insurance companies were selective of the type of agricultural insurance offers to make available to farmers.\n\nHowever, insurance firms insisted that they had been engaging in series of enlightenment campaigns across Nigerian states to make farmers appreciate why they should insure their produce.\n\nThe Head, Agric and Micro-insurance Division, Leadway Assurance Company, Fatono Ayoola, said operators in the agro-insurance sector had been working hard on how to use insurance to guarantee food security for Nigeria.\n\nAyoola, who spoke in Abuja, observed that agriculture was a very risky venture in Nigeria, especially when in the production value chain.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is the chain where you go to the field to cultivate a particular crop or to raise animals in poultry or others. You are faced with a lot of risks as an investor in that particular sector.\n\n\u201cIn these days of climate change, you often have erratic weather patterns that can consistently impact negatively on your investments in the field. As you may have observed in this country, for the past three or four years there have been consistent flooding and rainfall.\n\n\u201cNow, assuming you are a farmer who cultivates crops in the region of consistent flooding, you may stop the investment if you do not have anything to fall back on after flood disaster hits your investment.\n\n\u201cThat is why insurance has become a very good tool in securing your investment when the unexpected happens. This is because weather events are purely beyond man\u2019s control.\u201d\n\nAyoola said insurers had to organise workshops to look at insurance products that could be used to mitigate these climate risks, especially for farmers in the production value chain.\n\nHe said the capacity of insurers and service providers were being enhanced in order to know how best to make subsistence farmers understand ways to mitigate their risks through insurance.\n\nOn whether cost was a factor hindering the penetration of agro-insurance, Ayoola said, \u201cFor the Nigerian market, from my experience of close to three decades in this business of under-writing agricultural risks, the cost of agric insurance here is actually the cheapest anywhere in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is the cheapest anywhere in the world, as is applicable to the Nigerian farmers. So I believe the cost element is actually affordable.\u201d\n\nHe said the cost of agro-insurance had to be reduced in Nigeria because most small scale farmers considered this as an additional cost that they did without.\n\nThe Leadway Assurance official, however, noted that insurance was necessary because of the erratic climate in Nigeria, as he explained that in 2020 there were unusual dry spells and many farmers lost their crops.\n\nAyoola said, \u201cDry spells that we call August break which should not last more than 14 days but ended up lasting for about 52 days.\n\n\u201cSo if you are taking a look at the risks and uncertainties that the insurance company is insuring, vis-a-vis the price that the farmer is paying for the cost of insurance, it is certainly and very cheap.\u201d\n\nInsurers collaborate with farmers\n\nThe Head, Agric Insurance, AIICO Insurance Plc, Leonard Okereafor, stated that insurers had started collaborating with farmers based on the need to secure the country\u2019s food production through insurance.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur mandate is to reach smallholder farmers in Nigeria with respect to the insurance of their investments. But one thing you need to understand is the fact that it is easier to reach them through their cooperatives, aggregators and anchors.\n\n\u201cIt is more cost effective both for the insurance company and for the famers. That is not to say that if we have the opportunity to deal with them individually we wouldn\u2019t do that, but at the end of the day we look at the outcome.\u201d\n\nOkereafor stated that it had not been always easy for farmers to cope in terms of the payment of premium, apart from when they get assistance.\n\nHe noted that the collaboration between farmers and insurance firms was also geared towards addressing issues of mistrust which farmers had for insurance.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe issue of mistrust affects the whole insurance industry and we can\u2019t say because of that we will not do what is needful. What we do is to try to empower, educate, carry them along and let them know the importance of insurance.\n\n\u201cNow, the process of educating them is not a straightforward one. You will have to organise a lot of events and it is something that is ongoing and can\u2019t be achieved in a haste. No one company can do it all.\n\n\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t achieve this mandate, there is no how we will be able to make agriculture to develop in this country. But one key challenge is that the knowledge base is still low, especially on the part of the farmers.\u201d\n\nOkereafor stated that funding was also a factor limiting the ability of farmers to insure their produce, adding that there poor access to loans had been a challenge as well.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is important to note that about 98 per cent of the food we eat are produced by smallholder farmers in the crop value chain. And unfortunately, over 40 per cent of the rice we eat are imported.\u201d\n\nAsked to state the percentage of smallholder farmers who have access to insurance for their produce, Okereafor replied, \u201cWe have less than five per cent.\n\n\u201cThe target to increase this percentage is an ongoing thing and we are looking at getting about 10 million farmers within the next five years.\n\n\u201cIf we do that and we are able to build on it and other collaborators are equally involved in it, I think we can get there and food security will not be a far fetched expectation.\n\nHerdsmen attacks not covered by insurance, say farmers\n\nSpeaking on why many farmers were not insuring their commodities, the National President, Nigeria Cassava Growers Association, Segun Adewumi, said cassava farmers were not insuring their crops due to herdsmen menace on cassava.\n\nHe said insurance firms had also told cassava farmers that destruction caused by herdsmen could not be insured.\n\nAdewumi said, \u201cThere was this time when we insured our cassava and the herdsmen came and destroyed our crops. And when we reported they told us that what we experienced was malicious damage and that they don\u2019t insure malicious damage.\n\n\u201cSo we lost all to the herdsmen then. The greatest challenge we have in cassava cultivation is the activities of herdsmen. During the dry season, cassava is the only crop that stays wet and remains green.\n\n\u201cThis makes cassava a target of herdsmen and whenever they invade your farm you cannot have any claim from the insurance companies.\u201d\n\nThe cassava growers president, however, agreed that it was important for farmers to insure their produce, regardless of the challenge faced by those who cultivate cassava.\n\n\u201cHowever, beyond the challenge of cassava farmers with herdsmen, I think there is a need to insure our farm produce,\u201d he said.\n\nAdewumi added, \u201cAlso the insurance companies must be faithful, so that if there is any disaster they will take it up.\u201d\n\nHe further pleaded on insurance companies to consider insuring cassava crops whether those destroyed by weather conditions of herdsmen.\n\nAdewumi said, \u201cDuring the period that I earlier talked about, when herdsmen destroyed our cassava, we took the pictures and videos, invited the police, went to the Local Government chairman, got affidavits, among others.\n\n\u201cTo show enough evidence that herdsmen actually destroyed our cassava farms, but yet the insurance firms did not pay anything.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are being encouraged to insure our produce because of the loans from the Central Bank of Nigeria and other uses.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Ekiti State Chairman of the All Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigeria, Adebola Alagbada, explained that insurance only covered flood, fire and a few others but exclude cattle menace.\n\nHe lamented the destruction of farms by herdsmen\u2019s cattle among other security challenges.\n\nAlagbada said, \u201cGoing to farm is a serious problem. You face the challenge of being kidnapped by the bandits. Again, the challenges of herdsmen to farmers are enormous.\u201d\n\nHe noted that a major obstacle was the limited coverage of available insurance.\n\n\u201cWe want insurance to cover cattle menace. As it obtains now, it is not packaged into the insurance scheme. The insurance covers just flood and fire. It does not cover herders\u2019 attack which is the problem that we have in the farms,\u201d he said.\n\nAlagbada\u2019s position was corroborated by the state Chairman of the Maize Growers Processing Marketer Association of Nigeria, John Omoyajowo, who said the lack of insurance for cattle menace was also affecting farmers.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is nothing we can do about it. It is unfortunate the insurance we have does not cover cattle menace. When our farms were destroyed, they were referring us to insurance when they knew that cattle menace is not insured in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re speaking with insurance firms\u2019\n\nOn why only about five per cent of Nigerian farmers had their crops and agro-produce insured, the President, All Farmers Association of Nigeria, Kabir Ibrahim, described it as a cultural thing.\n\nHe, however, stated that many farmers had run out of business due to the failure of having their produce and crops insured, adding that AFAN had been speaking with insurance companies on how to address this concern.\n\nIbrahim said, \u201cIt is the culture in the country but if you ask the insurance firms today they know that we are in discussions with them because it is now important for us to insure our crops against the vagaries of whether and climate.\n\n\u201cRecently we had flooding. We cannot wait for government intervention in the form of compensation because it will not really cover much of what we lose.But if you insure you get a percentage payment of what was lost.\n\n\u201cSo we are talking with the insurance companies. And it is a very important thing that we are working on for we definitely have to insure our commodities. So many farmers have gone out of business because of flooding and things like that.\u201d\n\nHe said the association had been informed of the possibility of flooding in 2021 as predicted by Federal Government agencies.\n\nIbrahim said, \u201cWe are aware of the predictions on flooding and we know such predictions are being helpful to farmers because it enables us to plan very well and to avoid planting on flood prone plains.\n\n\u201cThis again speaks to why insurance is very important because even when you don\u2019t have flooding, some other things such insecurity, loss of goods in transit, etc, could lead to the loss of produce. However, we appreciate the flood predictions.\u201d\n\nIn March, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency advised the three tiers of government and citizens across the country to prepare against the impending devastating floods in 2021.\n\nDirector-General, NIHSA, Clement Nze, who gave the advice in Abuja, said this was because Nigeria was at the receiving end of disastrous floods among the nine countries of the River Niger Basin.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is still time for states/LGAs (Local Government Areas) and individuals to take necessary steps to avert or minimise the disastrous effects of flood in the year 2021.\n\n\u201cAs the country gradually steps into the 2021/2022 Hydrological Year in the River Niger Basin which covers nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Mall, Niger and Nigeria, it means that Nigeria is gradually inching towards the peak rainy season with its attendant flood incidents.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s geographical location downstream of all the countries in this Basin places it at the receiving end of disastrous floods and pollution from all the countries upstream.\u201d\n\nNze had also explained that the persistent flooding and flood disasters had become an annual event in Nigeria since 2012 when the country experienced its worst flood disaster in recent history.\n\nOfficials of the CBN and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed that the government had continued to encourage farmers to insure their crops and produce.\n\nGovt bringing insurers, farmers together\n\nThe Director, Policy and Regulation, National Insurance Commission, Leo Akah, said the Federal Government through NAIC had been working hard to ensure that more subsistence farmers insure their crops.\n\nHe stated that a few years ago, most insurance companies in Nigeria were not aware that they could offer insurance cover, apart from NAIC, which was the statutory institution put in place by the government to offer agric insurance.\n\n\u201cSo NAICOM (National Insurance Commission) in its wisdom realised that other operators can still offer one service or the other.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why you have insurance companies marketing products now to farmers to boost the productivity of these farmers and ensure food security for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn why many insurance firms were not fully into agric insurance, Akah explained that index insurance, which was obtainable in agric insurance, was slightly different from the conventional insurance policies.\n\nHe said, \u201cConventional insurance policies talk about indemnity. Now what is indemnity? It simply means that you\u2019ve suffered a loss and the insurer is to bring you back to that position you were before the loss happened.\n\n\u201cBut in this type of insurance, the effect of the adverse weather on your produce should warrant a compensation to the farmer. Now the compensation will still come whether you actually suffered loss or not. That is the striking difference here.\n\n\u201cAlso, the conventional insurance does not cover adverse weather conditions such as floods, hurricanes, etc.\n\n\u201cMind you, not everybody may have suffered losses from that excess rainfall, for instance, but you will still get some compensation.\u201d\n\nHe noted that with this kind of insurance in place, the farmers would have access to funds.\n\nThe NAIC official observed that most times, many smallholder farmers lacked collateral and access to funds.\n\n\u201cBut with this, they have some forms of backing in terms of credit, should anything happen to the farmer. Farmers don\u2019t have the required capital but with insurance behind them they can use it to access capital,\u201d Akah stated.\n\nHe further noted that the government could support could support farmers in accessing insurance through the provision of funds.\n\nAlso, the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers, Adaramola Tope, admonished farmers to approach the right players in the insurance sector, stressing that there was nothing that could not be insured.\n\nHe explained that the greater the risk, the higher the premium and urged farmers not to be deterred, as insurance firms would be willing to partner those who were ready to meet the requirements.\n\nTope said, \u201cThere is nothing that insurance firms cannot insure. The only thing is the apathy in that sector. The farmers themselves, the question we should ask them is what efforts have they made?\n\n\u201cThis is because we have insurance companies that are specialists in agric insurance, such as the Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Corporation, which is one of the companies licensed solely for agric insurance.\n\nHe explained that insurance involved risk taking, adding that the higher the risk, the greater the premium charged and encouraged farmers to be willing to make the required commitments.\n\n\u201cAnd to some of these farmers, the premium may be scary to them. And this is coming against the backdrop of concerns that what if we insure and the risk or danger that made us take insurance didn\u2019t happen?\u201d Tope stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cSo a lot of people are deluded by that to stay off insurance, not knowing that insurance sells peace of mind. So even if that peril did not happen, but then when you know that you have insurance in place it sort of helps you to be at peace.\n\n\u201cTherefore I don\u2019t believe that insurance firms do not want to insure farmers. Also, what is the nature of risk that they want to insure? These are some of the issues.\u201d\n\nThe council CEO further advised farmers to go through registered insurance brokers, adding that the broker would educate the farmers on how best to go about insuring that assets.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I will leave that to history.\n\nSo what is your biggest regret?\n\n(Laughs)\u2026 I think God has made everything in my life positive and possible. When I look at my balance sheet, I have no regret whatsoever. Like I said earlier, it has been too good and too graceful and to a large extent too successful in all aspects. I can confess to you that Oba Sikiru Adetona, the Awujale of Ijebuland, reminds me every day that I should take every day as a day of thanksgiving. He tells me that every aspect of my life, my youth, my schooldays, my middle age, my old age, have all been very glorious. We talk every day and he keeps reminding me that I should be doing thanksgiving every day because there are not many people of my age that are celebrated by their professional colleagues as I am being celebrated. He is a father in a million and he keeps reminding me every day that I should be doing thanksgiving to God.\n\nHow do you unwind at your age?\n\nIn my younger days, I and the likes of Ike Nwachukwu and Babangida used to paint Lagos not just red but rainbow. I have seen it all at 82. So, what do I want to do now? Go to disco? No. That is why I don\u2019t do elaborate birthday celebrations. I now spend time with my grandchildren. I see birthdays as a day of serious reflection and thanksgiving. I am not a club person. I don\u2019t drink or smoke. I relate with friends occasionally. Sam Amuka and I have had everything. There is nothing I want to do that I have not done.\n\nWill you say abstaining from cigarettes and alcohol contributed to your longevity?\n\nOne of my former classmates, who is also my doctor, used to tell me that somehow, my not joining my classmates in those days in drinking and smoking probably must have contributed to my good health. I didn\u2019t join them in smoking and drinking but one thing I can say is that everything I have done in life has been in moderation. Secondly, I try to avoid being envious of people or judging people. I believe in myself and love to have peace of mind. I hate to bear grudges or stay angry overnight. I try to forget bad things that happen in life\n\nAs an elder statesman, what do you think Nigeria can do to address the rising demands for secession in various parts of the country 51 years after the civil war ended?\n\nI will not use the word secession. I think self-determination and requests for self esteem, agitations for fairness and justice are not something to be ashamed of. Even in advanced countries like in the United Kingdom where I am at the moment, the Scots are still agitating for their own country. The UK is not one country. There are different \u2018tribes\u2019. So, what is the offence in that? And our founding fathers at different times, displayed their frustrations about Nigeria. So, when the youth of today are expressing their frustration, what we should do is to look at the root cause of the frustration. When people graduate from university, they have no job. When I was young, even with an ordinary secondary school certificate, a job was waiting for you. As soon as I got our WASSCE result, a job was waiting for me at the Lagos City Council. I remember in my days, there were not too many universities. At the University College, Ibadan, which was a college of the University of London, the graduates in those days could easily be identified with their briefcases. As soon as they came out with their briefcases, jobs would be waiting for them along with a car. But today, even people with PhDs, doctors, lawyers, are now event planners. Under such a situation, you don\u2019t expect the young ones not to feel frustrated.\n\nAccording to research by Dr Jibrin Ibrahim, even the Sardauna of Sokoto at some point wanted to opt out of Nigeria. His reason was that he could not cede authority to the British only for us who are in the South to become the overlords in the North. At a point, even Papa Awolowo, based on research by Dr. Jibrin Ibrahim, asked during the constitutional conference that we should insert a clause for any region that doesn\u2019t feel happy to secede. At some point, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe was frustrated; he too wanted secession like Michael Okpara. Even the symbol of Nigerian unity, General Yakubu Gowon, in his first major speech as head of state, said the base of Nigeria\u2019s unity was no longer in existence.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think we should criminalise or demonise those who are talking of self-esteem, those who are asking for justice and fairness. Rather, we should look at the root cause and not let the rabble-rousers hijack the feelings of the younger ones.\n\nWhat do you see to the rising insecurity?\n\nIt is something that bothers me. In the South, the farmers cannot go to farm. I can give you my own example. I do cassava farming in Abeokuta. People that used to come to help us on our farms are no longer coming. We are now farming at 15 per cent capacity. So, you can imagine the amount of yields that we have lost. So, the farmers in the South don\u2019t go to farm because of insecurity and this will lead to food insecurity. The whole of the North has been taken back by 50 years because the educational system has been totally destroyed. No parent will send his child to a boarding school in the North and the boarding school system is the best for the North. So, you can imagine this incessant kidnapping of children and the destructive effect on our system. The northerners are the biggest victims and we should be concerned about the kind of society we will have in the next 10 to 15 years. As a parent it is difficult to think of children in captivity.\n\nRecently, the 17 southern governors collectively stated that the next President must come from the South, a position which you have canvassed in the past. However, some northern groups have insisted on competence ahead of zoning. What\u2019s your view on this?\n\nIn a democracy, we allow different opinions but the fragile situation in Nigeria should teach us that not one section can continue to ride roughshod on the other. I believe that the Presidency for now, for the survival of Nigeria, for the continuation of this country, should rotate between North and South. If you talk of competence, is competence limited to a particular ethnic group or sub-ethnic group? During the APC merger, we decided that the President of the party would come from the North, the chairman would be from the South and after eight years, the Presidency would return to the South. In every region we have millions of people who are competent. So, the idea that merit and competence should be ahead of zoning\u2026 what standard is being used to measure competence? I am in total support of the southern governors. We started the southern governors\u2019 forum during our time. The northern governors have been meeting for ages and we didn\u2019t complain in the South. So, what is wrong with the southern governors meeting and expressing the views of those who elected them?\n\nWhen we were forming the APC, we agreed that the Presidency would be given to the North and we the progressives in the South-West agreed. The second point of negotiation was the devolution of power, true federalism. So, some who were not there cannot tell us to stop that. I stand on the fact that we should rotate the Presidency between the North and South of the party.\n\nBut the APC has no written constitution on zoning and this agreement of North and South rotation was never really put into writing.\n\nI was the chairman of the constitution drafting committee of the APC. We drafted the constitution and the reason we didn\u2019t put it into writing is that it could be challenged in court and anything in writing could be seen as going against the fundamental right in the constitution which guarantees the right to aspire to any office in the country. But for the purpose of the survival of the country, we agreed to this but we cannot put it into writing. It cannot be enforced in court but it is an unwritten understanding and for the sake of the continuity of Nigeria, the Presidency should come from the South.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Nigeria, ECOWAS sign MoU on implementing Early Warning mechanism, centre\n\nVice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo\n\nSince security threats confronting Nigeria and the rest of West Africa are becoming more violent, asymmetric, cross-border by nature, and spreading faster than before, the need for an effective sub-regional collaboration on early warning systems has become a necessity, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo stated this on Tuesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, during a signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding between Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on the implementation of an Early Warning mechanism and for the establishment of a National Early Warning and Response Centre in the country.\n\nThe Strategic Framework for the establishment of National Early Warning and Response mechanisms was adopted by the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government at the 45th ordinary session which held in Accra, Ghana in July, 2014.\n\nAccording to the Framework, the establishment of the early warning system is to provide real-time information on events or other incidents likely to affect social peace and security in the West African region. It also seeks to provide information on the occurrence of social and political events and climate change.\n\nA major objective of a national Coordination Centre for the early warning mechanism is to strengthen the ECOWAS strategy for information sharing among Member States, so as to avert or reduce threats.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a better time for this process (than now) which will lead to full implementation of the Early Warning and Response System. We are at a time nationally, and sub-regionally, where the security threats that confront us are becoming more violent, they are asymmetric, spread faster than before, and they are cross border in their nature.\n\n\u201cThere is no question at all that this is a moment when we really should be looking at how to collaborate in real-time and in increasingly more imaginative ways in sharing information, and also in sharing competence in order to confront our security challenges.\u201d\n\nCommending the sub-regional body for its foresight in the design of the regional warning system, the VP said \u201cthe clear expansion of the ECOWAS early warning and response network to include terrorism indicators is a very important thing.\n\n\u201cI think this has helped a great deal in not only focusing on terrorism, which is, today, possibly the most lethal threat that we face, but also in giving us an opportunity as a sub-region to bring the very best possible ideas and to be able to check these threats as quickly and as efficiently as possible.\u201d\n\nWhile assuring partners of the Buhari administration\u2019s commitment to the programme, Osinbajo said \u201cthe administration will ensure that the early warning and response system is implemented and we look forward to working with you \u2013 ECOWAS -in ensuring that it is fully implemented.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Amb. Zubairu Dada, said the signing of the MoU was a consolidation of discussions held at different levels by ECOWAS leaders to find ways of containing threats to security in the sub-region.\n\nAlso in his remarks, the President of the ECOWAS Commission, Jean-Claude Kassi Brou, said the signing of the MoU reiterates Nigeria\u2019s commitment to promoting peace and security in West Africa.\n\nHe recalled that the regional early warning mechanism was set up by the ECOWAS 1999 protocol relating to the mechanism for conflict prevention, management, resolution, peacekeeping and security, and to support the region in anticipating, mitigating and responding to challenges of human security.\n\n\u201cIn order to support member states in strengthening their capacity in preventing human security challenges, the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government in 2014 signed a supplementary Act, adopting the policy framework on the establishment of national early warnings, and rapid response mechanism,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile commending Osinbajo\u2019s leadership and support, Brou appealed to Nigeria to sign an Executive Order to give legal backing to the planned National Centre for Early Warning and Response System.\n\nSenior government officials present at the ceremony included the Ministers of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd.); Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola; Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr Zainab Ahmed; Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Farouq; Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen; and National Security Adviser, Maj.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nGovernors of the 36 states of the federation on the platform of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), have approved a common template for the implementation of the Memorandum of Action\n\nsigned with the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASUN) on the implementation of financial autonomy for the State legislature and judiciary.\n\nIn a communique issued at the end of the Forum\u2019s meeting and signed by NGF\u2019s Chairman and Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, the Forum said the\n\ntemplate was developed following a meeting of the State Attorneys General and Commissioners of\n\nFinance which held on the 25th of June 2021 at the directive of the Forum.\n\nRecall that President Muhammadu Buhari, had in May 2020, signed into law an Executive Order 10 to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary across the 36 states of the country.\n\nThe order also mandates the accountant-general of the federation to deduct from source amount due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation to each state for states that refuse to grant such autonomy.\n\nThe union had embarked on a nationwide strike in April to protest the non-implementation of the financial autonomy of the nation\u2019s judiciary.\n\nThe union directed all its members across the federation to shut down all courts after the expiration of the 21-day ultimatum earlier given over the failure of the government to implement the financial autonomy of the judiciary.\n\nThe strike was eventually called off 64 days later following a meeting between officials of the union and the National Judicial Council (NJC) led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad.\n\nOn the The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), the Forum is in full support of the unbundling and commercialization of the Nigeria National Petroleum\n\nCorporation (NNPC) but concerned with the proposed ownership structure of the NNPC which places ownership on the Federal Government.\n\nThe NGF recommended that given that the corporation is owned by the three tiers of government, the new incorporated entity (NNPC Limited) should be owned by a vehicle that holds the interest of the three tiers of government \u2013 for now, the institution that is positioned to carry out this mandate is the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\n\u201cThis amendment as well as the proposed 3% share of oil revenue to host communities and 30% share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins will be responded to at relevant channels including the National Assembly and the National Economic Council (NEC).\n\nOn the Nigerian Postal Service Bill, 2021 and Stamp Duties Collection, the Forum expressed concern with certain proposed amendments to the Principal Stamp Duties Act by the Nigerian Senate which seeks to remove the powers to administer and collect stamp duties from the\n\nrelevant tax authorities (Federal Inland Revenue Service or State Internal Revenue Service, depending on the nature of the transaction) to the Nigeria Postal Service. The provisions of Section 163 of the 1999\n\nConstitution requires that Stamp Duties on transactions between a company and an individual should be paid to the FIRS and returned to the State of derivation. The Forum resolved to engage with the National Assembly on the matter.\n\nOn the Sale of Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) Assets, the NGF said it will take a position on the planned privatization of assets of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) which were listed by the Bureau for Public Enterprise (BPE) without due consultation\n\nwith State governments who are shareholders of the company. NDPHC is incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act as a private limited liability company with shareholding fully subscribed to by the Federal, State and Local Governments with a mandate to manage National Integrated Power\n\nProjects (NIPP) in the country.\n\nOn the launch of the NGF Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative, the Forum put its weight behind the launch of its Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative (PISI) set up to tackle insecurity, conflicts and violence in the country.\n\nIt said the launch of PISI which took place on 8th July 2021 heralded an important milestone for NGF as it seeks to build a more inclusive and collaborative\n\nplatform to drive an urgent country-wide response to security challenges in the country.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) and the Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) have applauded the rejection of presidential aide, Lauretta Onochie, as national commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by the Senate.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said the rejection is a victory for democracy and triumph of the people over attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to corrupt INEC ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nThe nomination of Onochie by the Presidency was trailed by controversy, which reached a climax, yesterday, as the Senate rejected the nomination.\n\nThe Senate said its action was based on abuse of Federal Character principle, which states that every part of the country must be represented.\n\nDelta State where Onochie hails from has a serving national commissioner in INEC.\n\nThe Senate also stepped down confirmation of Professor Sani Muhammad Adam as a national commissioner, until further notice over some unresolved issues.\n\nThe PDP said the rejection of Onochie has saved the country from a serious crisis and salvaged INEC and the entire Nigerian electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe party asserts that Onochie\u2019s vexatious nomination, in total affront to paragraph 14 of the 3rd schedule of the 1999 Constitution was a very dangerous machination by the Buhari-led APC Presidency against our electoral process, in the attempt to subvert the will of the people in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe APC, in spite of its shenanigans, is aware that it will have difficulties winning election at any level in a free, fair and credible election and as such it is determined to rig every process ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cOur party, therefore, commends Nigerians including civil society organisations, the media as well as other political parties, for joining forces with the PDP in fighting for the sanctity of our electoral process by resisting Onochie\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cThe stiff resistance displayed by Nigerians across board, in repelling this vicious attempt to hijack and pollute the electoral commission, underscores their collective and unwavering determination to resist and kick out the APC in 2023, despite its shenanigans,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nThe CTA, in a statement by its Executive Director, Faith Nwadishi, said Onochie\u2019s rejection would augur well for Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cMadam Onochie\u2019s presence in INEC would have in great measures impinged on the integrity of the Electoral Management Board and put to question the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Senate has done the needful by listening to the voice of the people even though pressured by Nigerians to be accountable to the people and represent the interest of the people.\n\n\u201cCTA calls on CSOs and Nigerians to still be vigilant and look forward to the National Assembly passing an Electoral Bill that will have electronic transmission of results by INEC and addresses all other issues raised by Nigerians. Citizen\u2019s power keeps hope alive for our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn its reaction, NYCN said the rejection is a victory for democracy and confirmation of the independence of the National Assembly.\n\nThe group, through its president, Isah Abubakar, cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advisers against such controversial nominations to avoid a repeat of what could be described as a coup against the Nigeria Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe admonish the leaders of the National Assembly to continue to put Nigeria\u2019s democracy first above party/individual sentiments,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe N15 trillion Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo), created by the federal government to bridge the nation\u2019s huge infrastructure gap is to take off in the third quarter of the year, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday at an investors\u2019 webinar designed to showcase the investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s privatisation and economic reforms programmes, organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in collaboration with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo also said at the event that although the government\u2019s economic reforms had paid off in telecommunications, pension and maritime sectors, the current administration was making efforts to address the challenges in the power sector privatisation.\n\nInvestors in the N15 trillion InfraCo include the CBN, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Africa Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nIn his goodwill message at the webinar, Emefiele said the federal government had approved KPMG as the financial adviser to InfraCo, adding that the firm is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to attain meaningful growth, there must be huge investments in key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure such as rail and power, among others.\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo has generated huge interest in deploying private capital to for infrastructure, adding that the approval of the vice president has been secured to appoint KPMG as transaction advisers.\n\nEmefiele stated that over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in the global crude oil market had created negatively affected not only the global economy but also the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor Nigeria, we witnessed a drop in foreign exchange earnings, government revenues along with supply chain disruptions which ultimately led to the economy falling into a recession during the third quarter of 2020. Significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities in key sectors of our economy such as in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors eventually helped and led to the rebound of growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe sustenance of these measures have also helped to support growth of 0.51 per cent during the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, we consider this growth as fragile and therefore seek the support of those of us here at this webinar to continue to work with us to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that in June 2021, investments in the Importers and Exporters (I&E) window stood at over N3 trillion at an average rate of N412 to the dollar, adding that this meant that on an average working day of 20 working days, close to $150 million was posted in that market.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria had huge gas investment potential waiting to be exploited.\n\nShe stated that despite the numerous challenges confronting the country, it still remains the premium investment destination in Africa.\n\nAhmed said the COVID-19 pandemic had provided greater need for the federal government to forge a more robust partnership with the private sector.\n\nIn his keynote address, Osinbajo said the investors\u2019 webinar was organised to showcase investment opportunities arising from Nigerians economic reforms and privatisation activities.\n\nHe said: \u201d I think that many who have observed the current Nigerian government would agree with me that an article of faith for this government is the importance of mobilising private capital and participation for improving efficiency and driving economic growth and this really explains why we have this collaboration today between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (which you know is in charge of our sectoral reform programme) with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) to host this seminar as an important platform drawing attention to investment opportunities to both our local and foreign friends and collaborators.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, privatising utilities of the size of the former PHCN simply calls for deeper intentional consideration of the right models and the right type of investors and also looking at funding for these investors over an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the challenges that we have seen, but I think that it\u2019s an excellent lesson and there is so much that we are learning in approaching privatisation, especially our utilities, going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome, address, the BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, said the BPE had listed over 36 assets for sale and giving them out to concessionaires under its 2021 work plan.\n\nHe stated that about N500 billion is expected to be contributed into the federal government coffers from the privatisation proceeds this year.\n\nAccording to him, 234 public assets have been sold in the last 32 years while N1 trillion was generated by the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says 542,576 Nigerians have completed online voter registration\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday expressed the determination of the commission to deepen democracy through the use of technology.\n\nHe also put the number of Nigerians who have completed online voters\u2019 pre-registration at 542,576.\n\nYakubu, at a meeting yesterday in Abuja with the resident electoral commissioners, said: \u201cI would like to reassure Nigerians that the commission will continue to spare no effort in deepening the use of technology to ensure electoral transparency and credibility.\u201d\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the clamour for the inclusion of electronic transmission of election results in the 2010 Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, amidst efforts by the leadership of the National Assembly to delete the provision from the bill.\n\nYakubu said the voters\u2019 register remained at the heart of any credible election.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are working hard to ensure that just as we had a smooth take-off of the online pre-registration, the commencement of the physical registration will similarly be hitch-free.\u201d\n\nHe said the first quarter of the physical registration would commence between June 28 and September 30, while the second quarter of the exercise will start October 4 to December 30.\n\nAlso, the third quarter of the physical registration will start from January 3, 2022, to April 1, 2022, and the fourth quarter will kick off on April 11 to June 30, 2022.\n\nGiving update of the exercise, Yakubu said two weeks since the exercise began, a total of 542,576 Nigerians have completed the online pre-registration.\n\nAccording to him, out of this figure, 456,909 are fresh registrants while 85,667 have applied for voter transfer, replacement of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and update of voter information record among others.\n\nHe added that the commission is able to provide Nigerians with information on the distribution of registrants across the states and by age, occupation, gender and disability.\n\n\u201cOut of 542,576 online registrants so far, 356,777 (or 66 per cent) are young people between the ages of 18 and 34 years.\n\n\u201cThis is followed by 134,719 middle-aged registrants who fall between 35 and 49 years. The third category is elderly persons aged between 50 and 69 years of which 44,896 Nigerians have registered. Interestingly, some 6,184 senior citizens (aged 70 years and above) have taken advantage of the new online opportunity to register,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the occupational distribution of registrants, the INEC chairman said: \u201c156,446 are students; 38,217 artisans; 24,421 farmers and fishermen; 150,145 businessmen and traders; 35,831 employed as civil and public servants and 8,334 housewives.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 129,182 registrants did not specify their occupations. On gender, 321,781 are males while 220,795 are females. In our effort to serve all Nigerians better, the commission has requested registrants to indicate their disability (if any).\u201d\n\nHe explained that the essence of this will enable INEC to efficiently deploy assistive voting devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for persons with special needs at polling units on election day.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have data for 6,558 registrants who have clearly indicated their type of disability.\u201d\n\nYakubu said a detailed information, including state and occupational distribution, had been uploaded on the commission\u2019s website and social media platforms, while the commission shall also continue to provide the weekly updates throughout the duration of the CVR exercise.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is aware that not all Nigerians have access to computers, smart phones or internet connectivity to register online.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly assured every eligible registrant that there will also be an opportunity for physical or in-person registration at designated centres. Even the online registrants will have to complete their registration physically at those centres.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to activate some 2,673 centres to which we intend to deploy 5,346 officials for in-person registration,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By John Shiklam\n\nA total of 222 people have been killed while 774 others have been kidnapped by bandits in Kaduna state in the past three months.\n\nThis was contained in the second quarter security report, presented to Governor Nasir El-Rufai by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan on Tuesday at the Government House Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the report covers the period between April 1 to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe report showed a slide reduction in the number of deaths and the number of people abducted.\n\nIn the first quarter report, present in April, a total of 323 persons were killed while 949 others were kidnapped by bandits across Kaduna State.\n\nAruwan also disclosed that a total of 8,553 heads of cattle were rustled in the period under review with most stolen from the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, which accounted for around\n\n5,715 stolen cattle.\n\nAruwan said the 222 deaths were caused by banditry attacks, communal clashes and reprisals across the state.\n\nAccording to him, 159 of the deaths, were recorded in Kaduna Central Senatorial District while Southern Kaduna Senatorial District and Northern Senatorial District recorded 54 and nine deaths respectively.\n\nThe commissioner said of the 774 people kidnapped, Kaduna Central Senatorial\n\nDistrict topped the list with 555 people abducted.\n\nBirnin Gwari, Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa and Igabi LGAs, where there are rampant cases of killings and kidnappings are in the Kaduna Central senatorial zone.\n\nHe said, \u201cSouthern Kaduna Senatorial District recorded 164 kidnapped persons, with Kachia LGA reporting the highest number of 111.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Senatorial District recorded 55 kidnapped persons, with 37 of these from Zaria LGA.\n\n\u201cIn total, 239 women, and 32 minors were kidnapped in the second quarter across the state\u201d.\n\nThe commissioner also disclosed that 20 persons were reported to have been raped across the state during the period, adding that a total of 266 were injured as a result of banditry, violent attacks, reprisals and communal clashes.\n\nAruwan also raised the alarm over looming food insecurity, threat to education and attack on health facilities in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cBanditry has hampered farming activities in the frontline areas of the state.\n\n\u201cBandits attack and abduct farmers working on or on their way to their fields. Several farmers have similarly been killed.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits have begun to extract protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\n\u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether.\n\n\u201cThis has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large.\u201d\n\nHe said the most affected communities are in the frontline Local Government\n\nAreas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia,\n\nKagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga.\u201d\n\nAruwan said attacks on some schools and mass abduction of students portends dire consequences for education in the state.\n\nHe said hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat by armed bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBanditry has led to the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. \u201cThe activities of bandits in these areas have dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and disrupted the\n\noperation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\n\n\u201cBesides the rustling of cattle, the previously highlighted targeting of farmers by armed bandits has generally eroded the economic viability of rural communities, in addition to precipitating a food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis has translated to losses running into billions of naira from the rural economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the State government\u2019s strategies to address the security challenges were being sustained.\n\nThe commissioner decried the politicization of insecurity saying \u201cpolitical mappings and strategies are now frequently being built around the unfortunate scenarios of insecurity, while real people and real communities suffer\n\ndevastation at the hands of sheer criminals.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cEthnic and religious narratives are also being built around banditry, to the further complication of security management.\n\n\u201cToo often, attacks by bandits are portrayed to the public by some quarters as ethnically or religiously motivated.\n\nSuch groups manipulate religious, ethnic and political sensitivities for their own advantage, simply to advance a cause inimical to peace and stability of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks after receiving the reports, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said an unconventional approach is required to enable the state government protect its citizens.\n\nA Government House statement issued after the presentation of the report, quoted the governor as\n\ncalling on the federal government to empower the state government to make up for the manpower deficit in the security sector.\n\n\u201cThe state government must be empowered and supported by the federal government to make up the manpower deficit in the security sector\u201d, the statement quoted the governor.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccitizens who have been affected by crime and insecurity are not interested in the distinctions between the federal and state governments in terms of their powers over security.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a state government, we have also seen at close quarters how the federal security agencies are limited by manpower deficits.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019an unconventional approach is required to enable us better to protect our communities and we are engaging with the federal government and the leadership of the security agencies on this.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

(CRF), being 25 percent of its internally generated revenue (IGR) contravened the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\nIt added that the failure to remit capitalised interest to the CRF, \u201ctotalling\u201d N99.71 million, between 2013 and 2014 contravened Rule 236 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nIn May 2021, the senate committee on finance had invited heads of 60 government-owned firms, including the ports authority, to explain the failure to remit various funds running into about N3 trillion to the federal government\u2019s account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement signed by Ezrel Tabiowo, special assistant (press) to the senate president, on Wednesday, the upper chamber mandated the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate the accounting officer under Rule 3112 (I and II) of the Financial Regulations.\n\nThe senate demanded that the director-general who authorised the disbursement of contingency provision on the contract for the

          "text": "A High Court in Kenya has ordered Safaricom to pay a blind man KSh6 million ($56,000) for failing to hire him after he had gone through the entire recruitment process.\n\nWilson Macharia sued the network operator to seek compensation because his rights were violated, BusinessDaily reported. He told Justice James Makau that Safaricom declined to employ him as a customer care executive on grounds that it did not have specialised software to help him with his work.\n\nMacharia said he responded to an advert by Safaricom in August 2016 for a customer experience executive position, which invited qualified Kenyans irrespective of \u201crace, colour, religion, gender, tribal origin, disability or age\u201d.\n\nAlong with other persons living with disabilities, Macharia was shortlisted for the job, went through the oral interview and medical test, after which he was invited to sign the contract in July 2017. However, Safaricom said the invite was erroneous.\n\nIn its defense, the telecoms firm denied discriminating against the plaintiff and argued that it allowed Macharia to be interviewed for the job but that it lacked specialised software that would enable him to work.\n\nThe judge ruled that the company violated Macharia\u2019s rights and failed to treat him with dignity as it should have informed him earlier that the software was unavailable instead of making him go through the recruitment process only to later claim the letter was sent erroneously.\n\n\u201cI find that the Respondent\u2019s excuse to be an afterthought that was introduced late to the detriment of the Petitioner. The Respondent knew right from the beginning that the Petitioner\u2019s work called for software, yet they took him through all recruitment steps,\u201d Justice Makau ruled.\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities around the world.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that there are over 650 million people around the world who live with disabilities; 98% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school and the literacy rate for adults with disabilities is as low as 3%.\n\nIn addition, millions of people with disabilities want to get jobs but can\u2019t get hired. Even in developed economies, they struggle to find employment.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks.

          "title": "Central bank digital currencies differ from crypto. Here\u2019s how they work",
          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

Like other private organisations, tech companies have to answer to the constituted authorities wherever they operate.\n\nThe duty is arguably more pressing and sensitive if the company operates in the financial services industry, where consumer protection and fraud prevention are government priorities.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s payments processing business is live in 33 African countries.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify.

          "title": "Spazio Ideale designs iconic workspaces for tech companies like Paystack, uLesson, others",
          "text": "Several studies have confirmed the correlation between how a space looks and how a person lives or works. With changes in how we view our environment, there is now an increasing demand to put much thought into space designs. But this has not always been the case.\n\nPitching space designs, in Africa for instance, is more commonplace today than it was a decade ago, with more people now interested in how their spaces look. Interestingly, we are talking about a $115 billion industry projected to hit $121 billion by the end of 2021. And it gets more exciting with the various options available with innovation.\n\nThe acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\n\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers. She studied computer science for her first degree, with a masters in interior design coming after as she followed her love for designing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nIn what started as a passion, she soon decided to turn interior designing into a business. Her entrepreneurship journey started by chance.\n\nThe rise of Spazio Ideale\n\nAfter her postgraduate studies in Italy in 2014 and a stint in Ghana, she couldn\u2019t find any suitable design company to join when she returned to Nigeria. They all didn\u2019t fit into the designs she liked, among other concerns. So she started telling people about what she does.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you go to a design school, you have to create a design portfolio of your work. And when I got back, I distributed it to a few people to see. They got to see what I love to do and how I love to create.\u201d\n\nAnd she eventually convinced some of the people in her circle to patronise her.\n\nIn June 2015, she did her first project, a living space, for a friend. The startup has since grown in its scope of coverage and is currently more of a commercial space design company.\n\nProud of the progress the company has made so far, Bamgbelu reveals that it has done more than 50 projects cutting across residential, commercial, hospitality, and school facilities.\n\nHowever, most of them are in commercial spaces \u2014 over 30 clients \u2014 particularly the tech space. With most projects gotten from referrals, the startup touts itself as the first in the tech space, boasting of designing office spaces for popular startups in Nigeria.\n\nNotable mentions include Kuda Bank, Softcom, Heritage Bank, Paystack, Reliance HMO, uLesson, Techpoint Africa, and Max.ng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior photos of ISN Medicals at Ilupeju, Lagos. Designed by Spazio Ideale. Source: Supplied\n\nBamgbelu relives with fondness how the team came up with Paystack\u2019s iconic workspace design.\n\n\u201cIn our initial conversation with Paystack, we tried to understand how they are and what they do, and we realised that they have a friendly organisation, although small then, but they were like a family and a fun environment to work in. And we designed the space to reflect this.\u201d\n\nA customer-centric approach\n\nBetween initial contact to delivery, there are five steps the team goes through to satisfy a client \u2014 this is called the Spazio Way. First, a 60-minute meeting, then a conceptual design, detail, execution, and after-sales care.\n\nHowever, the delivery time depends on the scope of the project.\n\nAlthough Bamgbelu personally handled the startup\u2019s first set of projects, the founder\u2019s current responsibility is to provide overall creative direction from design to execution.\n\nThis is easy because she has a reliable team of 14 highly skilled individuals consisting of interior designers, architects, civil engineers, and building technologists. This fills her with confidence as they all work together to deliver on every project.\n\nSpazio Ideale team. Source: Supplied\n\nThe startup also engages partners like muralists, furniture makers, and plumbers, among others. In essence, Spazio Ideale\u2019s work can sometimes require completely changing the entire structure of a space, from ceiling to floor.\n\nBamgbelu highlights how the team comes up with the design for any project.\n\n\u201cIt depends on a few things; we design based on what the client is trying to achieve. The first thing we ask is, why aren\u2019t you doing this yourself? Why do you need an interior designer to do it for you? That\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201d\n\nBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s in trying to save cost because they don\u2019t know where to get the things they want. Others are looking for expertise because they have this idea in mind but don\u2019t know how to go about it. Some others are looking to improve employee experience or brand association.\n\n\u201cSo, every design is usually different, although they might have the same elements. Sometimes, it depends on the company\u2019s culture \u2014 fun or reserved, or the functional and aesthetic needs of the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe founder believes that the most challenging project in the past six months was creating uLesson\u2019s Abuja office with less than two months given for the design and implementation.\n\n\u201cWe did deliver it within two months. So, it was challenging to make sure that happened because of the size of the project, which is 1,000 square metres, and there were so many unique pieces.\u201d\n\nCost depends on a client\u2019s budget; however, quality is not compromised in the process. Bamgbelu is often encouraged because customers are satisfied that the projects are completed without them needing to step in after the initial discussions. And this makes the startup have repeat clients seeking a redesign or who\u2019ve either moved offices or opened new ones.\n\nIf anything, this has helped the company grow. Before 2019, the startup experienced a 50-70% revenue growth. Between 2019 and 2020, the revenue increased by 150% while working towards an equally successful 2021.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nIn a space with other interior designing businesses like Space Finish, the founder believes Spazio Ideale stands out as it doesn\u2019t set out just to make a space look good.\n\nBesides excellent execution, there is conceptualising and designing. The team comes up with unique designs that blend perfectly into the client\u2019s company structure and aid proper communication and interaction while creating an unforgettable impression on visitors.\n\nTo explain Spazio Ideale\u2019s competitive edge, Bamgbelu speaks of how Spazio Ideale got the job to design Paystack\u2019s first office in 2016, a year after the payments company launched in 2015.\n\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.\n\n\u201cWhat you usually expect in a reception is to see the company logo, lights, probably made of acrylic or glass. Understanding Paystack\u2019s culture, we saw that these guys aren\u2019t rigid. So, their first point of contact, as people enter into the reception, should reflect them. And that is why we came up with that \u2018Welcome\u2019 wall where we wrote welcome in different languages.\u201d\n\nPaystack \u2018Welcome Wall\u2019. Designed by Spazio Ideale\n\nThis decision would create an unforgettable story in Paystack\u2019s history and influence the decision to invite Spazio Ideale to design its second office.\n\nBamgbelu relates how the wall made some foreigners who visited the office see them as welcoming and heartwarming people because they felt at home after seeing \u2018Welcome\u2019 in their languages.\n\nDespite similar success stories, the startup has had its challenges, many of which are peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nBamgbelu looks forward to a time when electricity and Internet, inflation, and talent development will no longer be a clog in the wheel of creative businesses seeking to remain competitive.\n\nOther problems that come with playing in the creative industry \u201cinclude access to good quality partners that help us achieve our projects. For example, it\u2019s difficult to access very good artisans and workmen. And because we pride ourselves on excellence, we sometimes have to redo things until they are right. But regardless of all these, we\u2019re clear on what we want to deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\nChanging seasons and what the future\u2019s like\n\nWhen campaigns for social distancing and working from home (WFH) became pronounced at the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 \u2014 with the idea of having a physical office often debated \u2014 Spazio Ideale had a relatively good run, although it lost a few clients.\n\nBamgbelu reiterated how the startup experienced a 150% revenue growth. One wonders what was there to do during a lockdown and office closures.\n\n\u201cAll the time we were working from home, we had designs to churn out. And the design phase takes time,\u201d she clarifies.\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nEssentially, interior designing is a highly creative business that is yet to be fully appreciated in this part of the world because of how little people know about its influence on living and working.\n\nBamgbelu explains it this way.\n\n\u201cOrganisations provide tools, and people tend to have tools that make them productive. The space where people work is a tool to make sure the organisation achieves its objectives. So, if the staff is happy with the space, it helps them make profit.\u201d\n\nHence, she recommends educating people and organisations to see its importance. Still, only interested people approach interior designers for consultation or design and execution.\n\nBamgbelu states that the concept of remote work does not threaten the growth of the business, especially in Nigeria, pointing out that the particular challenges associated with WFH \u2014 electricity and Internet \u2014 would only encourage companies to run a hybrid model.\n\nInterestingly, Spazio Ideale\u2019s client base is still made up of mostly commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cThe truth is organisations want to get their spaces up and running. Everybody is thinking past COVID-19. Yes, there\u2019s the work from home strategy, which we recommend. But we believe the office is not going away,\u201d she submits.\n\nThe startup plans to reach more African and international markets by Q4 2021. Even though there\u2019ve been projects from foreign organisations with offices in Nigeria, getting jobs from these companies for their offices outside Nigeria would be a major step forward.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",

Source: Supplied.\n\nThe story: Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, has announced Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. The University of Ibadan alumnus brings 18 years of experience in law, regulatory affairs, and government relations.\n\nBefore his appointment, he was the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations at IHS Towers. He has also held key leadership roles at MTN and Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this important? The fintech space where Flutterwave operates is one of the most regulated sectors of Nigeria\u2019s tech industry. In the past, government policies have affected their operations, and Falade\u2019s appointment would go a long way to strengthen the relationship between the startup and the government.\n\nSetting the pace? With the Nigerian government frequently springing policy surprises on startups, we could see similar appointments to anticipate them and engage proactively with the government.\n\nFor more context: Flutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nVerifyMe launches VeriFind\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO, VerifyMe. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to fill out a form when opening a bank account, then you\u2019ve provided your home address. Like me, you may have wondered why they bothered since they probably never verified the address.\n\nWell, VerifyMe Nigeria, an identity verification startup, wants to change that with its geotagging solution, VeriFind. Backed by a network of 13,000 agents across the country, the product is also Anti-Money Laundering Compliant.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder and CEO of VerifyMe, \u201cMany organisations see the address verification component of KYC as a chore and the 24 to 48 hour wait period for traditional processing is simply unsuitable to the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced businesses.\u201d\n\nVeriFind was not the only product that VerifyMe unveiled as they also revealed a Nigerian Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN) verification service and a Facial Liveness Tool.\n\nWith the Facial Liveness Tool, the startup will draw on national databases such as the National Identification Number and driver\u2019s license to authenticate identities. At the same time, the NUBAN verification service will allow for the verification of financial transactions by cross-referencing datasets such as account name, mobile number, and gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentity verification in Nigeria remains a problem for businesses and individuals. Because of the stress involved in obtaining official identities, many Nigerians only bother with getting official identity documents when they need them.\n\nSince registration for the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) began in 2012, the body reports that it has registered 54 million people, which is a long way off from Nigeria\u2019s population of 200 million. With the government not capturing enough citizens, private companies have stepped up to bridge the gap.\n\nFor businesses, especially eCommerce businesses, finding locations is difficult, and this means that delivery is rarely done in rural areas.\n\nThis is not the first attempt to solve the location problem in Nigeria with the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) partnering with What3words \u2014 a British startup \u2014 to extend delivery to 90% of Nigerian homes.\n\nLast year, Google launched Plus Codes to identify locations without defined addresses.\n\nHowever, unlike these solutions, VeriFind uses a combination of software and human agents to verify addresses.\n\nNigeria leads mobile app downloads in Africa\n\nSmartphone user\n\nMobile app installs in Nigeria grew by 43% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, according to a report by Appflyer and Google. South Africa came second with 37%, and Kenya third with 29%.\n\nA word of caution: With the report focusing on app installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, it might not be representative of the entire continent especially when you consider that these are some of Africa\u2019s largest markets in terms of smartphone penetration.\n\nThere\u2019s probably no aspect of our lives that the coronavirus pandemic did not affect. From working arrangements to the way we shop, the pandemic changed the way we live.\n\nThe way we use our mobile phones were also affected, as this report shows. Tracking data from 6,000 apps and 2 billion installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, the report indicates that installs increased by 41% across the three countries.\n\nWith more people on their phones due to the lockdown, the report reveals that in-app advertising revenue increased significantly, with 213% in South Africa, 141% in Nigeria, and 74% in Kenya.\n\nIn terms of in-app purchasing revenue, Q3 2020 saw the biggest increase resulting in 33% of 2020\u2019s in-app purchasing revenue. In-app purchasing revenue increased by 136% between July and September when compared to the previous three months.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fintech apps saw an increase in downloads, with South Africa and Nigeria seeing year-on-year growth rates of 116% and 60%, respectively.\n\nWhile the pandemic undoubtedly influenced this growth, it is unlikely that the mobile app market in these countries will experience a decline provided fintech startups continue providing excellent service. This could also accelerate the move to a cashless economy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nStop Saying You Want To Bank The Unbanked.

          "title": "Insecurity In Kaduna In Relation With Military-Police Formations \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nI am afraid of military-police formation in Kaduna that cannot protect our school children and allowed bandits to control the forests. Kaduna State is the most terrorize state by bandits and other criminals despite the presence of military-police formation. I must express my concern over the level of insecurity in the country and Kaduna in particular. Kaduna State has the highest number of military and police formation yet they could not flush out bandits hiding in forests. I have watched helplessly in Kaduna State where the President\u2019s efforts are not being replicated. Rather, we have a situation whereby deliberate acts of commission or omission and anarchy have taken over. The people of Kaduna State today are no longer feeling the impact of several military and police formation around them. I cannot explain the level of high insecurity in relation to several military-police formation in Kaduna State. There is several military-police formation yet there is no peace in Kaduna State. I am worried over what will happen if states without military-police formation have similar security challenge like the one in Kaduna. Nigerians need an explanation about insecurity in Kaduna with several military-police formation.\n\nThe following are List of Military and Police Formation in Kaduna State:\n\n* 1Division Nigerian Army Barracks.\n\n* Nigerian Army Depot, Zaria\n\n* Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji\n\n* Nigerian Defense Industry (NDI) Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Airforce Training School, Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Police College, Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Navy School of Armament, Kachia Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Army School of Legal Services, Bassawa Zaria\n\n* Nigerian Defense Academy (NDA) Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Army School of Artillery, Kachia Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Army School of Military Police, Bassawa Zaria\n\nI am worried that bandits and kidnappers operate freely without any challenge from the military and police formation located in Kaduna State. Mr. President is no doubt aware that no single day passes without massive killings, kidnappings, arson and wanton destruction of property in Kaduna State. The citizens and residents of Kaduna are becoming numb to serial publications of death and destruction every day.\n\nI must lament that \u201cfarming activities are being negatively impacted on a scale that will herald famine throughout the state. Trading and other normal activities of life are equally affected. Even performing religious obligations is becoming difficult as places of worship are routinely targeted, burnt and destroyed with attendant loss of lives and the military-police formation is helpless in Kaduna.\n\nThe Kaduna\u2013Abuja Road, Kaduna\u2013Kachia Road, Kaduna\u2013Zaria Road, Kaduna\u2013BirninGwari Road are all under siege of bandits and kidnappers yet the military-police formation is helpless in Kaduna. Businesses are daily relocating from Kaduna. Residents are helpless and go about their lives with trepidation. The military and police formation are helpless in the war against kidnappers and bandits in Kaduna State. What is wrong with Kaduna the only state in Nigeria with the highest number of military and police formation?\n\nThere is the virtual absence of governance as the whole Government in the State is a one-man affair. \u201cRegrettably, the Governor who carries himself like an Emperor and has stiffed normal discourse that can lead to constructive ideas and suggestions to tackle the myriad of security issues bedevilling the state. People have been threatened, arrested, prosecuted and targeted simply for raising their voices against the wanton destruction of lives and property.\n\nThere is today in Kaduna State such break down of public order and public safety to such extent that requires extraordinary measures to restore peace and security. There is, in addition, a clear and present danger of further and total breakdown of public safety in the state, which requires extraordinary measures to prevent such eventuality.\n\nI want to condemn the activities of insurgents, kidnappers and bandits in the North that their activities are killing the peace and progress for which the north was noted for when the founders of the region were in power. Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State recently said the menace of banditry is beyond the capacity of the Nigeria Police Force, and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC. El-Rufai made the remark while stressing that the Army, Nigerian Air Force, NAF, and Nigerian Navy should be deployed to effectively tackle banditry.\n\nDEATHS from insecurity in Kaduna State in 2020 were three times higher than those recorded in five states in the North-East within the same year, The ICIR came up with a report. On Wednesday, March 10, the Kaduna State government released the state security report for the year 2020, which shows that 937 persons were killed by bandits and other criminals in the state within the year. According to data obtained from the Nigerian Security Tracker, the figure is much higher than what was recorded within the year in five North-East states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe. Nigeria Security Tracker, sponsored by the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said there were 288 deaths due to insecurity in the five states within the period. Nigeria\u2019s Kaduna State has been embroiled in conflict for decades. The violence has its roots in ethnic tensions between the state\u2019s Muslim and non-Muslim populations.\n\nKaduna state is located in Northcentral Nigeria. It has a population of approximately 6.1 million people. The majority Hausa-Fulani tribe are predominantly Muslim and herders of cattle and the non-Muslim minority are mainly farmers. The conflict between these two groups most recently flared up in October 2018 when communal clashes left at least 55 people dead. The resurgence of violence provided a convenient talking point for President Muhammadu Buhari on his campaign trail. The president has made the fight against insecurity a big component of his campaign. But while he has talked tough about the violence he hasn\u2019t acted accordingly to ensure that peace prevails in Kaduna.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Kaduna\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Monday swore in newly-appointed Local Government Caretaker Committees in all the Local Government Areas, Local Council Development Areas, Area Councils and Administrative Offices, in the State.\n\nHe charged them to champion the progressive ideals by being magnanimous in victory and to run the affairs of their respective Councils with the fear of God, transparency, accountability, fairness and equity.\n\nOyetola directed the new Council heads to hit the ground running and ensure that they deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to the teeming citizens as part of efforts to permanently register the name of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the hearts of the citizens and leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\nThis is even as the Governor charged them to stretch the hands of partnership to fellow contestants who were not so privileged by embarking on a reconciliatory move to other party members.\n\nSpeaking during the swearing-in ceremony held at Multi-purpose Hall, Local Government Service Commission, Abere, Osogbo, Oyetola noted that his Administration had shun profligacy, corruption and other inimical behaviours that could jeopardise the quest for excellent and inspirational leadership. He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

          "title": "Euro 2020: England deserved to lose",
          "text": "By Tayo Ogunbiyi\n\nInitially, I rooted for Portugal to win the just concluded Euro 2020 soccer competition. However, after the Portuguese crashed out, I quickly pitched my tent with the French. Following the exit of the French, I switched allegiance to the English team.\n\nI chose to support the English for two reasons. One, they have made remarkable contributions to the development of the beautiful game, especially via the well-packaged English Premiership.\n\nSecond, they have had a lamentable history of near misses since they last won a major football competition in 1966 via the World Cup.\n\nAgainst the Italians at the final, my heart was fully with the English. However, like it sometimes happens in football, the demons of penalties swayed the outcome in favour of the Italians. It was quite painful to see the English lose in such hurting fashion, especially in front of their home fans.\n\nThe fallout of England\u2019s loss has, however, altered my romance with the English. Now, I am actually happy they lost the final.\n\nAs earlier noted, the final was decided by penalties. Ironically, three out of the English five penalties were taken and missed by three of their Black players-Marcus Rashford, 23, Bukayo Saka, 19 and Jadon Sancho 21.\n\nMinutes after the final match, hell was let loose on the social media as some English fans posted abusive racial messages that denigrated the personality of the players. All of them have since become victims of cruel social media venoms.\n\nA mural of Rashford, who had campaigned for poor children to be given more support during the pandemic, was also reportedly covered in abuse.\n\nThe issue of online abuse of players led to British soccer authorities briefly boycotting social media platforms before the Euro 2020 tournament.\n\nRacism remains a major issue in Europe, America and other parts of the world. But the dimension of the current episode is quite astounding.\n\nOne still finds it amazing that some fans chose to scapegoat the three Black players as being responsible for England\u2019s loss on the basis of their colour. This is quite disheartening considering what they have offered the English squad and fans over the years. This is so nauseating. If this is who the English are, then they don\u2019t deserve to win anything.\n\nBearing in mind all that the players in question have achieved for the English national team, they deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media.\n\nFor a long time, Black footballers in England have had to contend with the reality of racism. Many of them have boldly spoken out about the issue in recent times. Rashford, who missed England\u2019s third penalty, has spoken widely against the malady. Recently, he referred to the racist abuse he suffered from soccer fans as \u201chumanity and social media at its worst\u201d\n\nAt this year\u2019s Euro tournament, England\u2019s team took a knee before games in a demonstration against racial inequality, to the jeering of some fans.\n\nMusa Okwonga, an English soccer writer aptly captures the whole episode on Twitter: \u201cHate is a strong word. But the racist relying on Black English footballers to bring them glory as if they were their servants, then turning on them as soon as they fell short of their dreams, have my deepest contempt\u201d.\n\nSuch ridiculous two-faced tumble!\n\nAccording to the Late American civil rights activist, Martin Luther King Jnr., three major evils exist in the world. These, he said, are the evil of racism, the evil of poverty, and the evil of war.\n\nIn contemporary context, it would be a blunder to assume that racism no longer exists in our world. In Europe, America and other parts of the world, racism, sadly, remains a contentious subject.\n\nThe death of George Floyd drew widespread outrage last May, after a video circulated online showing Officer Derek Chawin holding his knee on the Late musician\u2019s neck as he gasped for breath, appropriately validating the shocking existence of racism in our world.\n\nBlack Lives Matter (BLM), a decentralised political and social movement protesting against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against black people, is a global response to the depressing reality of racism in modern society.\n\nCurrently, the attention of the world is focused on combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This is rightly so in view of its devastating effects on the global economy and all other aspects of life. But then, racism is a worse evil than COVID-19. It is highly contagious, easily transmitted to others, and too often unseen and disguised in those seemingly healthy. It is a social and spiritual disease that kills faster than COVID-19.\n\nThe antidote is for the whole world to unite against the evil of racism as it is doing against COVID-19. We must advocate unambiguous commitments to equal dignity and human rights all over the world.\n\nWe must condemn every form of racist tendency, no matter how subtle it seems.\n\nTo think that we are in the 21st century and some are still drawing us back to the era of the ignominious slave trade is, to say the least, appalling and foolish.\n\nWell, this is the right time to distinguish the wise from the foolish. The wise will opt to speak out against racism, while the foolish will overtly and covertly speak in its defence.\n\nIn the words of the Late Nelson Mandela, \u201cOur world is not divided by race, colour, gender or religion. Our world is divided into the wise people and fools. And the fools divide themselves by race, colour, gender or religion\u201d. How apt!\n\nAs for the three Black players and others who have been victims of horrific racial abuse, they should hold their heads high in glory. They are heroes, not villains.\n\nIt takes tremendous guts for a 19 year-old to opt to take decisive penalties in such a tension soaked match being watched by a global audience in excess of one billion. As we say in local parlance, thump up guys, \u2018nothing do you\u2019.\n\nSurely, your persecutors are in need of urgent medical attention!\n\n\u2013Ogunbiyi is Deputy Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Information and Strategy, Alausa, Ikeja",

          "title": "DSS Raid On Sunday Igboho\u2019s House Was Within The Law- Popular Lawyer, Daniel Bwala",
          "text": "Daniel Bwala, a popular Abuja based lawyer has given his opinion on the recent raid on Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho\u2019s home by DSS.\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) raided the residence of the Yoruba activist in Soka Ibadan, Oyo State, in the early hours (about 0134 hours) of 1st July, 2021, accusing him and his associates of planning a violent insurrection against the state.\n\nReacting to the incident, Bwala, who\u2019s also the Special Adviser to Deputy Senate President on Legal and Constitutional Matters at National Assembly of Nigeria describes the DSS operatives\u2019 action as lawful.\n\n\u201cWell from the perspective of law, a search warrant can be issued and can be executed at any time of the day even on weekend or public holidays. So you can execute a search warrant in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening even at night, at any time including Sunday and public holidays. That\u2019s section 148 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act. And the person who issues the search warrant is the judge or magistrate.\u201d He said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cNow the issues that have cropped up or arising from the attempt arrest of Igboho were one that governor should have been notified. There is nowhere in the law that it is stated that whenever the law enforcement is enforcing an arrest or a search warrant they need to notify or take permission from the governor. Probably the rationale behind that is law enforcement can even investigate a governor. When a governor has to be contacted then you are politicizing it, then there\u2019s the likelihood that the operation can be botched. That\u2019s number one. Then number two, this has to do with whether the law enforcement obtains a search or arrest warrant. It\u2019s always difficult to know, until after the arrest is effected. So the person who is arrested, when you come to arrest him, the law says, he has every right to demand that you show him the arrest warrant or search warrant. But if u look at section 148 sub 2, it says, when you go to execute the search warrant and the building on which you intend execute the search on is closed, you are to act within the prescription in section 9, 12 and 13 of the same Administration of Criminal Justice Act.\n\n\u201cAnd these sections that I have cited state in clear terms that you can use reasonable force to enter the place. So the law enforcement can come to execute arrest or search warrant order at any time. And if there is a resistance, the law says they can execute reasonable force in executing that. Now this is the position of the law and I choose to stay around it without having to look at the sentiment or the politics around it. Because once you bring that to fore, then the question is whether they can even go there or not which is not going to be premised on law but on sentiment. Now one of grounds that law enforcement agents or agencies can exercise the power to search or arrest you is when there is test of reasonability, that is when there is a reasonable doubt that you have committed an offence, you about to commit and offence or you are in a position of fire arm. These are conditions on which they can execute the search warrant for the purpose of discovering what is going to form part of their investigations or for the purpose of arresting you to stop you from committing the act.\u201d\n\nFemi Falana, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and human rights activists, is one of people who have publicly condemned the DSS operatives\u2019 action labelling it a criminal act. He revealed that there\u2019s no single phase in the constitution was it approved a midnight attack or even abduction by the government.\n\nSpeaking on Mr Falana\u2019s claim, Barrister Daniel Bwala said:\n\n\u201cThe claim by my \u2018Egbon\u2019 SAN Femi Falana, with the greatest respect it\u2019s not tenable and not guided by the law. Administration of Criminal Justice Act came into force in 2015. Even if you go to Criminal Procedure Law. For example, section 111 of the Criminal Procedure Law also supports section 148 in terms of executing search warrant any time of the day. What I have learnt from my practice, because search warrant can be executed anytime, it means you can go to the judge\u2019s house and have him sign a search warrant. Most time what EFFC does and I think it should be the same for DSS, you can go and get that order. And to get that order is not difficult. And when you go, all that the Magistrate or the judge needs from you is the face value. Whether there is a reasonable ground from the fact that you are suggesting that what you want to go and do in the eyes of the law can be seen as something worthwhile, because when you have effected the search or arrest, it\u2019s going to form part of the investigation. And by the time you are through with your investigation, you must definitely charge. So anytime you eventually come to the court and if there is no prima facie allegation established against the accused person, the law requires that the magistrate can decided to discharge the accused person. This is the premise. It can be executed against anybody in Nigeria, expect any person covered by immunity as prescribed by our law.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me tell you from experience. I rarely find a situation where DSS or EFCC effect an arrest or search without an order, it\u2019s almost impossible. The reason is this, any product of operation that is founded on illegality will affect the charges in court. If you arrest someone without an arrest warrant or you search somebody with a search warrant, it will be faulted in the face of the law. So the law enforcement often time, they may not announce that they have it, but if the for example the person is arrested, the person will be able to testify because the law requires you show it to him.\n\n\u201cAnd there is a part of the law which says as at the time you are coming to execute the search warrant and the person in question is resisting with lethal weapon, the law says you can exercise force that is proportionally reasonable. If the law enforcement come to exercise arrest and you try to resist by slapping them, they cannot use gun on you because that is not in compliance with proportionality. But if you use gun, they can use gun. In this case, there was a gun dwell. In a scenario where you have gun dwell it is very possible that destruction will occur. Assuming when they came, Igbogbo\u2019s men opened the door politely and these people decided to destroy things then they have exercise force that is not reasonable, the test of reasonability will go against the law enforcement.\u201d\n\nOn why the DSS usually carries out operations at night, the lawyer has this to say:\n\n\u201cThe reason why DSS in particular execute operation at night is to minimize casualty. Igboho is a well-known personality loved by is People. You remember a time when EFCC went to Epe, Lagos to effect a search on the house of former governor, they were chased out by the community. This are the type of things that could have been avoided if they went at night. In the case of DSS from my little understand on why they operate at night is because of their logo; Owl. Owl sees at night. You will rarely see DSS operate during the day and that is because they want to minimize casualty. If they had gone to Igboho\u2019s house during the day, there\u2019s every likelihood that those who even went to perform the operation would have been killed. And secondly in a bid to resist the resistance of the people. Because they would be surrounded by a mammoth crowd and you are likely going to fight a pandemonium that if care is not taken will lead to national crisis.\u201d",
          "summary": "Daniel Bwala, a popular Abuja based lawyer has given his opinion on the recent raid on Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho\u2019s home by DSS.\nProbably the rationale behind that is law enforcement can even investigate a governor.\nThen number two, this has to do with whether the law enforcement obtains a search or arrest warrant.\nSo the law enforcement can come to execute arrest or search warrant order at any time.\nWhat I have learnt from my practice, because search warrant can be executed anytime, it means you can go to the judge\u2019s house and have him sign a search warrant.",

          "text": "The Senate Wednesday faulted the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for under remitting the sum of N3, 878, 955, 039, 855.73 trillion revenues from domestic crude oil sales to the Federation Account for the period of January to December 2015.\n\nAccordingly, the upper chamber called on the Corporation to desist from further deductions at source as this contravenes Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nIt also mandated the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) or any other approving authority to, as a matter of urgency, approve agreed percentage which should be allocated to NNPC monthly as operational cost to ensure their operations were not adversely affected.\n\nThis formed part of the 59 recommendations adopted by the Senate and contained in the report of the Committee on Public Accounts on the Annual report of the Auditor-General for the Federation on the Accounts of the Federation for the years ended 31st December, 2015.\n\nIn one of its adopted recommendations to the Executive arm of government, the Senate noted that the outstanding collection from Solid Minerals (N12,137,140,361.58) not remitted to the Federation Account, but kept in an account maintained by the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) contravenes the provisions of Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThe chamber, therefore, charged the FAAC to fix a percentage to be allocated to Mining and Cadastral Office as cost of collection as is currently applicable to NCS (7 percent), DPR (4 percent) and FIRS (4 percent) of non-oil revenue.\n\nErring MDAs for sanction\n\nOn Unretired Advances involving 39 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to the tune of N2, 296,567,084.37 billion, the red chamber demanded the sanctioning of accounting officers of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in accordance with the provision of Rule 3124 of Financial Regulations.\n\nIt also issued the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris a deadline of 60 days to identify and sanction officers responsible for mismanagement of public funds to the tune of N54,151,360,000 billion ($274,280,000.00) as exchange loss on External Loans.\n\nThe Accountant General is expected to report back to the Senate Committee on Public Accounts within ninety days.\n\nIn addition, the Senate gave another 60-day timeline for the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to set in motion the process of recovery of Internal Loans made from other Funds which stand at N390,288,085,668.92 billion and to be paid back into the Special Funds Accounts.\n\nThe source of the loans are from the Development of Natural Resources Account, Stabilisation Fund Account, 25 percent Husked Brown Rice Levy, One percent Comprehensive Supervision Scheme (CISS) Pool Levy, 15 percent Wheat Grain Levy, and 10 percent Rice Levy.\n\nIn another vein, the upper chamber directed the Accountant-General of the Federation to recover the sum of N378, 879, 674.99 tax revenue from Webb Fontaine Ltd and remit same to the Federal Inland Revenue Service within six (6) months.\n\nIt also called for a review of all companies that were paid from the outflow of one percent CISS Account which amounted to N39, 557, 671,843.97.\n\nNPA over lack of diligence\n\nThe upper chamber also directed the Nigerian Ports Authority to refund the sum of $37,627,939.75million (USD) to the federal government coffers due to lack of diligence in the review of NPA\u2019s charges on a contract of towage services.\n\nThe lawmakers also mandated the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), to subject the Accounting Officer to investigation in accordance with Rule 3112 (I and II) of the Financial Regulations.\n\nThey further demanded that the Director-General who authorised the disbursement of contingency provision on the contract for the rehabilitation of Lagos Habour moles to the tune of N417,099,309.06billion without Federal Executive Council approval, should be reported to President Muhammadu Buhari in accordance with Rule 3103 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nOn other funds diverted by the NPA, the Senate demanded a refund of various sums in local and foreign currencies, consisting of N1, 075, 266,599.06, $2,301,329.54 (USD), and \u20ac196,257.42 (Euros) meant for the Presidential Implementation Committee on Marine Safety and Security (PICOMSS) to the account of the National Security Adviser to the o President, contrary to a directive approved by the Federal Executive Council on February 21, 2007.\n\nIt added that the non-remittance of another N67, 508, 041,250.00 for 2013 and 2014 into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), being 25 percent of its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) contravened the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\nThe Senate also noted that the failure to remit capitalized interest to the Consolidated Revenue Fund totaling N99, 712, 464.24 between 2013 and 2014 contravened Rule 236 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nInfractions at FMPR\n\nOn financial infractions by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Senate called for the sanction of the Permanent Secretary in accordance with Rule 3129 of the Financial Regulations and Public Service Rules 030402 over the diversion of N23,642,000.00 from the Capital Projects Funds for Sallah/Christians\u2019 welfare package to staff of the Ministry.\n\nThe upper chamber queried the sums of N46, 645, 000.00 and N56, 418,135.00 for the printing of the Ministry\u2019s letter-headed paper, and demanded that the sum be recovered and paid back to the treasury.\n\nIt also called for the identification of the Project Accountant who authorised the diversion of N32, 783, 052.00 meant for IPPIS training and other programmes to bank accounts of staff of Finance and Accounts Department, instead of paying the approved amounts to beneficiaries.\n\nThey demanded the refund of the amount to government coffers, including the sum of N718, 911,848.00 made in the cashbook as payments to eleven corporate bodies without documentation.\n\nIn addition, the chamber called on the ministry to identify and present for disciplinary action, the officers behind the authorisation of N98, 400, 000.00 in favour of a company for printing of leaflets for the Petroleum Industry Bill awareness campaign programme; N54, 000, 000.00 to a company for assessment and documentation of Oil Spill sites in ten (10) states of the Niger Delta; and N25, 000,000.00 for actualising e-governance procedure.\n\nThe infractions, the Senate noted, were in violation of Rule 3117.\n\nWants NSC sanctioned\n\nThe body therefore called on the EFCC to prosecute within 30 days, the officers in the Ministry of Youths and Sports (National Sports Commission) who certified the payment of N37, 185, 000.00 from the Capital Vote allocation.\n\nIt also directed that N2, 695, 985.00 be recovered from the emolument of the Director-General of the Small Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), who authorised that the sum be paid to individuals instead of a company\u2019s account.\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, also demanded the prosecution of the Accounting Officer with SMEDAN who approved the sum of N38, 038,238.14 without relevant and supporting documents in contravention to extant laws.\n\nIn meting further disciplinary actions, the chamber called on the EFCC to prosecute within thirty days, officers of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading PLC (NBET) who were behind the non-remittance of accrued interest on investment in Nigeria Treasury Bills.\n\nHospitals also\n\nIt also sought the prosecution of officers of the National Hospital, Abuja, and the Rural Electrification Agency within the same time frame, who were involved in the diversion of N20, 915, 998.00 and N14, 086,246.00, respectively.\n\nIt requested the Medical Director of the Jos University Teaching Hospital to refund the sum of N26,321,041.01; and the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Aro, Abeokuta to pay back N19,382,047.50 to the Treasury and the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), Abuja, to remit the sums of N3,716,805,388.00, N100,958,369.61, N374,734,768.46 and N161,336,427.80 to the CRF and Treasury.",

          "text": "Support group under the auspices of APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption campaign is built on establishing preventive systems and mechanisms that promote lasting accountability rather than the conventional arrest and prosecution method.\n\nIn a statement issued Wednesday and signed by four prominent members of the party: Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi, Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, the legacy group cited the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), the Treasury Single Account (TSA), the Personnel Information System (IPPIS), and the whistleblowing policy as some of the mechanisms instituted by the Buhari administration to prevent corruption from taken place in the system.\n\nThe APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign, which is a voluntary think-tank group of the governing party, further maintained that the Buhari Administration also established the Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit (PICA) to strengthen controls over Government finances through a continuous internal audit process across all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), particularly in respect of payroll, noting that PICA has helped to identify and remove more than 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries, amounting to savings of N200 billion per annum.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn the life of the administration, the President established the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), to sign-post to the world the significance of the fight against corruption to his administration. It was the very first committee the President set up after he was sworn into office.\n\n\u201cSince inception PACAC has helped produce manuals, protocols and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to assist Anti-Corruption Agencies (ACAs) in their work, including a Corruption Case Management Manual; Plea Bargaining Manual; Sentencing Guidelines in High Profile Cases; a Framework for the Management of Recovered Stolen Assets, Asset Recovery Strategy Document, among others.\n\n\u201cAlso in August 2015, President Buhari issued his first major Presidential Order, directing all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to close their accounts with Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and transfer their balances to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system under the oversight of the Central Bank of Nigeria, on or before 15th September 2015. The TSA system, launched in 2012, had struggled to gain traction until President Buhari\u2019s executive order. More than 17,000 commercial bank accounts have since been closed down, resulting in savings of an average of N4 billion monthly, in banking charges; apart from the increased transparency and accountability that comes from the new system.\n\n\u201cSimilar to the TSA is the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), through which the Federal Government pays its staff. Like the TSA it was inherited from previous administrations, but with limited coverage. Since 2015 President Buhari has mandated expansion of coverage, in spite of great opposition, so that today it now covers virtually all of the Federal Government, including the Armed Forces, as well as Federal Universities and other academic institutions.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblowing Policy introduced by the Government in December 2016 was the first of its kind in the country. Since then it has yielded several billions of Naira in recoveries from tax evaders and public officials.\n\n\u201cThe increased oversight of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and their finances under this Administration has since started yielding results, through increased remittance of operating surpluses by MDAs. For example, from remitting only N51 million between 2010 and 2016, JAMB has gone on to remit more than 20 billion Naira to the Federal Government since 2017. This same scenario is being replicated across several MDAs.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari Administration also established the Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit (PICA) to strengthen controls over Government finances through a continuous internal audit process across all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), particularly in respect of payroll. PICA helped identify and remove more than 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries, amounting to savings of N200 billion per annum.\n\n\u201cIn July 2016, Nigeria became the 70th country in the world to join the Open Government Partnership (OGP), as part of efforts to globally mainstream Nigeria\u2019s public transparency efforts.\n\n\u201cOther transparency and anti-corruption initiatives of the Buhari Administration include Project Lighthouse, launched in 2018 to integrate multiple tax and revenue data sources from across the government and third parties (land records, CAC records, REMITA platform, Private Jet Ownership data, FIRS database, etc) and thus help ensure accurate income and tax assessment for individual and corporate taxpayers.\u201d",

That\u2019s the area of support we will give.\n\n\u201cOther than that, we also intend to pass on what we have seen today to the appropriate MDAs, the Federal Ministry of Education to ensure the support that JAMB needs is given to them.\u201d\n\nThe committee noted that candidates should not be admitted into the university below the age of 18 as age has a lot to do with his learning ability.\n\nThe senator, who stressed the importance of education to the development and future of Nigeria, said the sector deserves maximum attention as good quality education can only be achieved through funding and commitment of teachers and students.\n\nWhile describing JAMB as a bridge between the secondary and the university, she said the agency was a necessary vehicle for the delivery of quality and standard education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf the products from the secondary schools are not properly catered for to be assessed before turning them into the university definitely you will have a problem,\u201d she said.\n\nThe committee however queried why JAMB had almost 100% performance of its 2020 budget and over N500 million devoted to staff welfare apart from their regular salaries.\n\nResponding to the alleged poor performance, Oloyede who spoke earlier said\n\nUTME is not a certification exam; hence, there cannot be an issue of mass failure. He maintained that the introduction of National Identity Number, NIN helped curb examination malpractice.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t know that in the ranking exam there is no pass or fail. You can\u2019t fail it, you are just ranking them because what qualify candidates for university education is not UTME, what qualifies you is five O level credits so, it is assumed all of them have five O level credits.\n\nHe further said that \u201cWhen we released the last results those who are making noise are the proprietors of schools and tutorial masters because of the money they have collected from the parents and their ability in the past to cut corners and get inflated results for people.\n\nOloyede explained that the budget of the board was only 75 per cent implemented as the government issued a directive that 25 per cent of funds budgeted should be returned to the federation account.",

          "title": "Messi Agrees Five-year Barcelona Contract, Takes Huge Pay Cut: ESPN",
          "text": "Lionel Messi and Barcelona have reached an agreement for the forward to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, with star accepting a significant wage reduction to prolong his stay, ESPN reports.\n\nMessi was a free agent after his contract at Barca expired and he had courted interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City since first revealing a desire to end his 20-year relationship with Barca last summer. The 34-year-old\u2019s previous contract was worth over \u20ac500 million over four years and that expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30.\n\nHowever, with the return of Joan Laporta as president in March, Messi grew more open to staying at Camp Nou. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.\n\nLaporta had hoped to finalise an agreement before Messi\u2019s previous terms expired. Barca\u2019s financial problems made that impossible, though, with their gross debt over \u20ac1 billion. Cutbacks have been essential, in terms of transferring players out, reducing the wage bill and getting Messi to accept a lower salary.\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas had warned Barca they would not be allowed to register Messi\u2019s new deal if they were unable to reduce spending to comply with the league\u2019s financial fair play rules. Barca\u2019s spending limit has been reduced from over \u20ac600m to \u20ac347m since the coronavirus pandemic, with further reductions expected to be imposed for the upcoming season.\n\nMessi is on holiday with his family following his Copa America glory with Argentina last weekend, which was his first senior trophy with his national team.\n\nHe will link up with Ronald Koeman\u2019s squad later in the summer, with Barca\u2019s league campaign kicking off on August 15 against Real Sociedad at Camp Nou.\n\nMessi had first expressed a desire to leave Barca last August after the 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. His relationship with then-president Josep Maria Bartomeu had reached a breaking point. In a September 2020 interview with Goal, after Barca had blocked his departure, Messi called Bartomeu a \u201cliar\u201d and said the board had been \u201cmaking things up as they go along\u201d and \u201cplugging holes\u201d for years.\n\nBartomeu, facing a vote of no confidence, resigned last October and was eventually replaced by Laporta in March. Laporta has a good relationship with Messi and his family. He was Barca\u2019s president when Messi made his first-team debut and when he signed his first professional contract with the club.\n\nThe report claims that Laporta was working on a contract renewal for Messi in April that included the option of playing in Major League Soccer before returning to Barcelona.\n\nIn public and in private, Laporta had always maintained that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d he could persuade Messi to stay. The club have already made a series of signings this summer, bringing in Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia, as well as recalling Emerson Royal.\n\nMessi first joined Barca\u2019s academy in 2000 and has gone on to play 778 games for the club, breaking Xavi Hernandez\u2019s appearance record last season. He has scored 672 goals, another club record, and has helped Barca win, among other trophies, 10 La Liga titles and the Champions League on four occasions.",

          "text": "Nigerian grammy award winning Burna Boy alongside Ed Sheeran will lead a group of artistes to perform at the Global Citizen live concert aimed at uniting the world, defending the planet and defeating poverty.\n\nGlobal Citizen, an International advocacy organization in a statement on Wednesday said the event will be a 24-hour Live broadcast with events and performances filmed across six continents and will air on several networks and as well stream on several social media platforms.\n\nOther top artistes and entertainers expected to perform at the September 25 event are Davido, Femi Kuti, Tiwa Savage appearing alongside Adam Lambert, Doja Cat, Coldplay, Usher, H.E.R., Angelique Kidjo, Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, DJ Snake, Duran Duran, Lizzo, Lorde, Ricky Martin, The Weeknd, and more to be announced.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is powered by citizens around the world who are taking action together with governments, corporations and philanthropists to make change.\n\nThe campaign calls on businesses and philanthropists to contribute resources needed to protect and restore at least 1 billion trees by 2022 to curb climate change; and provide meals for the more than 40 million people on the brink of starvation.\n\nThe 24-hour live broadcast event will feature artists, activists, and world leaders taking the stage at iconic locations across the globe, including: live events in Central Park in New York City, and the Champ de Mars in Paris; live-crosses from London, and Los Angeles; and performances and hosted segments from Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Sydney. Additional locations and location-specific details will be announced in August.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has drastically reversed the progress toward achieving the United Nations Global Goals, pushing upwards of 160 million people back into extreme poverty and more than 40 million to the brink of starvation. Progress on climate change has halted, as the majority of the Fortune 500 fail to set science-based carbon reduction targets. We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together. \u2018Equitable recovery\u2019 is not an act of charity \u2013 it is the only way we can ensure a fighting chance at achieving a sustainable world free from extreme poverty.\u201d \u2013 Hugh Evans, CEO, Global Citizen said in a press release.\n\nThe release also quoted Nigeria\u2019s minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama as saying, \u201cAs we humans spend billions of dollars in search of newer worlds in outer space, Global Citizen Live brings us back down to earth by reminding the global community that charity should begin at home and we must preserve our earth and be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers. We owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn. Space can wait!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to perform at the Global Citizen Live concert this year. The timing for this call for unity couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Angelique Kidjo. \u201cThere is an urgent need for us to work together across the globe and take action to protect our planet. Mother nature has a way of warning us. We need each other now,\u201d Angelique Kidjo said.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live and the organization\u2019s Recovery Plan for the World are supported by a coalition of many of the world\u2019s leading corporations including its Global Partners: Accenture, Cisco, Citi, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G, Verizon, and campaign partner WW International, who will work together to engage support from the 8private sector in driving new commitments toward the campaign\u2019s policy objectives. Access Bank, will also support the Global Citizen Live campaign as a partner in Nigeria.\n\nFor the past decade, Global Citizen has championed the most pressing social and environmental issues and joined the fight to end COVID-19, most recently with VAX Live: The Concert To Reunite The World in May, which mobilized more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and $302 million to the ACT-Accelerator for equitable health access to countries most in need.\n\nSince March 2020, Global Citizen has mobilized $2 billion in cash grants to fund global pandemic relief efforts, and over 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.\n\nFrancis, 84, sat in the passenger seat of the Ford car, which left Rome\u2019s Gemelli Polyclinic around 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT; 4:45 a.m. EDT). He made a stop to pray at Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, which has a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary which Francis always visits after returning home from a foreign trip.\n\nAfter the brief stop, Francis\u2019 small motorcade approached a side entrance to the Vatican. The Ford stopped before reaching the gate and Francis got out with the help of a bodyguard. He greeted some Italian security guards \u2014 two army soldiers standing guard and a handful of Italian police motorcycle escorts \u2014 and got back in the car, which then entered the Vatican through the Perugino gate.\n\nFrancis had half of his colon removed for a severe narrowing of his large intestine on July 4, his first major surgery since he became pope in 2013. It was a planned procedure, scheduled for early July when the pope\u2019s audiences are suspended anyway and Francis would normally take some time off.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, confirmed Francis\u2019 return from the hospital and visit to the Rome basilica. Praying before the icon, Francis \u201cexpressed his gratitude for the success of his surgery and offered a prayer for all the sick, especially those he had met during his stay in hospital,\u201d Bruni said in the statement.\n\nFrancis will have several more weeks to recover before beginning to travel again in September. There are plans for him to visit Hungary and Slovakia in a Sept. 12-15 trip, and then make a quick stop in Glasgow, Scotland, in November to participate in the COP26 climate conference. Other possible trips are also under review.\n\nThe Vatican had originally said Francis could be discharged last weekend, but later said he would stay a few days extra for further recovery and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe pope appeared for the first time in public since the surgery on Sunday, looking in good form as he delivered his weekly prayer from the 10th floor hospital balcony, surrounded by young cancer patients. He used the occasion to call for free health care for all.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the eve of his release, he visited the pediatric cancer ward, which is located on the same floor as the papal hospital suite.\n\nThe Argentine pope had part of one lung removed when he was a young man but has otherwise enjoyed relatively robust health.",
