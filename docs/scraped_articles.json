          "text": "Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has advised Christians to actively participate in politics and stop seeing it as dirty if they want to have a positive impact on society.\n\nMr Diri gave the advice while speaking at the end of a two-day programme of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, tagged \u201cLight Up Bayelsa Holy Ghost Rally\u201d in Yenagoa on Thursday.\n\nHe urged Christians not to stay away from politics or remain unconcerned but rather join to influence decision-making for the good of the generality of the people.\n\nMr Diri said Nigeria is in dire need of people that would salvage it from its many challenges, adding that the church should not be docile in the face of insecurity, corruption and other vices threatening the country.\n\nThe governor stated that under his administration, peace had come to stay in the state and that the days when people resort to violence to settle differences are over.\n\nSpeaking about his achievements, Diri said within two years in the saddle, his administration had changed the landscape through various projects, ranging from road infrastructure, educational and health structures to lighting up of the major roads and building of a mega media complex.\n\nMr Diri, who expressed joy that the programme coincided with activities marking his second year in office, declared that his administration had adopted it as part of its second-anniversary celebrations.\n\nHe thanked the RCCG General Overseer, Enoch Adeboye, for his support for his administration.\n\n\u201cYou are a good father.

          "title": "Tired of hawking, Plateau women seek better life",
          "text": "We\u2019ve empowered women in our own way \u2014 Commissioner\n\nBy Marie-Therese Nanlong, Jos\n\nTHOSE who are familiar with the Terminus area of Jos, Plateau State, would recall the popular sculpture of the famous woman known as \u201cMama Tapgun\u201d with slippers on her feet, several babies strapped to her back and a big basin laden with groceries on her head, hawking.\n\nThe stature was erected in 1992 by the Fidelis Tapgun administration to depict and demonstrate the resilience and industry of typical Plateau women who try to defy all odds to cater for their families. According to Katdapba Gobum, a former State Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, \u201cthe effigy showed that the spirit of a Plateau woman cannot be dampened despite challenging circumstances, as they always strive to fend for themselves using legitimate means to survive.\u201d\n\nThe symbol is, however, more typical of women from the Miango and Kwall districts of the Irigwe Chiefdom, Bassa Local Government Area of the State who defy all odds, sometimes with pregnancy or babies on their backs to hawk yams, fruits, vegetables and other edibles on the streets of Jos. However, what the Tapgun regime saw as a bold symbol of womanhood and the can-do-spirit of entrepreneurship was seen from a negative perspective by the administration of former Governor Jonah Jang, who saw it as demeaning to womanhood and a portrayal of poverty and squalor in the state capital. He quickly pulled it down.\n\nTo justify the destruction of the figurine and appease women in the state, the Jang administration declared a state of emergency in education and urged young girls to embrace formal education as a means of lifting them out of poverty and to achieve their set goals in life. But as the government did not do much to push the agenda to a logical conclusion, many women could not get access to the promised education. As a result, the disdainful tradition of women strapping their babies on their backs and hawking groceries is still active and booming in the agrarian state.\n\nAs a result of the persistence of the primitive tradition, it is a common sight to see women along major streets and busy areas like markets, motor parks and petrol stations carrying tubers of yam on their heads, walking the length and breadth of Jos, seeking out buyers. They seem to be immune to the elements as they defy intense heat and biting cold, with tired-looking babies strapped to their backs to sell their wares. Women in the past might have \u2018enjoyed\u2019 street hawking to fend for their families but today\u2019s women are uncomfortable with this and seek a better deal.\n\nPatience Barry, in her 30s and with basic education, told Arewa Voice that she learnt the practice of street hawking at a tender age from her mother as they used to hawk anything that was available in each season. But she confessed that she was fed up with the demeaning trade and that it was time to take up something more dignifying and less stressful to her and her family. She said: \u201cI used to come from Miango to Jos with my mother so that we could hawk anything in season \u2013 be it yam, banana, waterleaf, pepper, tomatoes, pawpaw or anything that could to help feed the family. It was a difficult life but we had to survive. My mother was not educated. I only passed through primary school but I have six children, including four girls; some of them are in secondary school. I train them from the proceeds of hawking but this is not the life I want for my children.\n\n\u201cAlthough I go with my girls during holidays, I do not want them to end up this way and I encourage them to do well in school. My mother died not making any significant progress; I am still struggling but I know that if my girls excel in school, they will end this cycle.\u201d\n\nPrecious Agah, however, blamed her lot on lack of care from political leaders, saying: \u201cHawking is a tedious work anytime but we have no support from anywhere. Even those with husbands are not having their needs met as the people in government do not care if we live or die. Thus, rather than stealing or prostituting, we hawk to survive. For some of us there is no shame but our major problems have to do with fatigue and accumulating debts from those who buy on credit and will not pay.\n\n\u201cAnother problem we encounter is the potential buyers\u2019 attitude. They sometimes price the goods below the cost price and when we do not find any buyer we sell at discounted rate thereby incurring serious debts just to have relief from carrying the perishable goods about. I believe if government officials who see us in the streets and sometimes buy from us can empower us; this stress of moving about will be greatly reduced.\u201d\n\nHowever, the State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Rebecca Sambo, has argued that the state government is doing its best to empower women in the State. Her words, \u201cWe have offices that deal with women in terms of empowerment; the SIP and PLASMIDA are helping women and youths in that aspect.\n\n\u201cThe office of the First Lady is also giving empowerment to women and training to young girls in our Ministry and we have been empowering women even with intervention from the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs. The wife of the President too also intervened at a time to lift Plateau women. What this means is that if a particular woman or women group did not benefit from these intervention schemes, it cannot be said that it is neglect on the part of the state government.\u201d\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",

Your Excellency, I beg to, somewhat, disagree with you on the general state of insecurity in the country, which is presently, in a state of near collapse. Of more concern to me is your claims with respect to the Niger Delta or the South-South zone.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, a good amount of peace has come to the Niger Delta in the past few years. However, your claim as having been the main architect that brought the peace, does not properly convey what transpired. If you will recall, before your government came on board, insecurity which had reduced substantially during the tenure of your predecessor, resumed in a very alarming rate. The period saw the emergence of a new group, the Niger Delta Avengers, which virtually held your government hostage, oil production went down to as low as about 800,000 barrels per day. Your government adopted a military approach to quell the agitations, by deploying the so-called \u2018Operation Crocodile Smile\u2019 in August, 2016, which did not in any way solve the problem.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

He also warned against ending the amnesty programme for repentant militants.\n\n\u201cMr. President, may I make it very clear to you that the area is sitting on a keg of gunpowder, and any attempt to scrap the amnesty program may produce unpleasant consequences to all. Our people are very conscious of the developments that your government is carrying out in other areas of the country with monies derived from oil exploration in their area.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, federal roads in the Niger Delta region have mostly collapsed and applying these funds to rehabilitate these collapsed roads, would have gone a long way to solve some of our problems.\n\n\u201cPlease Mr. President, I respectfully wish to state that your claim of bringing peace to the South-South geo-political zone, is untenable, untrue and without foundation. The deliberate neglect of the South-South, can lead to the explosion of the keg of gunpowder upon which we are sitting in the Niger Delta,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Buhari Unveils BUA Cement\u2019s Plant in Sokoto, Calls for More Private Sector Investment",
          "text": "*Emefiele appeals to manufacturers to address high cost of cement, building materials\n\n*Rabiu: BUA to ramp up cement production to 17 million metric tonnes next year\n\nObinna Chima, Deji Elumoye and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called for increased private sector investment in the country, assuring that his administration would continue to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive. Buhari also addressed the security challenges confronting the country and said his administration was committed to ensuring that peace reigned in every nook and cranny of the country.\n\nThe president spoke in Sokoto, at the inauguration of an ultra-modern three million metric tonnes per annum BUA Cement Sokoto line four factory. He expressed delight in his administration\u2019s policies on economic diversification, job creation, and creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, saying they are working.\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, in his address at the ceremony, urged manufacturers in the country to urgently control the rising prices of cement and other building materials.\n\nIn his remarks, Founder and Chairman of BUA Group, Alhaji Abdul Samad Rabiu, disclosed that his company was targeting to ramp up its total production capacity to 17 million metric tonnes of cement per annum next year.\n\nBuhari pledged that his administration would continue to support serious investors to set up businesses that would take advantage of the huge reservoir of resources in different parts of the country.\n\nThe president said, \u201cAs you all know, one of the key economic pillars of our administration has been to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. This is necessary for job creation and, indeed, for our economy and national security.\n\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, I visited Ogun and Kaduna states, where I observed many private sector investments in action. And today, I am here in Sokoto to commission this multi-billion Naira project.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, very clear for all to see that our policies are working. Progress is gradually being made in all parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised his commitment to peace and stability in all parts of Nigeria, listing a raft of measures undertaken by this administration to ensure that normalcy returned to troubled areas.\n\nAccording to Buhari, \u201cWe continue to recruit and equip security personnel while expanding our social investment programmes to support the youth and some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n\n\u201cYou should all be reassured that we will win this battle against the criminal elements looking to destabilise our nation by hindering the progress of our economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Rabiu and the entire team for the great work they were doing in supporting the government\u2019s economic diversification and job creation agenda. He noted that the company, which had completed four new cement plants of similar capacity in the last five years in different parts of the country and was set to complete two more plants soon, had shown through these investments that they believed in Nigeria and its potential.\n\nCommending BUA and other entrepreneurs for making Nigeria self-sufficient in cement and a net exporter of the strategic product, the president said, \u201cI am pleased that through these investments, BUA Cement has created employment opportunities for our citizens. Today, BUA is the largest employer of labour in the North-west region.\n\n\u201cI always remind Nigerians that every region, indeed, every state, in Nigeria sits on huge reserves of resources. For example, in this area, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara can boast of rice production, gold and other precious metals development and, of course, heavy industries like cement manufacturing.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we introduced policies and mechanisms to support such investments in a legal, ethical and inclusive manner. For example, we have the National Food Security Council on Food Security Matters and the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative to develop local artisanal gold mining and ensure health and safety of mining workers and protect the environment.\n\n\u201cWe remain prepared to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of these opportunities through value addition so as to take advantage of the huge market here, as well as in the greater African region and the world at large.\u201d\n\nHighlighting other efforts to bring even development to all parts of the country, Buhari expressed confidence that the Ajaokuta\u2013Kaduna\u2013Kano (AKK) gas project, when completed, will bring gas for domestic and industrial purposes from the South-south to the South-east, North-central, and North-west geopolitical zones. He said the AKK project would significantly reduce the cost of operation for industries in the regions.\n\nThe president also reassured Nigerians that his government would continue to invest heavily in roads and rails to ease movement of people, goods and services, with a view to facilitating trade, while lowering logistics costs associated with the inefficiencies of bad roads and bridges.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI want to now call on all entrepreneurs and businesses to emulate what is being done here. The task of nation building requires all hands to be on deck. The public and private sectors must collaborate if we are to achieve our aim of collective peace and prosperity across the entire nation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Emefiele urged manufacturers to urgently address the rising prices of building materials, including cement.\n\nNigerians have continued to lament the soaring price of cement in recent times and urge the government to intervene.\n\nEmefiele stressed that manufacturers must first strive to satisfy the local market to help make cement affordable before exporting the product to external markets.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, there has recently been calls by construction companies urging our steel and cement manufacturers to do something about the sky-rocketing of these two essential items in the construction industry.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the cement industry remained key to solving the country\u2019s unemployment challenges as well as boosting growth.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are aware that some of our cement manufacturers are producing for both the domestic and export markets, but we urge them to pay more attention to satisfying the domestic needs so as to bring down prices.\u201d\n\nEmefiele reiterated the apex bank\u2019s commitment to providing needed support for importation of spares, plants and equipment needed to increase the production capacities of cement plants in the country. While calling on prospective investors to take advantage of the current incentives provided by government to boost the sector, he said the CBN was ready to provide the needed financing for both current and new investors in the industrial sector for the importation of requisite machinery.\n\nHe pointed out that as part of the efforts by the current administration to drive productivity in the industrial sector and conserve foreign exchange, a decision was taken by the government in 2015 to restrict access to foreign exchange for imports of 43 items, which could be produced in Nigeria, but for which billions of US Dollars were being expended annually on imports.\n\nThe CBN governor said cement was one of the restricted items, adding that in making the decision, government was aware that the key raw material required for the production of cement is limestone, which is readily available across the country. He said the decision of the apex bank to ban cement importation had yielded great results, pointing out that the country\u2019s cement production capacity has since more than doubled from 30 MTPA in 2014 to 60 MTPA in 2021.\n\nThe CBN governor said no dollar had been spent from the country\u2019s reserves on cement importation in the past seven years following the restriction placed on the importation of the commodity.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur nation has been able to conserve billions of dollars, as no dollar from our external reserves has been spent on imports of cement into the country in the last seven years.\u201d\n\nHe said the investments had saved and created several thousands of jobs across multiple sectors.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the achievements so far recorded in the cement sector were not a coincidence but a reflection of the success of the backward integration policy of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe CBN governor said with significant opportunities in housing, construction and related industries, there were still sufficient room for additional investments in the sector. He urged potential investors to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nHe also assured current and prospective investors in the industrial sector that the apex bank was ready to collaborate with stakeholders to facilitate the development of a viable manufacturing sector in Nigeria.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cFor those who are willing to invest in new Greenfields or existing Brownfield projects, the CBN will provide all the support needed both in naira and dollars to import plant and equipment to actualise your dreams.\u201d\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s stance was in harmony with the apex bank\u2019s resolve to create a professional and people-oriented central bank to act as financial catalyst for job creation and inclusive growth in Nigeria.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cI am particularly delighted to see that the painstaking efforts and ingenuity of Nigeria\u2019s private sector are yielding bountiful fruits in broad daylight.\n\n\u201cThese efforts, such as the one being displayed here today by the BUA Group, are critical complementary ingredients to reducing unemployment and boosting production activities in our country.\n\n\u201cNot least, also, these investments help to support the CBN\u2019s mandate of promoting stable macro-economic growth in the country.\n\n\u201cI would, therefore, like to congratulate the BUA Group led by its inspirational and imitable Group CEO, Alhaji Adbul Samad Rabiu, for this investment.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated further, \u201cThe BUA Group\u2019s investment in Sokoto and in other parts of Nigeria reflects their belief in our country, and in the immense opportunities available in the industrial sector, given the abundance of human and natural resources in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this facility, which cost millions of US Dollars, was fully funded by equity contributions of the BUA Group without resorting to any source of external finance\u2026\n\n\u201cFollowing implementation of this new directive, I am pleased to note that the production capacity of the cement industry in Nigeria has doubled from 30 million tonnes in 2014 to about 60m tonnes in 2021.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome address, Rabiu recalled that Buhari inaugurated the second line of the cement company\u2019s plant in 1985 when he was Head of State.\n\nThe industrialist pointed out that in the past six years, \u201cWe have completed four plants \u2013 two in Obu, Edo State and two in Sokoto (of which this Sokoto line 4 is the fourth) with BUA\u2019s total production capacity now standing at 11 million tonnes with the completion of this plant.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that next year, BUA Group intended to complete the construction of two new plants of three million metric tonnes each, saying construction is already on-going \u2013 one in Edo and the other in Sokoto.\n\n\u201cWe expect these plants to be completed next year, which will bring our total production capacity to 17million metric tonnes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to Your Excellency coming to commission them by the first quarter of 2023,\u201d he added.\n\nRabiu pledged that BUA would continue to invest in the cement industry until Nigeria became self-sufficient and cement was made available, accessible, and affordable for all Nigerians.\n\nHe stated, \u201cMr. President, there are many reasons one can attribute to the important nature of this plant. The attendant effect of these investments in new factories goes beyond the community and the state. It extends to the region and the entire country.\n\n\u201cFrom a job creation and economic standpoint, the Sokoto plant continues to be the largest private sector employer of labour in the North-western part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAlso, by adding value to resources mined in Nigeria, Nigeria is being saved billions of US dollars in foreign exchange that would have been spent on importation, whilst also ensuring product availability.\n\n\u201cIn fact, 95 per cent of all the raw materials used in our cement manufacturing process are sourced locally. In addition to this, and our investment in social impact and CSR programmes for the community and Sokoto State at all levels, we are also committed to environmental sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe have diversified our energy sources by introducing greener alternatives \u2013 in this case, LNG \u2013 to power the kiln and 48 megawatts power plant. Our power plants are now running on 100 per cent LNG, leading to reduced carbon emissions. This is the first of its kind at any cement factory in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRabiu said this meant also that as soon as the AKK gas project came on stream, BUA would be ready to be one of the first off-takers.\n\nThis would also encourage further industrialisation within the region, open new industries and ensure greater development and prosperity for this region and the country in general.\n\n\u201cMr President, Sir, all of this will not have been possible without your support and commitment to the development of the Nigerian economy,\u201d Rabiu told Buhari.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs a proudly Nigerian company, we will do our best to continue to support those efforts. The support of the CBN and its governor in setting up this gigantic project is also worthy of mention.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have invested over a billion dollars in the past four years and we urge the CBN to continue to support industries like ours that use locally sourced raw materials to add value because, as mentioned earlier, these industries potentially save the country billions of dollars yearly and also ensure products are readily available across the length and breadth of the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Management of SPVs tops agenda\n\n*119 out of 161 awardees pay signature bonuses, 33 pending\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NURPC) yesterday moved to resolve all outstanding issues delaying the conclusion of the 2020 marginal oilfields bid process, which was conducted last year.\n\nAmong the top challenges hindering the awardees from settling down to finding \u201cfirst oil,\u201d the stakeholders agreed, was the differences among members of the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) set up by the commission to realise the objectives of the programme.\n\nWith the SPVs compelling the winners to co-own the assets, THISDAY observed that while a number of the indigenous award winners complained about non-payment of the bonuses by their partners, others complained about partial payment.\n\nThese, it was learnt, hindered the progress of the initiative, which saw the award of 57 marginal fields to 161 Nigerian entities, from which about N175 billion had been raised by the federal government so far.\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, fields were classified as marginal when they were not considered by licence holders for immediate development due to assumed marginal economics under prevailing conditions or left unattended for more than 10 years. They also included assets that leaseholders considered for farm-out due to portfolio rationalisation or those, which the president may, from time to time, identify as such.\n\nSpeaking during the meeting, the commission\u2019s Chief Executive, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, noted that the engagement with the marginal field awardees and leaseholders was for NUPRC to state the policy position on the 2020 Marginal Fields Bid Round (MFBR). Komolafe stated that this would enable successful awardees progress to field development phase in line with the PIA.\n\nHe stated that the marginal field initiative was conceived to entrench the indigenisation policy of the government in the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to him, the objective is to promote indigenous participation, increase oil and gas reserves, as well as production, encourage capital inflow, generate employment, and build local capacity in the sector.\n\nKomolafe noted that relevant leaseholders had also been invited to the forum so that they could understand their roles and responsibilities as it affects the farm-out of the fields, which he said included facilitating the achievement of first oil in a collaborative manner.\n\nIn all, he reiterated that 57 fields were identified for the 2020 bid round exercise, and a total of 665 entities expressed interest, explaining that after extensive evaluation processes as laid down in the guidelines, 161 entities emerged as potential awardees.\n\nKomolafe explained that signature bonuses for 119 awards were fully paid, nine awards were partly paid for, and 33 awards had yet to be paid for, a situation he said had resulted in various challenges inhibiting the close-out of the exercise.\n\nHe told the awardees, \u201cThe marginal field guidelines provided for 45 days for the payment of signature bonus, which has since elapsed, and we have issued a public notice to that effect as well as notified the relevant potential awardees.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to inform you that concerted efforts are being made to ensure that the 2020 MFBR exercise is completed within the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nKomolafe stated that the NUPRC management on assumption of duty set up a committee to look into issues surrounding the bid round and come up with strategies to resolve them.\n\n\u201cAnd some of these issues include the formation of SPVs, equity participation, and part payments,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, the committee has had engagements with some awardees and would continue such meetings with another set of awardees slated for next week in Lagos.\n\nThe commission, he said, through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre (ADRC) also offered an opportunity for co-awardees of marginal fields to resolve issues speedily and amicably.\n\nIn a presentation by Senior Technical Adviser to the Commission, Abel Nsa, he stated that aside indigenous participation, other objectives of the programme included promoting use of shared facilities, increasing oil and gas reserves, building technical capacity, generating employment, encouraging capital inflow, and increased production.\n\nThe NURPC noted that in 1999, two fields were awarded, 24 in 2003, one in 2006, one in 2007, two in 2010 and 57 in 2020, with 13 of the assets on land, eight on swamp and nine offshore, prior to 2020.\n\nIn the latest bid round, it stated that 665 applications were received, 540 were pre-qualified, 546 went through data prying, 450 went through data leasing, 482 submitted bids, while 161 were potentially awarded the marginal fields.\n\n\u201cIn all, 57 fields were awarded, 119 fully paid up, nine partially paid, 33 awardees failed to pay, while 247 had unsuccessful bids,\u201d the organisation indicated.\n\nOn the way forward, NURPC stated that fields where none of the awardees had made signature bonuses had been terminated, affirming that engagement with awardees and discussion on areas of conflict remain open.\n\nIn addition, the commission stated that it would take necessary measures to assist the awardees to take over the assets for development and to accelerate first oil find as soon as possible.\n\nThe NURPC team further took time out to address the concerns raised by the awardees, bordering on governance and operational matters of the SPVs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Orders refund to state\n\n\u2022It\u2019s victory for democracy, says Wike\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court yesterday declared as illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional the direct allocations made by the federal government from the federation account to fund the Nigeria Police Trust Fund. Mohammed barred the federal government from further deductions from the federation account to fund agencies not listed in the 1999 Constitution for direct allocation.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, stated that the judgement was a resounding victory for democracy.\n\nThe court, in the judgment, held that Section 161 and Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution were glaringly breached by the federal government following the direct allocation from the federation account to the Police Trust Fund.\n\nThe suit challenging the continued deductions from the federation account to fund agencies belonging to the federal government was filed by the Rivers State Government.\n\nDelivering judgement, the court held that Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution was clear and unambiguous to the effect that only the federal, states and local governments shall be allocated fund directly from the federation account.\n\nThe court also held that Section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the federal government to justify the unlawful deductions from the federation account was inconsistent with section 162 of the 1999 Constitution which recognises only the federal, states and local governments.\n\nMohammed, while upholding the suit by Rivers State against the deductions, ordered that the fund belonging to Rivers State but used to fund the Nigeria Police Trust fund by the federal government should be refunded to the state.\n\nThe judge, however, declined to extend similar order of refund to the 35 remaining states on the grounds that they were not parties in the suit, adding that Rivers State, as the plaintiff in this matter, did not file it on behalf of others.\n\nThe court upheld all arguments of Joseph Daudu, who stood for Rivers State, that where the provisions of the 1999 Constitution are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their ordinary meanings.\n\nMohammed also agreed with Daudu that the federal government was completely wrong in the interpretation given to section 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act to the effect that the Nigerian Police was established for the federal government alone and as such the funding should solely be on the shoulders of the federal government.\n\nRivers State in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/511/2020 and instituted on its behalf by former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Daudu, had challenged the decision of the federal government to allocate funds directly from the federation account to fund some of its agencies, stating that the decision violates section 162 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe Rivers State government also stated that the actions of the federal government deprived it substantial revenue from the federation account and, therefore, prayed the court to nullify the allocation from the federation account.\n\nThe plaintiff also claimed that the levies imposed on companies operating in Nigeria by the federal government, be paid directly to the Nigeria Police Force Trust Fund, instead of the federation account was also illegal.\n\nThe judge agreed with the plaintiff that under the relevant laws, such levies were supposed to be paid directly to the federation account and not to any federal government agencies.\n\nThe judge held, \u201cI have carefully perused the issues raised by the plaintiff and I agree that no other person or entity is permitted to benefit direct fund allocation from the federation account.\n\n\u201cSection 4 of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act 2019 relied upon by the defendant to make direct fund allocation from the Federation Account is untenable as it runs contrary to section 162 (3) of the 1999 Constitution, which expressly stated that the federal government, state governments and local governments shall derive direct fund allocation from the federation account.\u201d\n\nDefendant in the matter were the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF); Accountant General of the Federation; Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission and Minister of Finance.\n\nHowever only the Attorney General of the Federation filled processes to defend the federal government\u2019s action.\n\nThe AGF had in his preliminary objection asked the Federal High Court to decline jurisdiction in the matter on the ground that such suit ought to be filed directly at the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the preliminary objection was dismissed by Mohammed on the ground that it was misplaced and absurd.\n\nMeanwhile, Wike hailed the ruling, noting that the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Act, which the federal government relied on deduct funds from the Federation Account was in contravention of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cI have always told people, it is not whether you must win or not, but it is a matter of when you see issues that you think are in contravention of our constitution and other laws, there is nothing wrong for you to challenge it, so that the right thing can be done.\n\n\u201cAfter all, if the money is given back to us, we can still on our own say police, we want to support you with this. But not the federal government arbitrarily deducting our money from the federation account and putting it to Police Trust Fund. I don\u2019t think that, that is right and I thank God that today the court has made a clear pronouncement on it.\u201d\n\nThe governor acknowledged that though the National Assembly was constitutionally empowered to enact laws, in enacting the Police Trust Fund Act, they went beyond their powers by contravening the provisions of the constitution.\n\nSpeaking further on the order of the court that the Rivers State government should be refunded the money deducted from its share to fund the police, Wike said the order would put an end to impunity.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cWe are happy that the court has said that they should refund us all the money deducted and, luckily, the principal parties, Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission, the Accountant General, Attorney General Office, they are all involved in the case.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Rivers State, but it is about the impunity, it is about the violation of the constitution, as if anybody can wake up one early morning and just decide to do one or two things, which is wrong. And I am happy that the decision we took, we are not wrong and I thank my legal team.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022To send supplementary appropriation to National Assembly\n\n\u2022Mandates finance ministry to reconcile payment with NNPC\n\n\u2022NLC knocks govt over 18-month timeline\n\n\u2022 IPMAN wants dilapidated refineries fixed\n\n\u2022Fayemi: Only 8 states benefiting from subsidy\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha in Abuja; Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\nA day after the federal government announced its plan to delay implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and retain payment of petrol subsidy for 18 months, the government yesterday approved N3 trillion for the new subsidy regime. The Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the sum at its weekly meeting in Abuja.\n\nThe N3 trillion now budgeted to sustain the payment of subsidy in 2022 alone, amounts to 17.5 per cent of the total of N17.126 trillion 2022 budget that was signed into law on the last day of 2021. Already, the approved 2022 budget has a deficit of N6.39 trillion, which is 37 per cent of the N17.126 trillion. This is a clear indication that the government may borrow more this year than it had earlier projected.\n\nThe N3 trillion approved by FEC is 55 per cent and 43 per cent of the capital component and recurrent expenditure of the 2022 budget, respectively.\n\nImplementation of the PIA, which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy, was initially meant to commence in February 2022, but it was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threat of protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the removal of subsidy was suspended on Monday.\n\nBut NLC, Lagos chapter, yesterday criticised the federal government\u2019s decision to recommend an 18-month extension of the PIA to the National Assembly.\n\nOn its part, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) urged the federal government to introduce palliatives to cushion the effect of subsidy withdrawal, irrespective of the postponement of the policy, as well as fix all the country\u2019s refineries.\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said only about eight states were presently benefitting directly from petrol subsidy. Fayemi said this at a joint meeting between the state governors, NLC, and TUC over the fuel subsidy withdrawal.\n\nFEC yesterday mandated the Finance, Budget and National Planning Ministry to reconcile the fuel subsidy budget with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, which prepared the estimate.\n\nThe council meeting presided by President Muhammadu Buhari also okayed the preparation of the 2022 Supplementary Budget, which would include the repeal of Clauses 10 and 11 of the Appropriation Act as well as incorporation of N103 billion removed by the lawmakers from the initial budget estimates, for submission to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe decisions reached at the virtual FEC meeting were made public by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who briefed newsmen after the meeting.\n\nAhmed said a memo in respect of the additional funding provisions to enable government meet the incremental fuel subsidy request in the 2022 budget was presented for the council\u2019s consideration.\n\nShe said only N443 billion had been provided for in the 2022 budget to accommodate subsidy from January to June, but taking the prevailing economic realities, both locally and globally, into consideration, FEC proposed a year-long provision for the subsidy.\n\nAhmed said the request was considered by the council, which directed the ministry to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget.\n\nThe minister explained, \u201cYou would recall that in the 2022 budget, as appropriated, we have made a provision of N443 billion for subsidy for January to June. Having taken into account the current realities: increased hardship in the population, heightened inflation, and also that the measures that needed to be taken to enable a smoother exit from the fuel subsidy are not yet in place, it was agreed by Council that it is desirable to exit fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC has presented to the ministry a request for N3 trillion as fuel subsidy for 2022. What this means is that we have to make an incremental provision of N2.557 trillion to be able to meet the subsidy requirement, which is averaging about N270 billion per month.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the actual under-recovery that has been charged to the federation was N1.2 trillion, which means an average of N100 billion, but in 2022, because of the increased crude oil price per barrel in the global market, now at $80 per barrel, and also because an NNPC\u2019s assessment is that the country is consuming 65.7 million litres per day, now we\u2019ll end up with incremental cost of N3 trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this has been considered by Council and we\u2019ve also been asked to approach the National Assembly for an amendment to the fiscal framework as well as the budget, to also further discuss with NNPC on how to make provisions for this and how to rationalise this expenditure.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that her ministry had been directed to engage the NNPC with the possibility of bringing down the subsidy estimate.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe\u2019re going to engage NNPC to further interrogate the request that they presented with a view of trying to see how we can scale it down so that the country is not incurring N3 trillion for a fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe agreed with the view of governors, that there is a need to scale down on the size. So even as government is not immediately removing the fuel subsidy, we have to make sure that what the nation is incurring is efficient, and that it is real cost that has been consumed by the country.\u201d\n\nAhmed stated that the government would fund the N3 trillion subsidy regime through outstanding debts owed it by NNPC, which were being sorted out through on-going financial reconciliations with the company.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe have several reconciliations with NNPC, which is owing, in some cases, the government. So we want to be able to settle some of the subsidy costs through this reconciliation process.\n\n\u201cWhen we are done with that, whatever is left that we are not able to apply to what NNPC is owing the federation will not be increasing the deficit. And that means increased domestic borrowing. But we haven\u2019t finished with the issue of reconciliation.\u201d\n\nAhmed further disclosed that FEC approved the 2022 Supplementary Budget to take care of areas that were overlooked by the National Assembly in approving the Appropriation Bill. She said FEC approved amendments to parts of the 2022 budget, which had initially been adjusted by the National Assembly during its legislative deliberations on the budget proposal submitted to it by the president in 2021.\n\nAccording to her, the approved amendment to be transmitted to the National Assembly will request to repeal clauses 10 and 11 concerning the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) operations in the 2022 budget and restore the N103 billion the lawmakers had removed.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe second memo we presented to Council today has to do with a request for approval of the 2022 Appropriation Amendment. If you recall, when the president signed the 2022 appropriation into law on the 31st of December, he raised some concerns that he had in some of the provisions in the budget and had indicated that he will be submitting an amendment proposal to the National Assembly for them to effect improvements in what has been done to the budget.\n\n\u201cSo, today Council took that amendment proposal and I just want to report that part of the requests that Council has approved today is for the National Assembly to repeal clauses 10 and 11. Clause 10 is referring to a provision that has been made that will enable the EFCC and NFIU be able to take 10 per cent of whatever collections that they recover.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for that to be repealed because this is in direct contrast to the Acts of these two agencies and also it is in contravention of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and the Finance Act 2021.\n\n\u201cClause 11, on the other hand, is a provision that has been made that says that the Nigeria embassies and missions are now authorised by this Appropriation Act to expend funds allocated to them under Capital Components without the need to seek approval of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This, again, Council agreed, is inconsistent with financial regulations and also inconsistent with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act. So, we are asking for this to be repealed.\n\n\u201cCouncil also approved that some of the changes that were made in the Appropriation Act, totalling N103 billion, should be restored and examples of these are N22 billion that was provided for sinking fund to mature bonds that will be ready for payment in 2022 in the Nigerian domestic market, and also N12 billion for counterpart funding that is required for the various rail projects, and N189 million to be adjusted also in the budgets of the Ministry of Transport, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, and the Head of Service.\n\n\u201cThese are projects that are provided in these ministries that are completely unrelated to their mandate, so implementation will be a problem. Also, N5 billion to be restored for non-regular allowances of the Nigerian Navy, N15 billion to be restored for the regular allowances of the police formations and police commands and several others that Council looked at in detail.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s a detailed schedule of this N103 billion that Mr. President will be formally conveying to the National Assembly to restore the adjustments that were made.\u201d\n\nAhmed also disclosed that FEC ratified an instrument on diplomatic relations between Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis has to do with the confirmation of ratification of Customs Mutual Administrative Assistance Agreement between South Africa and Nigeria and the purpose for us is for the customs law in the respective territories to be properly observed to prevent and also enhance investigation and to combat customs offenses and to afford each country mutual assistance in cases concerning the delivery of documents regarding the application of customs laws in two countries.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this for us is cooperation between Nigeria and South Africa, as it has become even more important now with the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement. It will also help to increase trade relations between the two countries and facilitate exchange of information as well as strengthen our bi-national cooperation.\u201d\n\nNLC Knocks FG for Proposing 18 Months Extension\n\nNLC said the federal government was only postponing the evil day. Chairperson of NLC, Lagos Chapter, Agnes Sessi, spoke yesterday on \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a programme on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers. Sessi said government had been very deceitful, as it had never fulfilled its promises to Nigerians regarding the maintenance of the refineries.\n\nShe stated that successive governments had deceived the populace into believing that they had to subsidise petrol.\n\nSessi said, \u201cWe need a concerted effort to fight the problem of corruption in our society, we thought it could be better during this administration, but it is getting worse. Everybody needs to speak and kill the slogan, which says if you cannot beat them, you join them.\n\n\u201cWe are not supposed to join them because successive governments have been unable to do the turnaround maintenance, despite the huge amount of money they have spent.\u201d\n\nDefending accusations that the NLC was engaged in smuggling of petrol, Sessi insisted it was simply blackmail because they chose not to be a part of the evil plans.\n\nShe advised that people should stop shifting the blame to labour, saying the unions are only a fraction of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because government has seen the kind of mobilisation and that we were serious, that is why they made a U-turn and reversed their decision that would have caused problems and pushed Nigerians to the highest level of economic downturn,\u201d Sessi concluded.\n\nOn his part, the Director General (DG) of Micheal Imodu Institute of Labour Studies, Issa Aremu, commended the leadership of NLC for remaining focused and for keeping to the tradition of the movement of engaging policies.\n\nAccording to Aremu, \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this process so I know what it takes to mobilise and demobilise. I am happy that inclusive issues of development are up for discussions.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cI am happy that we are all on the same page and it can be business as usual within the petroleum downstream sector.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long drawn issue and I think additional 18 months cannot be too long for us to look at all the issues as we are looking at nation building and not the regime. We shouldn\u2019t be a debating but functional society.\u201d\n\nHe called on the relevant stakeholders to stop hoarding petroleum products while the transition process is being managed.\n\nThe director general insisted that labour should be a little more balanced, saying the government had retained jobs and paid salaries as and when due.\n\nIPMAN Wants Dilapidated Refineries Fixed\n\nNational Operations Controller, IPMAN, Mike Osatuyi, reiterated their support for the federal government in whatever decisions they made. Osatuyi noted that the 18 months suspension would give the government the avenue to put in palliatives and support for Nigerians.\n\nOsatuyi also clarified the notion about the group being government agents, stating that they are an association of businessmen who condemn subsidy.\n\nIPMAN, in a statement, appealed to the federal government to give priority to the revitalisation of the four refineries in the country ahead of the removal of the subsidy on petroleum products.\n\nPresident of IPMAN, Alhaji Debo Ahmed, in the statement, also appealed to the federal government to ensure the availability of petroleum products to the NNPC depots across the country. He stated that selective supply to private depots was, \u201cmaking it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\u201d\n\nThe IPMAN president restated his association\u2019s demand for payment of outstanding Bridging Claims owed marketers by the defunct Petroleum Equalisation Fund, now operating under the name, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe leadership of IPMAN commends the federal government for the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy. We reiterate our position that the four nations\u2019 refineries be repaired and allowed to function optimally before the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe also use this opportunity to call on the federal government to resume the supply of petroleum products to NNPC depots nationwide as against the selective supply to private depots, making it impossible for the product to be sold at the government upper price band.\n\n\u201cOur huge funds are tied up with PPMC Ltd, a subsidiary of NNPC, where members pay for NNPC products supplied to their depots. We are equally pleading that marketers transportation claims be paid to allow members remain afloat in business.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fayemi told the governors\u2019 meeting with NLC and TUC that only about eight states benefitted from the federal government\u2019s fuel subsidy.\n\nParticipants at the meeting called on the federal government to constitute a forensic examination on the activities of the NNPC. They alleged that the national oil company was bandying falsehood in terms of the amount being spent on petrol subsidy.\n\nThe meeting, which was held at the NGF secretariat, Abuja, brokered a partnership between the NGF and labour.\n\nDelivering his opening remarks at the meeting, Fayemi argued that the country\u2019s economy was at a precipice and, \u201cit has become necessary for the two groups to carefully verify all of NNPC\u2019s estimates to ensure that whatever action is taken on subsidy, it would be the people that get direct benefits and not a few wealthy individuals and their cronies in the country.\u201d\n\nFayemi told the labour leaders that subsidy removal had remained an on-gong conversation, not just among governors, but also the country at large.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor stated that, \u201cThere are raging questions of accountability associated with subsidy removal in the country and observed that the NGF and the NLC can jointly work together to proffer solutions that heal the economy and provide succour to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe NGF chairman had led to the meeting the delegation of governors, which included Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State, who is also chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, and Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State. He stressed that all the countries surrounding Nigeria, including Niger, Mali, Cameroun and Ghana, had their fuel pump price in dollar equivalent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The N3 trillion now budgeted to sustain the payment of subsidy in 2022 alone, amounts to 17.5 per cent of the total of N17.126 trillion 2022 budget that was signed into law on the last day of 2021.\nAlready, the approved 2022 budget has a deficit of N6.39 trillion, which is 37 per cent of the N17.126 trillion.\nFayemi said this at a joint meeting between the state governors, NLC, and TUC over the fuel subsidy withdrawal.\nFEC yesterday mandated the Finance, Budget and National Planning Ministry to reconcile the fuel subsidy budget with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, which prepared the estimate.\nAhmed said a memo in respect of the additional funding provisions to enable government meet the incremental fuel subsidy request in the 2022 budget was presented for the council\u2019s consideration.",

          "text": "The Dowen College Parents\u2019 Forum in Lagos State has demanded an overhaul of the school management and hostel teachers as well as the installation of Closed Circuit Television cameras in the school as the death of 12-year-old student, Sylvester Oromoni, continues to gain prominence nationwide.\n\nThe parents\u2019 forum, which condemned the death of the student, said a candle light procession would be held for him on Wednesday.\n\nIn a release obtained by SaharaReporters on Tuesday and signed by Aituaz Kola-Oladejo, Waheed Adeoye, Oluwaseun Bolanle Ajila and Kingsley Kema Agu, the parents stated that what happened to Sylvester \u201ccould have happened to any other child in the school.\u201d\n\nThe forum said, \u201cDowen College Parents are startled and deeply saddened by the unfortunate incident that led to the death of Sylvester Oromoni. Our hearts go out to the family of the deceased and pray that God gives them the strength to bear the irreparable loss.\n\n\u201cAs parents of Dowen college students, we are still in shock and could not come to terms with this incident and the accounts so far provided by the school,students, and the media.\n\n\u201cWe urge the school management team and other stakeholders (students and parents directly or indirectly mentioned) to fully cooperate with the authority in the ongoing investigation. While we would have loved to bring Sylvester back if humanly possible, unravelling the cause of Sylvester\u2019s death and bringing whoever was responsible or might have contributed in whatever way to book,will not only bring this unfortunate incident to a closure for the family, but this will also serve as a deterrent to others in all schools in Nigeria.

          "title": "Old Students Lament Delay In Getting Certificates From Ibadan Polytechnic",
          "text": "Some graduates of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, Oyo State, have decried the delay in the issuance of certificates by the institution despite having graduated some years back.\n\nThe graduates, particularly Ordinary National Diploma holders, told SaharaReporters that they finished from the institution in 2018 and had done the necessary clearance.\n\n\n\nAccording to them, their names had even appeared on the convocation list which shows that all registrations had been duly completed.\n\nHowever, they said it has been tough obtaining the certificates and transcripts from the institution to further their studies in other schools.\n\nOne of them, who graduated in 2018, said as efforts to further his studies were on, he applied for the statement of result the same year but this was only successful after two years.\n\nIn 2020, he got the statement of result, which he has since used in some applications to institutions both in Nigeria and abroad.\n\nUpon acceptance, he had been required to get the original copy of his certificate and transcript from the polytechnic, which he has applied for since November, 2021.\n\nHowever, till now, nothing has been done and according to him, he has spent not less than N100, 000 for the processing.\n\nHe said, \u201dI completed my National Diploma in Mechatronics since 2018 and the school did not release my statement of the result until 2020. I have since applied for further studies but I need my certificate and transcript.\n\n\u201cI applied for the certificate in November 2021, I paid all required fees and charges for the release of the certificate, up till now there is no green light to get the certificate soon.\n\n\u201cAll the courses I took while at the polytechnic were duly registered and throughout my stay at the poly, I never had any issue of missing results. I had no problem, my name was always on the score sheet and as a matter of fact, my name was on the graduating list. Even in the convocation list, my name was there.\n\n\u201dI got a statement of result already but now I needed to apply for the certificate so I can further my studies. Normally, after the statement of result, they said it will take like one year for the certificate to be ready. I got the notification of the result in 2020 and in November 2021, I had to apply for the certificate and I was told to come back after a month but since then up until now, the certificate is not ready.\u201d\n\nAnother affected graduate said, \u201dI have also been trying to process my certificate from the school and I have a contact person there but what he keeps telling me is that the certificate is not ready.\n\n\u201cI graduated two years ago, I had no problem, school fees was paid up to date, clearance done, all the levies were already sorted but it has been so difficult to get a statement of result. I wonder how long it will take to finally get the certificates. Some of my colleagues simply started all over again because they couldn't just deal with waiting. They had to start with their SSCE certificates from scratch, like they've never attended a higher institution before.\u201d\n\nAnother aggrieved person said he already gained admission to both local and foreign institutions several times but have had to forfeit such over inability to get the transcript and certificate from the polytechnic.\n\nHe said, \u201cI already gained admission in institutions in Nigeria and abroad but was unable to proceed, I was home for two years because the statement of result was not ready. Okay, after we crossed the hurdle, I had to go for Industrial training but now that other opportunities have come up, my certificate is required. I applied for certificate again and paid close to N100, 000 as charges to get the certificate and transcript.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, they've not even started processing my transcript. I requested for my transcript because I needed it for admissions but they have not been started processing it yet. Another problem with the transcript is that we cannot process it online. I had to go to school to submit files here and there. I envisage another delay for maybe another one year and I hope not.\n\n\u201cOver two months now, the certificate is not ready and imagine transcript that is part of the prerequisite for processing admission in some other places is also not ready. These people are in the educational sector, they know the right thing and they know there are deadlines. If they delay further, they want all our efforts, money and all to be wasted.\n\n\u201dThe problem is immediately we graduated in 2018, the school wiped off our profile from the database (portal) so it's even difficult to track the progress of the transcript or certificate. There is no means for students to apply for transcripts online. The issue is, some people in school have the authority to handle such things, they have a special portal for it.\n\n\u201dNormally, we are supposed to pay on our portal but they have removed our details from the portal. In fact, the first time I went to school for the transcript, I tried to log in to my profile on the website, I couldn't. When I went to the cyber cafe, I was told they wiped off our profile. They designated some cyber cafes within the school to access the portal.\u201d\n\nThis comes amid a backlash on higher institutions in Nigeria delaying issuiance of certificates and transcripts to graduates who have been duly cleared.\n\nSome months ago, a graduate of The Polytechnic Ibadan, lamented the failure of the institution\u2019s authorities to provide his academic transcripts for the past two years since he finished his Higher National Diploma.\n\nThe source, who graduated in 2019, revealed that many graduates of the school could not proceed to pursue other academic programmes in other schools when there were no transcripts to tender.\n\nHe told SaharaReporters at the time that he was already having difficulty in his place of work over the transcript.\n\nAlso in 2020, another Nigerian graduate, Olanrewaju Soyinka, said the delay in issuance of certificate at Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Abeokuta, Ogun State, served as a major cause of setback for him in his application for a postgraduate programme abroad.\n\nReply allReplyForward",

          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "He built TikTok's strategy in Africa, now he's building Kippa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nTikTok made huge waves when it announced its sponsorship of the African Cup of Nations, the continent\u2019s biggest football tournament. Kennedy Ekezie-Joseph who helped lead TikTok\u2019s entry into Africa, was no longer with the company for that moment of triumph. Instead, he was grinding away at a new startup. Big mistake? Maybe not.\n\nLeaving a budding career at social networking behemoth that has big ambitions on your home continent, to launch a startup, sounds like a suicidal move. But for Ekezie-Joseph, 23, who was part of a small group that led TikTok\u2019s foray into Africa and was well-positioned to benefit from the company\u2019s continental ambitions, it actually wasn\u2019t. That much became clear when his startup attracted record seed funding.\n\nEkezie-Joseph\u2019s startup, Kippa, is a bookkeeping and finance app that he founded with Duke Ekezie (his brother) and Jephthah Uche in February 2021. It has had a meteoric trajectory since its launch in June.\n\nIn November, the startup hauled in $3.2 million in pre-seed funding, arguably one of the largest early-stage fund-raises in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile phone and Whatsapp-friendly, Kippa targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SME\u2019s) providing them with free, easy-to-use accounting software. Kippa then looks at potential financing opportunities and makes revenue by taking commission fees and earning interest by lending companies working capital.\n\nTo date, more than a billion dollars in transactions have been recorded by the platform, according to the founders.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria today, there are 47 million SMEs, according to SMED Analyst statistics out there. About 280,000 merchants out of that number, have used the product. And our goal is over the next five to 10 years to capture as much of that number as possible, by building out new features, by launching new product lines,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said in an interview with bird.\n\nAs a child, Ekezie-Joseph saw first-hand how the absence of judicious record-keeping could impact fragile and shock-prone micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n\u201cMy dad had a small business around when I was born, which he lost. And so for me, it really means a lot to build for a segment that I feel very intimately familiar with,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nF-R: Duke, Japhthah, and Kennedy, co-founders of Kippa\n\nKippa (a play on book\u201dkeeper\u201d) is a bookkeeping mobile app that allows small business owners to keep track of their daily income and expense transactions, issue invoices, provide receipts to their customers and create marketing materials like business cards.\n\nThe app also keeps track of debtors who owe the subscriber companies money.\n\nWhen he launched Kippa, Ekezie-Joseph knew from personal experience that he was addressing an existential threat to businesses. This gave him and his team confidence.\n\nTrue to their projection, Kippa was an instant hit at launch, striking a chord with thousands of SMEs in Nigeria, underlining the opportunities and the demand for this particular service.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, SMEs have been laggers when it comes to the adoption of digital technology. What we\u2019ve seen is digital technology has changed very many other industries \u2013 healthcare, transport \u2013 but the way businesses are run and the overall back-office operations are still very manual, they\u2019ve really not changed since the 60s,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re trying to do here is unite the tailwind of the deep penetration of the internet that is continuing to grow across the continent and the smartphone penetration. So by 2025, Nigeria alone will contribute 4 per cent of total new smartphone users in the world. And we think that\u2019s such an exciting deal in that, companies like us are building on the back of to provide tools that business owners can use on these devices that they have.\u201d\n\nKennedy Ekezie-Joseph presented with a Queen\u2019s Young Leaders Award in 2018 for his work in promoting women\u2019s rights in the areas of female genital mutilation (FGM), domestic abuse and forced child marriage and access to education for girls.\n\nEkezie-Joseph and his team are now planning another round of fundraising to scale the company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cSo we will be talking to investors over the next couple of months. And one of the big things we believe in is building relationships early and taking time to identify the right partners to work with. So if we do meet investors who are the right fit, we\u2019ll be able to work with them,\u201d he said.\n\nEkezie-Joseph was an early recipient of the prestigious Yenching Scholarship, a masters program at the elite Peking University in Beijing, China.\n\nA top Nigerian debater while still at college, as a 16-year-old college freshman, he had already begun using his voice to change his community, founding a social enterprise that worked to end the practice of female genital mutilation in communities and increase access to education for young girls.\n\nWith two TEDx talks under his belt, a Barack Obama Young African Leaders Fellowship and a Resolution Fellowship and numerous recognitions and accolades, Ekezie-Joseph has a track record of success despite his young age.\n\nA master\u2019s degree from an elite academy at Beijing\u2019s top research university must have made Ekezie-Joseph a shoo-in at TikTok, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance. He was part of the early expansion of TikTok into Africa. But the experience at a university that has given rise to some of the world\u2019s greatest tech companies and spawned dozens of top global entrepreneurs, may have also given him bigger ambitions.\n\n\u201cI was the first line here and had the team to lead our acquisition and growth for the company\u2019s expansions. Africa? We had a couple thousand users of the product, then. And you know, we\u2019ve gone from then, 2018, to today being the third-most-used social app in Africa, with tens of millions of users,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging the economic impact of COVID-19 on the continent, Ekezie-Joseph noted that it had helped fuel the growth of the tech industry and internet adoption in Africa.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time many merchants understood that they could do business online. That was the first time many consumers understood that they could transact with merchants online. So it almost helped us leapfrog the absence of trust around digital tools. And that\u2019s been super helpful. And more and more people are doing business online now. So that is very significant for our growth as a business,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the early conversion of bookkeepers and small business owners, Ekezie-Joseph is the first to admit that there are plenty of hurdles ahead.\n\n\u201cTo bring the right people in the door, bring the most experienced people in the industry and have them around the table working with us pursuing the mission. And so that means bringing regulators on board, you know, people will have experience engaging with them, and industry veterans. So that is a very big one for us,\u201d he said in an interview with the bird story agency.\n\n\u02dc\u201dThe second thing is also executing on our roadmap\u2026the way we think about it last year, we built a really solid product and validated the need for it in the market. And this is truly the year we build processes around that and leverage that and we continue to build at breakneck speed for all users and establish our place in the market.\u201d\n\nSo have there been misgivings over leaving TikTok?\n\n\u201cNo! The plan was always to eventually move back to Nigeria and build a startup and the onset of the pandemic in China, gave me the perfect reason to make the move back and take the leap,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nShare this article",

Tony Iju Nwabunike stated this in Lagos recently during a press briefing to celebrate the four years of his executives on the leadership of the foremost freight forwarding association in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPursuing bigger revenue and failing to strengthen trade results in greater losses to the economy as investments are either threatened, reduced or made non existent.\u201d\n\nHe also said that totality of customs efforts deployed into revenue pursuit reduces the service\u2019s productivity in many ways\u201d, Nwabunike stated.\n\nWhile appealing President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Finance not to sign the proposed $3.1 billion the customs modernisation contract, Nwabunike said that it would tie down the NCS to a 20 year debt repayment programme that is not necessary for the country which is already contending with huge foreign and domistic debts that are gulping over 85 per cent of the nation\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nNwabunike said: \u201cWe want to also advise the Federal Government to be careful before signing into the $3.1 billion Customs Modernisation Project which we heard, will run for 20 years.\n\nWe urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the Finance Minister to avoid assenting to the deal, saying \u201cNigeria is already in serious debts and customs being a strategic non-oil revenue earner for government shouldn\u2019t be tied to another long term debt repayment for two decades.\n\n\u201cOn this, we call on the National Assembly to take a closer look at the details and ensure that the Federal Ministry of Finance, Nigeria Customs Service and all parties involved observe due diligence that won\u2019t entrap the country in another long term debt repayment for 20 years and maybe for lesser value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for its recent inauguration of an expanded partnership committee on blue economy chaired by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, saying its a very bold step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cFor us, this shows more commitment by the Buhari administration to maritime matters. We urge the committee to go beyond conference room talk and paperwork to addressing real challenges militating against full harvesting of our marine environment benefits in a sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nNwabunike also called on Federal Government to ensure that it includes the ANLCA in some of its committees, saying \u201cAs a body of Customs Brokers, practitioners and investors,\u201d they have vast experience in trade matters\u201d.\n\n...",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Sokoto inaugurated a new three million metric tonnes per annum BUA Cement Sokoto Line 4 Factory, expressing delight that the Federal Government\u2019s policies on economic diversification, job creation and creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, were working.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the plant, described as the largest private sector employer of labour in the North-Western part of Nigeria, the President in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, pledged that his administration would continue to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of huge reserves of resources in different parts of the country.\n\nThe President recounted that in 1985 as the then Head of State, he was at the same location to commission the second line of the facility.\n\n\u201dToday, almost thirty-seven years later, to commission the fourth line is a very special day for me personally.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dAs you all know, one of the key economic pillars of our administration has been to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. This is necessary for job creation and indeed, for our economy and national security.\n\n\u201dIn the past few weeks, I visited Ogun and Kaduna States where I observed many private sector investments in action. And today, I am here in Sokoto to commission this multi-billion Naira project.\n\n\u201dIt is therefore very clear for all to see that our policies are working. Progress is gradually being made in all parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President thanked the Founder of BUA Cement, Abdul Samad Rabiu and the entire team for the great work they are doing in supporting the government\u2019s economic diversification and job creation agenda.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that the company, which has completed four new cement plants of similar capacity in the last five years in different parts of the country and is set to complete two more plants soon, had shown through these investments that they believe in Nigeria and its potential.\n\nCommending BUA and other entrepreneurs for making Nigeria self-sufficient in cement and a net exporter of the strategic product, the President said: \u201dI am pleased that through these investments, BUA Cement has created employment opportunities for our citizens. Today, BUA is the largest employer of labour in the North-West region.\n\n\u201dI always remind Nigerians that every region, indeed every State, in Nigeria sits on huge reserves of resources. For example, in this area, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara can boast of rice production, gold and other precious metals development and of course, heavy industries like cement manufacturing.\n\n\u201dAs a Government, we introduced policies and mechanisms to support such investments in a legal, ethical and inclusive manner.\n\n\u201dFor example, we have the National Food Security Council on Food Security Matters and the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative to develop local artisanal gold mining and ensure health and safety of mining workers and protect the environment.\n\n\u201dWe remain prepared to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of these opportunities through value addition so as to take advantage of the huge market here, as well as in the greater African region and the world at large.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHighlighting other efforts to bring even development to all parts of the country, the President expressed confidence that the Ajaokuta\u2013Kaduna\u2013Kano (AKK) gas project, when completed, will bring gas for domestic and industrial purposes from the South South region to the South East, North Central and North West Geopolitical zones.\n\nHe said the AKK project would significantly reduce cost of operations for industries in the regions.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to reassure Nigerians that his government would continue to invest heavily in roads and rails to ease movement of people, goods and services, with a view to facilitating trade while lowering logistics costs associated with the inefficiencies of bad roads and bridges.\n\nOn security, President Buhari reiterated his commitment to bring peace and stability to all parts of Nigeria, listing a raft of measures undertaken by this administration to ensure that normalcy returns to the country.\n\n\u201dWe continue to recruit and equip security personnel while expanding our social investment programs to support the youth and some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n\n\u201dYou should all be reassured that we will win this battle against the criminal elements looking to destabilize our nation by hindering the progress of our economy.\n\n\u201dI want to now call on all entrepreneurs and businesses to emulate what is being done here.\n\n\u201dThe task of nation building requires all hands to be on deck. The public and private sectors must collaborate if we are to achieve our aim of collective peace and prosperity across the entire nation.\u201d\n\nAbdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman, BUA Cement, who commended the President for creating the enabling environment for businesses to thrive, acknowledged the support of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and its Governor in setting up the gigantic project.\n\nHe announced that, \u201dso far, we have invested over a billion dollars in the past four years and we urge the CBN to continue to support industries like ours that use locally sourced raw materials to add value.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that BUA would continue to invest more in the cement industry until Nigeria is self-sufficient and the commodity is made available, accessible, and affordable for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dIn the past 6 years, we have completed 4 plants \u2013 two in Obu, Edo State and two in Sokoto (of which this Sokoto line 4 is the fourth) with BUA\u2019s total production capacity now standing at 11.5million tonnes with the completion of this plant.\n\n\u201dNext year, we intend to complete the construction of two new plants of 3 million metric tonnes each for which construction is ongoing \u2013 one in Edo and the other, here in Sokoto,\u201d Rabiu said.\n\nRabiu added that he looked forward to President Buhari commissioning the plants next year which will bring total production capacity to 17.5million metric tonnes.",

Wale settled for the Nigeria Postal Service, NIPOST, to do the job. He got a small vehicle and conveyed the items which include a refrigerator, mattresses, cooking pots, gas cooker and cylinder among others to the NIPOST Head Office in Katsina.\n\nNIPOST slammed him with a bill of N25, 000 with a firm promise to deliver the listed items from Katsina to Osogbo in Osun State within the time frame of two weeks at most. The transaction was initiated on October 8, 2021. But three months after, to the chagrin and bewilderment of the customer, NIPOST not only failed to deliver the items but are also at a loss as to where the items are. They do not know the location of the items many months after moving them from Katsina NIPOST Office. While the owner of the goods has not suspected Wale of any foul play and is sure he did his best, the recipient of the items, the elder sister to the owner of the items has been on his neck.\n\nWhile speaking with Arewa Voice, Wale said: \u201cThe owner of the goods is someone that knows me to a large extent; if not he would have accused me of foul play. However, the elder sister who was billed to receive the items in Osogbo is agitated. I have been trying to persuade and calm her down from time to time. I have been to their office countless times to ask them where exactly my goods are and how soon they will resolve the issue but they can\u2019t tell. The last time I went there, I threatened to initiate a legal action against them but they appealed to me to exercise more patience. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\n\u201cI even went online to search for their customer care contact or head office phone line to complain to but all the numbers I saw there are not functional. They are either switched off, not assigned, unavailable or unreachable. I also sent mails to the different email address I found on the internet but I did not receive any response till now.\u201d\n\nArewa Voice investigations at the Katsina NIPOST Office reveal that the ordeal is a general challenge faced by customers who use NIPOST to deliver items from the North to the southern part of the country. According to Husaini Bello, the Counter Manager, NIPOST Katsina, \u201cThis cargo issue is not peculiar to Wale\u2019s items. It is a general problem. Already we have done our own here. NIPOST has its own routing channels. Items from Katsina don\u2019t go direct to Osogbo or any other place. We either send such item to Funtua or Zaria because there is a stationed cargo there attached to Katsina zone which is under Kaduna zone. When we pack our load there, they normally send a truck from our central zone, Abuja, through Dutse. So, it is the responsibility of Abuja the main central latitude to take loads from Abuja to other parts of the country not ours.\u201d\n\nOn way out of the quagmire, Husaini said it will take the Kaduna Zonal Manager to ascertain the whereabouts of the items through NIPOST tracking platform. But about two months since he was reached, the whereabouts of the items remain unknown, Arewa Voice checks revealed. The counter manager maintained that it was only the Kaduna Zonal Manager who was in the best position to make the inquiries to ascertain where exactly the items may be through a platform where general complaints, problems, inquiries are normally reported.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated a new three million metric tonnes per annum BUA Cement Sokoto Line 4 Factory in Sokoto, expressing delight that the federal government\u2019s policies on economic diversification, job creation and an enabling environment for businesses to thrive were working.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at the inauguration of the plant described as the largest private sector employer of labour in the North-west part of Nigeria, the president pledged that his administration would continue to support serious investors to set up businesses that would take advantage of huge reserves of resources in different parts of the country.\n\nHe recalled that in 1985 as the then Head of State, he was at the same location to commission the 2nd line of the facility.\n\n\u201dToday, almost thirty-seven years later, to commission the fourth line is a very special day for me personally\n\n\u201dAs you all know, one of the key economic pillars of our administration has been to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. This is necessary for job creation and indeed, for our economy and national security.\n\n\u201dIn the past few weeks, I visited Ogun and Kaduna States where I observed many private sector investments in action. And today, I am here in Sokoto to commission this multi-billion Naira project.\n\n\u201dIt is therefore very clear for all to see that our policies are working. Progress is gradually being made in all parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked the Founder of BUA Cement, Abdul Samad Rabiu and the entire team for the great work they were doing in supporting the government\u2019s economic diversification and job creation agenda.\n\nHe said the company, which has completed four new cement plants of similar capacity in the last five years in different parts of the country and set to complete two more plants soon, had shown through these investments that they believed in Nigeria and its potential.\n\nCommending BUA and other entrepreneurs for making Nigeria self-sufficient in cement and a net exporter of the strategic product, the president said: \u201dI am pleased that through these investments, BUA Cement has created employment opportunities for our citizens. Today, BUA is the largest employer of labour in the North-West region.\n\n\u201dI always remind Nigerians that every region, indeed every State in Nigeria, sits on huge reserves of resources. For example, in this area, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara can boast of rice production, gold and other precious metals development and of course, heavy industries like cement manufacturing.\n\n\u201dAs a Government, we introduced policies and mechanisms to support such investments in a legal, ethical and inclusive manner.\n\n\u201dFor example, we have the National Food Security Council on Food Security Matters and the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative to develop local artisanal gold mining and ensure health and safety of mining workers and protect the environment.\n\n\u201dWe remain prepared to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of these opportunities through value addition so as to take advantage of the huge market here, as well as in the greater African region and the world at large.\u201d\n\nHighlighting other efforts to bring even development to all parts of the country, the president expressed confidence that the Ajaokuta\u2013Kaduna\u2013Kano (AKK) gas project, when completed, would bring gas for domestic and industrial purposes from the South-South region to the South East, North Central and North West Geopolitical zones.\n\nHe said the AKK project would significantly reduce cost of operations for industries in the regions.\n\nThe president reassured Nigerians that his government would continue to invest heavily in roads and rails to ease movement of people, goods and services, with a view to facilitating trade while lowering logistics costs associated with the inefficiencies of bad roads and bridges.\n\nOn security, the president reiterated his commitment to bring peace and stability to all parts of Nigeria, listing a raft of measures undertaken by this administration to ensure normalcy returns to the country.\n\n\u201dWe continue to recruit and equip security personnel while expanding our social investment programs to support the youth and some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n\n\u201dYou should all be reassured that we will win this battle against the criminal elements looking to destabilize our nation by hindering the progress of our economy.\n\n\u201dI want to now call on all entrepreneurs and businesses to emulate what is being done here. The task of nation building requires all hands to be on deck. The public and private sectors must collaborate if we are to achieve our aim of collective peace and prosperity across the entire nation,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman of BUA Cement, Abdul Samad Rabiu, who commended President Buhari for creating the enabling environment for businesses to thrive, acknowledged the support of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, in setting up the gigantic project.\n\nHe said \u201dso far, we have invested over a billion dollars in the past four years and we urge the CBN to continue to support industries like ours that use locally sourced raw materials to add value.\u201d\n\nHe said BUA would continue to invest more in the cement industry until Nigeria is self-sufficient and the commodity is made available, accessible, and affordable for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dIn the past 6 years, we have completed 4 plants \u2013 two in Obu, Edo State and two in Sokoto (of which this Sokoto line 4 is the fourth) with BUA\u2019s total production capacity now standing at 11.5million tonnes with the completion of this plant.\n\n\u201dNext year, we intend to complete the construction of two new plants of 3 million metric tonnes each for which construction is ongoing \u2013 one in Edo and the other, here in Sokoto,\u201d he said.\n\nRabiu said he looked to President Buhari commissioning these plants next year, during which total production capacity would be 17.5million metric tonnes.\n\nPledges tough time for evil forces\n\nAlso speaking at the palace of Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, President Buhari again directed the nation\u2019s Armed Forces and other security services to deal decisively with any person or group undermining efforts at achieving sustainable peace, security and stability in the country, assuring that the country will ultimately defeat the forces of evil.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI gave them specific orders not to spare any bandit or terrorist threatening the lives and property of innocent Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe president, who commiserated with the Government and people of Sokoto state over the recent loss of lives and property as a result of outrageous attacks by bandits and other criminal gangs, assured the people that he remains unrelenting in his resolve to put an end to heinous criminal activities in the state and other parts of the country.\n\nThe President wrote in the visitors\u2019 register: \u201cMy condolences to the Sultanate, the Government, and people of Sokoto State over the recent mindless killings by bandits and terrorists. Nigeria shall win the battle over evil.\u201d\n\nIn their remarks, the Governor Aminu Tambuwal and Sultan Abubakar thanked the president for the show of sympathy, assuring him of continued support towards peace and stability in the country.",

          "text": "Rafael Nadal moved one win away from a record 21st Grand Slam men\u2019s title after a dominant start enabled him to beat Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini in the Australian Open semi-finals.\n\nSeventh seed Berrettini eventually turned the match into a contest, but Nadal completed a 6-3 6-2 3-6 6-3 win.\n\nThe 35-year-old Spaniard is level on 20 major titles with long-time rivals Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.\n\nNadal will face Daniil Medvedev or Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\n\u201cThe first two sets were some of the best I\u2019ve played for a long time,\u201d said Nadal, who won his only Melbourne title in 2009.\n\n\u201cAgainst a difficult opponent, a great opponent, one of the best of the world, I was able to play I think at a very high level for a long time.\n\n\u201cI had to suffer and I had to fight but it means a lot to be in the final again.\u201d\n\nNadal\u2019s achievement in reaching a 29th Grand Slam final comes only a few months after he thought a foot injury could end his illustrious career.\n\nRussian second seed Medvedev plays Greek fourth seed Tsitsipas later on Friday in the second men\u2019s semi-final at Melbourne Park.\n\nIt is the first time both men\u2019s semi-finals have been played on the same day since 1999, after the decision by tournament organisers to put both women\u2019s semi-finals in the primetime Thursday night session.\n\nUS Open champion Medvedev, 25, was beaten in last year\u2019s final by Djokovic, who did not play this year after being deported from Australia in a visa row related to him being unvaccinated.\n\nTsitsipas, 23, is targeting his maiden Grand Slam title \u2013 after losing to Djokovic in last year\u2019s French Open final \u2013 and his first Melbourne final.\n\nBefore the match there were some lingering doubts about Nadal\u2019s chances, not least because of his injury problems last year.\n\nThese centred around the indoor conditions perhaps favouring the powerful Berrettini \u2013 severe thunderstorms in Melbourne meant the roof was closed throughout \u2013 and how 35-year-old Nadal would have recovered after being \u201cdestroyed physically\u201d from a gruelling five-set quarter-final against Canada\u2019s Denis Shapovalov.\n\nWith the benefit of two full days without a match since Tuesday\u2019s win, Nadal quickly quashed any uncertainty.\n\nNadal started sharply as he attacked Berrettini\u2019s backhand \u2013 considered the weakest part of the 25-year-old Italian\u2019s game \u2013 from the outset.\n\nA stream of mistakes came from this side as Berrettini fell 3-0 behind and Nadal appropriately sealed the opening set with a serve to the backhand, which the 2021 Wimbledon finalist returned into the net.\n\nThis Berrettini shot continued to break down in the second set, enabling Nadal to take his opening two service games and move into another 3-0 lead.\n\nHead bowed, Berrettini looked unsure how to neutralise Nadal and the other facets of his game were suffering too.\n\nWhen Nadal sealed the second set after one hour and 25 minutes, Berrettini had already hit 24 unforced errors. His inability to test Nadal \u2013 in part because of the Spaniard\u2019s brilliance \u2013 had been costly.\n\nHolding serve at the start of the third set, and putting scoreboard-pressure on Nadal, was imperative for Berrettini.\n\nOnce he achieved that, the Italian\u2019s confidence grew and his fearsome forehand began to trouble Nadal more.\n\nFinally he earned his first break points of the match, taking the second for a 5-3 lead with another forehand winner and serving out to love to ensure at least a fourth set.\n\nBoth men held serve in the opening seven games but Berrettini letting half a chance slip from 3-3 15-30 with two missed forehands proved crucial.\n\nBerrettini had held to love in five successive service games \u2013 but then let Nadal in when it mattered most.\n\nAfter Nadal missed a first break point with a wide forehand to end an intense 23-shot rally, Berrettini hit a forehand into the net for the third time in the game on the second.\n\nServing for the match, Nadal started with a double fault but clinched victory when Berrettini put another backhand into the net.",

          "title": "Russia Says It Won\u2019t Start a War as Ukraine Tensions Mount",
          "text": "Russia\u2019s top diplomat said Friday that Moscow will not start a war but warned that it wouldn\u2019t allow the West to trample on its security interests amid fears it is planning to invade Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, though Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, perhaps offering a path to de-escalation.\n\nTensions have soared in recent weeks, and the United States and its NATO allies worry that the concentration of about 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine heralds Moscow\u2019s intention to attack the ex-Soviet state. Russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans, but has demanded that NATO promise Ukraine will never be allowed to join and that the alliance roll back deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don\u2019t want a war,\u201d Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a live interview with Russian radio stations. \u201cBut we won\u2019t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden warned Ukraine\u2019s president a day earlier that there is a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that Russia could take military action against its neighbor in February.\n\nRussia\u2019s official response to those proposals \u2014 and the ultimate decision over whether to invade \u2014 rests with President Vladimir Putin, but the Kremlin has sounded a grim note thus far, saying there is \u201clittle ground for optimism.\u201d\n\nLavrov noted Friday that the U.S. suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. He said that Russia proposed discussing those issues years ago \u2014 but Washington and its allies never took them up on it until now.\n\nWhile he described the U.S. offers for dialogue on confidence-building measures as reasonable, he emphasized that Russia\u2019s main concerns are to stop NATO\u2019s expansion and the deployment of the alliance weapons near Russia\u2019s borders. He noted that international agreements say that the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others\u2019 \u2014 and that he would send letters to ask his Western counterparts to address that obligation.\n\n\u201cIt will be hard for them to wiggle out from answering why they aren\u2019t fulfilling the obligations sealed by their leaders not to strengthen their security at the expense of others,\u201d he said.\n\nAs tensions build, Washington warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine, including penalties targeting top Russian officials and key economic sectors. Several senior U.S. officials also said Thursday that Germany would not allow a newly constructed pipeline \u2014 which is meant to bring gas directly from Russia \u2014 to begin operations if Russia invades Ukraine.\n\nAsked about possible sanctions, Lavrov said that Moscow had warned Washington that their introduction would amount to a complete severing of ties.\n\nWhile Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the U.S. ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.\n\nRussia has launched a series of military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. The Russian military also has moved troops to Belarus, which borders Ukraine, for sweeping joint drills, raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack from the north.\n\nWhile concerns rise about an invasion, Ukraine is already beset by conflict. Following the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula and backed an insurgency in the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled.",

          "title": "Search Halted for Survivors of Capsized Boat off Florida, Leaving 34 Lost at Sea",
          "text": "Round-the-clock search operations were halted at nightfall, Coast Guard Petty Officer Jose Hernandez said, hours after U.S. authorities reported recovering four more bodies, bringing the tally of confirmed fatalities to five. A lone survivor was rescued on Tuesday morning after a tug boat crew found him clinging to the mostly submerged hull of the overturned boat. He said none of the 40 people aboard had been wearing life jackets. The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday called off a three-day search for 34 people lost at sea off Florida from a boat that capsized while engaged in what officials suspect was an attempt to smuggle migrants into the United States from the Bahamas. Since then, a small armada of Coast Guard and Navy vessels and aircraft have crisscrossed at least 1,500 square miles of open sea off Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast, an area about the size of Rhode Island.\n\nAsked if the remaining 34 missing migrants should be presumed dead, Burdian said: \u201cIt does mean that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely that anyone else has survived.\u201d The survivor told authorities the ill-fated vessel left the Bahamas\u2019 Bimini islands, about 50 miles (80 km) east of Miami, on Saturday night, and capsized the next morning in rough seas. He was picked up about 45 miles (72 km) east of Fort Pierce Inlet, off Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast, about midway between Miami and Cape Canaveral. Captain Jo-Ann Burdian, commander of the Coast Guard\u2019s Miami sector, said earlier on Thursday that the quest for more victims would be \u201csuspended\u201d at sunset \u201cif we don\u2019t receive additional specific information to help redirect our search.\u201d The Coast Guard and U.S. Homeland Security Department officials have said the vessel was involved in a human smuggling attempt, but the nationalities of those on board have not been disclosed.\n\nIn a separate incident, the Coast Guard reported intercepting a sailing vessel on Tuesday off another area of the Bahamas overloaded with 191 Haitian migrants believed to be headed for Florida. The Coast Guard said 189 people on that boat were turned over to Haitian authorities on Thursday. A mother and her child were transferred ashore to Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, for medical treatment on Tuesday, the day the boat was interdicted, the Coast Guard said. Anthony Salisbury, the agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Miami, said it had opened a criminal inquiry seeking to prosecute anyone who organized or profited from the venture. Voyages of vessels carrying Haitian migrants have grown more frequent as the Caribbean island nation faces worsening economic and political crises, as well as gang-related kidnappings.\n\nThe two incidents underscored a surge in migrants seeking passage to Florida in flimsy vessels through the Caribbean by way of the Bahamas, a known hub for seaborne human smuggling.",

I am not seeking to lead a region but the entire country,\u201d Anyim said during an interactive session with multi-media publishers in Abuja.\u201cWhether zoning or no zoning, I will contest. I am contesting because I have something to offer to Nigerians,\u201d said Anyim, who claimed the offices he held in the past had groomed him for the task ahead, adding also that Nigerians would see the difference if he emerged president in 2023.\u201cThe two offices I served in the past are not the same. I\u2019ve headed the parliament, but I have not head the executive. I brought stability to the Senate, I want to bring stability to the country.

Most jobs today will be history in the next few years. We are getting to the next quarter of the 21st century and between 2026 and 2050, most of today\u2019s job will be history.\n\n\u201cKnowledge economy will drive the economic direction,\u201d Anyim said of the 21st century industrial revolution the youths should be prepared for.\n\nOn his fight against corruption, Anyim said he would ensure institutions were strengthened.\n\n\u201cThe institution should be allow to do there work. For the institutions, we will put in place messures that will not allow corruption. By the time we deployed technology, where private sector drive every segment of our economic and national life, there is no way people will engage in corruption. People will have no option than to do their work without thinking about corruption.\n\n\u201cI was part of the people that made laws for the establishment of ICPC and EFCC.
