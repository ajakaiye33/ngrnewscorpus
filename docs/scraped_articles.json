          "title": "DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)",
          "text": "This is actually one of the complications of Diabetes and this occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called Ketones. When your body cannot produce sufficient insulin, you won\u2019t have enough energy because glucose level in your cells will be low. Now, as the insulin is not sufficient to help, your glucose enter the cell, your body will need energy to function and the energy is just not there. So the body will find a way to give you energy.\n\n\n\nThe body will start breaking down the already stored fats in your body and use it as fuel (energy).This process produces a build up of acids in the blood stream called Ketones. This build up of Ketones give rise to Diabetic Ketoacidosis.\n\nDiabetic Ketoacidosis can occur in a space of 24 hours. Sometimes it can take up to 2 days.\n\nThe symptoms are like your normal diabetic signs.\n\n*Polyuria (too much urination)\n\n*Polydipsia (Too much thirst)\n\n*Weakness, fatigue, Shortness of breath, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain.\n\nOne very distinguishing factor about it is the \u201cfruit scent breath\u201d.\n\nHave you seen some people that when they breath and you perceive their breath, it smells like they ate fruit, when actually they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a sign. An infection can cause DKA.\n\n*Other causes are physical and emotional stress. A woman that has been emotionally abused will have her body produce some hormones that antagonize insulin, and Ketoacidosis can occur. The woman will begin to lose weight because of that.\n\n*Other causes are Alcohol Abuse? Have you noticed that many Alcohol addicts, especially those that take raw alcohol like \u201cspirit\u201d usually lose alot of weight? It\u2019s Ketoacidosis in action.\n\n* If you have Pancreatitis (Inflammed pancreas). It can cause it.\n\nNote that once the Ketones or blood acids in your system becomes consistently much, it gets to a time that it puts much pressure on your Kidney and Liver to expel it and when it\u2019s over worked, it could lead to Kidney problems.\n\nDKA can also lead to brain swelling that can eventually cause a Coma and fluid build up in the Lungs. That is why you discover that long Diabetic patients if care is not taken usually enter into Coma.\n\nHow can you treat DKA?\n\nOnce the Ketones or blood acids in your system becomes consistently much, it gets to a time that it puts much pressure on your Kidney and Liver to expel it and when it\u2019s over worked, it could lead to Kidney problems. DKA can also lead to brain swelling that can eventually cause a Coma and fluid build up in the Lungs. That is why you discover that long Diabetic patients if care is not taken usually enter into Coma.\n\nDrink plenty of water. This will help flush them out of the body through urine.\n\n2. Electrolytes can help. Example is Sodium, Potassium and Chloride. The more reason you will need to take a medication that help balance electrolyte such as QUANTUMINPLUS / MIRAMIN Q\n\n3.If you have DKA, please DON\u2019T EXERCISE! Let me say it again! Don\u2019t, exercise! Don\u2019t! Exercise can help put you in Ketosis. When you exercise, your body uses up the available glucose, and when this happens, your body will switch to fat in order to derive energy, so it will start breaking down the fat thereby producing more Ketones, and your body doesn\u2019t need that at that point. The more reason you see some Diabetic patients, they used to be fat before, but when Diabetes set in, they start shrinking\n\nSupplements to treat DKA\n\nBLOOD DETOX cleanses the blood of hot toxins, removes ketones and other pathogenic substances from the blood. It also clears off skin diseases that are blood originated such as Acne, pimples, itchy skin, bad breath, etc. Blood Detox is also good for those with persistent blood diseases and other blood infections, including HIV/AIDS.\n\nMIRAMIN Q / QUANTUMINPLUS helps to balance electrolytes which is very good in reducing ketonic levels. It also improves body PH from acidity to alkalinity.\n\nGluconature help to improve the Pancreatic secretion of insulin, necessary for the regulating blood sugar and treating Type 2, Gestational and Prediabetes, as well as ensuring the availability of insulin in order to reduce the risk of Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n\nHello Viewdenlife, I have been treating Diabetes type 1 with GLUCONATURE PLUS and I have witnessed amazing results with the decline of my blood sugar and even the symptoms arereduced to minimal.\n\nI suffer from very weak ERECTION due to past drugs used in treating diabetes, you recommended NITKICK and my ERECTION has since surged and harder than ever, but I don\u2019t have the urge or libido sometimes, what can you recommend I use? Bayo\n\nGlad to know Gluconature plus is giving a good result on your blood sugar. NITKICK gives instant hard ERECTION,30 minutes prior to intercourse and is good for men who don\u2019t have time to treat ERECTILE dysfunction. But for libido and stamina boosting, I\u2019ll advise you combine the NITKICK with VIGRX for men or ViMAX as either of them gradually boosts your hormone level and increase the libido you need.\n\nAdults in need of any of these products should visit www.viewden.com to place orders or call 08034666358.

A port is one of the infrastructures that take years to plan and build. This is why we are working to make it better and get ready for the future,\u201d Svendsen said.\n\nThe APM Terminals COO said the technology embedded in the new building will improve container handling operations and processing in the terminal particularly in enabling electronic invoicing, electronic receipt and online payment processes that allow customers fast-track their documentation.\n\nAlso speaking, the Country Managing Director of APM Terminals Nigeria, Klaus Laursen, said APM Terminals Apapa has invested a total of $438 million on enabling developing infrastructure, acquiring equipment and improving processes at the terminal.\n\n\u201cIn APM Terminals, we have led with a strong ambition to become a world-class terminal operator. We enable access to jobs, products, foods, and medicine that allow people to create and live better.\n\n\u201cThe aim is to make APM Terminals Apapa a better trade and logistics zone. We just have to be better and improve everyday by investing in our people and infrastructure in order to have a smarter and digitalised business that serves the need of our customers and the country at large,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, commended APM Terminals for raising the standards of port operation in Nigeria, and for adding immense value to the port over the past 16 years.\n\nBello-Koko, who was represented by Ayo Durowaiye, said, \u201cIt is also gratifying to note that APM Terminals is also paying attention to exports particularly now that the Federal Government is focused on growing the non-oil and agro business sectors.\u201d\n\nThe Zonal Coordinator, Zone A, Nigeria Customs Service, Assistant Comptroller-General Modupe Aremu, represented by Comptroller Queen Ogbudu, also commended APM Terminals Apapa for setting the pace in terminal operations in Nigeria.\n\nSome customers of APM Terminals Apapa including the Managing Director of Blue Anchor, Emeka Dimude and the Logistics Director of Promasidor, Idowu Osoneye, in their goodwill messages at the event, were full of encomiums for APM Terminals Apapa for ensuring best practices and top-notch services at the port.\n\nThe Port Manager, Lagos Port Complex Apapa, Olufunmilayo Olotu; the Commissioner of Police Apapa Port, Jonathan Towuru, the chief executive",

          "text": "\u2026Says N21 million is a governor\u2019s ten months salary\n\nBy Ogalah Ibrahim\n\nA gubernatorial aspirant in Katsina State, Engr Muttaqha Rabe Darma has condemned the call for aspirants interested in running for governorship position under the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in 2023 to purchase the expression of interest form for the whopping sum of N21 million.\n\nAccording to Muttaqha, the announcement is invariably telling aspirants to steal if they eventually occupy the office.\n\nThe former Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), made the remark while fielding questions from journalists over the weekend after unveiling his book titled \u201cPathways to Greatness: The Katsina State of the Future\u201d\n\nThe PDP card-carrying member expresses shock that party members have refused to come out and protest against the decision.\n\nIn his words:\n\n\u201cHow can you ask aspirants to pay N21 million just to contest for governorship. N21 million is 10 months salary of a Governor. Even if it is one month\u2019s salary, that money is still too much and I cannot afford to pay such an amount to contest to be Governor in my state.\n\n\u201cWhat are they trying to tell the contestants? They are teaching them to steal when they come into the office. This is corruption playing out but people are just folding their hands and not saying anything. If we fail to protest now next time it might rise up to N100 million.\n\nMuttaqha while describing the decision by the party as a slap on the faces of Nigerians said \u201cwhat this means is that whoever is qualified and interested in contesting for governorship under the PDP must have a Godfather that will be able to give him that money and if you eventually win and become Governor you will become a slave to the Godfather who will do whatever he likes with you. However, if you manage to pay the money and you lose in the election, you will become impoverished.\n\nThis is not supposed to be.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\n2023: Crisis brews as PDP stakeholders accuse NWC members of sabotage\n\nMuttaqha decried how the cost for the expression of interest form which was sold for N6 million in 2019 has now risen by over 200%, not minding the difficult times experienced in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cthe governorship form was sold for N6 million in 2019 and now they are adding N14 million instead of reducing it knowing that the problems the country is facing now are worse than what the country experienced in 2019.\n\nAccording to Muttaqha, only government workers or politicians who are thieves or involved in shady deals will be able to afford N21 million to purchase the governorship form.\n\nIn his words:\n\n\u201c92 to 95% of those who have bought the form are all politically exposed people. I have the list. They are people who have occupied one political office or the other previously. I don\u2019t think these people made their money legitimately.\n\n\u201cI worked in several government parastatals before and I also held political offices. So I can confidently tell you that any government worker that has become rich I swear to you is a thief. It either he stole or short-changed the people or combined both. You don\u2019t become rich working for the government. If you want to be rich go and do business. People need to know this.\u201d\n\nDespite all the public outcry, Muttaqha is yet to disclose if he will be dumping the party though from his body language and speculations making the round he may soon decamp to the New Nigeria Peoples Party to pursue his dream of governing the state.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "File: President Muhammadu Buhari with the Vice President Prof Yemi Osinbajo(SAN) and the CBN Governor Mr. Godwin Emefiele as President unveiled the eNaira at the State House Abuja.\n\nBy Emeka Anaeto, Business Editor\n\nAfrica\u2019s first digital currency, eNaira, issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), as part of its central bank digital currency (CBCD) programme, is projected to be running on about 10,000 downloads per day, dpd, in the second quarter of this year, Q2\u201922. This projection by a source in one of the commercial banks leading in the eNaira platform, follows the 7,300 dpd recorded in the first quarter of the year, Q1\u201922.\n\nHowever, the source also indicated that though the downloads record is not doing badly given the relative novelty of the product, the operators are concerned with the low level of Person-to-Person, P2P, transaction, indicating that actual usage by individuals is not as active as the downloads.\n\nBut he disclosed that Person-to-Bank and Bank-to-Person have remained upbeat constituting about 90% eNaira transactions so far.\n\nCBN has stated that the eNaira transactions recorded range from P2P; Person to Merchant, P2M; Bank to Person; Person to Bank and Bank to Merchants and Merchants to Bank.\n\nConsumer wallet downloads have also been far predominant over merchant wallet, a situation analysts believe has to do with lack of awareness by businesses as well as restrictions regarding Bank Verification Numbers, BVN, and other Know Your Customer, KYC, requirements.\n\nHowever, from North America to Australia, and all over Africa, e-wallets were downloaded, demonstrating global usage.\n\nFurthermore, it showed that the app was also downloaded in South America, Europe, Asia, and in almost all the countries in Africa.\n\nThe eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same naira with far more possibilities, according to the apex bank\n\nCBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said in January that the present rollout of the eNaira was intended for banked Nigerians. He went on to say that the BVN is included as a need to prevent fraudsters from hacking into the system.\n\nEmefiele further stated: \u201cSince its launch about three months ago, Nigerians have continued to gradually adopt eNaira as a fast and reliable means of exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Person to Bank and Bank to Person constitute 90% of what we see in the market, and as you will observe, we spent the last three months observing and monitoring the system and addressing issues mostly around initial onboarding,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor of the apex bank stated that the eNaira\u2019s current rollout was meant of the banked Nigerians. He added that the inclusion of the BVN as a requirement is to prevent fraudsters from hacking into the system.\n\nHe said \u201cWe feel that you must have a BVN and you must have an account to be able to access it, And we also find that this has created some kind of constraints on people about onboarding with BVN and the rest of them. But again, we believe that what we do by the use of the BVN is the best so as to avoid fraudsters from hacking into the system.\n\n\u201cMost of the complaints received were mainly around the inability of prospective users to onboard and activate the E wallet due to a mismatch of BVN enrollment records.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the benefits of the digital currency, CBN\u2019s Director of Corporate Communications, Mr Osita Nwanisiobi, said, \u201cThe e-Naira is expected to deepen financial inclusion by bringing more people into the financial space, support a resilient payment ecosystem, reduce the cost of processing cash, enable direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens, increase transparency in revenue and tax collections, facilitate diaspora remittances, reduce the cost of financial transactions and improve the efficiency of payments.\u201d\n\nNoting that there have been encouraging responses to the e-Naira, Osita, added, \u201cCustomers who download the eNaira Speed Wallet App will be able to onboard and create their wallet; fund their eNaira wallet from their bank account; transfer eNaira from their wallet to another wallet and make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, appeal to Nigerians to embrace the eNaira just like our physical Naira \u2013 our pride.\u201d\n\nThe eNaira, according to the CBN, would allow Africa\u2019s most populous nation to experience the full benefits of the global digital economy.\n\nThis payment system now provides high-value and time-critical payment services to financial institutions, and ultimately serves as the backbone for every electronic payment in Nigeria.\n\nPegged at a one-to-one exchange rate with the Naira, the CBDC would ultimately reduce the influence of informal, cash-based economy in Nigeria and significantly expand the country\u2019s tax base. The result, according to the CBN, would be a brighter economic future for the nation \u2013 to the tune of an estimated $29billion rise in GDP over the next decade.\n\nThe rollout of the eNaira last October wasn\u2019t just momentous for the Nigerian economy. While 87 nations are currently investigating how to implement their own CBDCs, only two others have actually been officially launched.\n\nDesigned to accommodate the needs of over 200 million citizens, however, the eNaira is by far the largest active CBDC project in the world.\n\nAnalysts believe that in a national economy that has been hit especially hard by the pandemic, the new digital currency is designed to give the CBN new and valuable insights into how and when money is spent, as well as disburse financial aid more quickly to those in need.\n\nAs such, \u201cthe eNaira has largely been welcomed by Nigerians,\u201d explains Professor Iwa Salami of the University of East London, especially given its potential to lower remittance transfer costs.\n\nHowever, some of the challenges to faster adoption are embedded in Nigeria\u2019s structural economic and environmental problems. For instance, the eNaira is a mobile-first digital currency, living in wallets that can only function in places with reliable access to mobile data.\n\nFurthermore, the eNaira faces tremendous headwinds from other, less transparent forms of digital money. Amid a general lack of confidence in the government\u2019s economic policy, cryptocurrency has grown markedly in popularity throughout Nigeria as a hedge against the weak Naira and a straightforward way of transferring money in and out of the country. For consumers dabbling in Ethereum and Bitcoin, therefore, the eNaira is almost irrelevant, explains Professor Joshua Chukwuere of North-West University, South Africa.\n\nOne of the ways the CBN intended on breaking these patterns was through boosting financial inclusion. According to a report in 2020, up to 36% of Nigerians remain unbanked while only a third have access to an ATM or a bank branch within a kilometre of their home. A digital currency, by contrast, would allow the CBN to go over the heads of commercial banks and bring millions of financially excluded citizens into the real economy. It would also help to streamline the process of getting remittances into the country.\n\nThe IMF perspective\n\nWhile the International Monetary Fund, IMF, has pointed out the digital currency\u2019s vulnerability to fraud, the head of its Nigeria desk, Jack Ree, considers the transaction limits and stringent KYC requirements sufficient protection against this threat. Ree also applauds the CBN\u2019s cautious attitude toward rolling out the eNaira.\n\n\u201cNigeria is bold enough to volunteer itself for this social experiment,\u201d he says \u2013 going a lot further than the 87 other central banks that have talked about implementing a CBDC, but have yet to take action.\n\nEven so, ordinary Nigerians still need convincing that the eNaira is worth their time, with figures from earlier this year indicating that peer-to-peer transactions constituted only 10% of the total number made using the digital currency. That\u2019s partly down to a problem with promoting the eNaira, says some experts, which has largely been left to the CBN.\n\nCentral banks are not institutions that are used to dealing directly with the general public, instead, commercial banks will need to play a greater role in promoting the digital currency to their customers.\n\nThat should help in improving uptake of the eNaira among Nigeria\u2019s small trading community, explains Chukwuere, which forms a considerable slice of the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cHow many people in Lagos today are aware of the eNaira?\u201d he says. Knowledge of the eNaira and what it can do simply \u201cis not there\u201d.\n\nFor her part, Salami remains optimistic as to the eNaira\u2019s future, especially if measures are taken quickly to improve its functionality in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for the CBN to think very quickly about mechanisms to improve accessibility to the eNaira, without necessarily watering down its KYC/AML requirements,\u201d she says.\n\nThat also needs to be matched by a sustained effort at making the digital currency relevant to those who regularly receive remittances.\n\nVanguard News",

We later reached out to the state government for assistance. We are very happy that the Governor has intervened \u201c.\n\nAlso speaking, Elizabeth Emmanuel, a returnee, who hails from Ikono LGA but resided in Jibia LGA in Katsina, said her shop and home were razed down by the arsonists, who attacked their community at night, killing several people in their sleep.\n\n\u201cWe got back home and started hearing loud shooting at night, and we all started running for our dear lives. All I could take out from our house are my children and a few clothes. Luckily for us, we were escorted to the IDP camp by soldiers.\u201d\n\nShe narrated that they were, however, linked to the President of the Akwa Ibom Community in Katsina by a fellow Akwa Ibomite in the camp.",

          "text": "Nowhere is safe any longer for Nigerians, says Obasanjo\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has said the Muhammadu Buhari administration is overwhelmed by rising insecurity across the country.\n\nHe said the development showed that no part of the country or place where Nigerians are safe: in vehicles, on the train or on an aircraft.\n\nThe elder statesman, who was reacting yesterday to the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, said\n\nthe country is in a precarious situation.\n\nObasanjo spoke at his Penthouse within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, te Ogun State capital, when a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Dr. Ugochukwu Williams, and his team visited him.\n\nWilliams, who was accompanied by House of Representatives aspirants from Plateau and Imo states, was at Obasanjo\u2019s home for consultation over his presidential aspiration.\n\nWhile calling for concerted efforts among Nigerians against the rising cases of insecurity, the former President noted that the current administration had been overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nBut he urged Nigerians to disallow the situation from engulfing the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians are no longer safe on the road, on the train and at the airport,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe ex-President said Nigerians should not to allow themselves to be overwhelmed by the insecurity challenges.\n\n\u201cSo, if anybody comes to say I want to see you, I want to talk to you, I will say: \u2018You\u2019re welcome\u2019. This is because I believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again, that the situation we are in this country is not a situation where one man will say yes, he has a solution unless we are deceiving ourselves.\n\n\u201cI believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation.\n\n\u201cA situation where you are not safe on the road, you are not safe in the train, you are not safe at the airport, shows a very serious situation.\n\n\u201cI believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration. But we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has confirmed that 186 out of the 362 passengers who boarded the ill-fated train from Abuja to Kaduna last Monday night are in safety.\n\nIn a statement last night by the Managing Director, Fidet Okhiria, also said 51 phone numbers on the manifest are either switched off or not reachable since last Tuesday.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIn our quest to keep the general public informed with ongoing development regarding the clearing of the incident site (recovery of the rolling stock, repairs of the track) and status of onboard passengers the AK9 train of Monday, March 28, 2022, the corporation hereby provides the following updates as at end of work today April 3, 2022.\n\nRead Also: Osinbajo, Obasanjo, Jonathan condemn coups in Africa\n\n\u201cTwo coaches (SP 00016 and SP 00017) earlier re-railed were safely moved to Rigasa Station. This brings the total number of recovered coaches and safely moved to NRC Stations to seven.\n\n\u201cIntensive work continues on track repairs. More concrete sleepers were moved to site while some section of twisted tracks has been straightened.\u201d\n\nGiving an update on the status of the passengers, Okhiria added: \u201cOf the 362 validated passengers on board the attacked AK9 train service on March 28, 2022, 186 persons on the manifest are confirmed to be safe and at their various homes. (Additional 14 persons confirmed safe today).\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has said 21 passengers are still missing from the over 970 passengers on board of a Kaduna-bound speed train from Abuja around 8 p.m on March 28 in Dutse, Kaduna State.\n\nThe corporation announced that 172 other passengers on the train have been reunited with their families.\n\nNRC\u2019s Managing Director Fidet Okhiria announced these in the latest (the fourth) statement issued yesterday since the incident took place.\n\nThe NRC boss said the corporation was cooperating with security agencies to ensure that all missing passengers are reunited with their families and the tracks made safe for its operations.\n\n\u201cThe corporation also confirms the update that a total of 172 passengers on board the AK9 are safe and okay while 21 passengers are still reported missing.\n\n\u201cLet us assure our esteemed passengers and the general public that the corporation, in collaboration with all security agencies, will leave no stone unturned in our efforts at rescuing the missing persons,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NRC boss explained the current conditions of the coaches involved in the attack.\n\nOkhiria said: \u201cAt the end of work on Saturday (March 02, 2022), the NRC\u2019s restoration team has further recovered four more coaches and two of the coaches (SP 00007 and SP 00013) and has been safely taken to Idu and Rigasa stations respectively.\n\n\u201cThe other two coaches are still at the site due to damaged tracks. This brings the total coaches recovered to seven, but only five successfully moved to the stations.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss, who said there were efforts to link the tracks, added that 80 metres of the affected sections had been fixed, including affected sleepers and twisted rails.",

Clashes are reduced. Lives are saved, and livelihoods are enriched.\n\n\u201cWe will always remember how PDP politicians intentionally encouraged and exploited the black market in currency exchange to convert ill-gotten gains to foreign currency and undermine our national currency, then spirited their funds abroad in their billions and into foreign bank accounts.\n\n\u201cToday with APC, we support our national currency; we have achieved self-sufficiency in rice and fertiliser production; we refuse to allow greedy politicians and businessmen to hide their money overseas, and instead build an economy here in Nigeria for all.\n\n\u201cWe will always know how PDP politicians raided the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), consistently failed to pay into the Federation Account and, in the last year of PDP misrule, $20 billion was simply found \u2018missing\u2019.\n\n\u201cToday with APC, funds from NNPC are directly and transparently used to fund social and health programmes \u2013 such as COVID-19 response, the construction of roads, bridges and rail, and equipping of hospitals to cope with new and existing challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency also carpeted the PDP governors, who were signatories to the communiqu\u00e9, saying their antecedents make them unfit for the trust of Nigerians.\n\nIt said they have for long profited from playing divisive politics, setting the nation up in flames by promoting hate.",

          "text": "All Progressives Congress (APC) National Secretary Senator Iyiola Omisore yesterday accused people he described as \u201cdrowning politicians\u201d of spreading propaganda against him.\n\nHe lamented that a decade after the Bola Ige murder case, Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka still referred to him as a prime suspect, despite being cleared by the court.\n\nOmisore, a former deputy governor of Osun State, said it was curious that Soyinka, who accused the Obasanjo government of complicity in Ige\u2019s death when he described the government \u201cas a nest of killers\u201d, could now describe him as a suspect in 2022.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate in a statement at the weekend said Omisore\u2019s endorsement as APC Secretary by President Muhammadu Buhari would tamper with judicial inquiries into Ige\u2019s death because he is a prime suspect in the murder case.\n\nTaking exception to the eminent scholar\u2019s statement, Omisore said \u201cit is an unnecessary propaganda some drowning politicians are trying to spread.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary also threatened to sue a political group in Osun APC for fabrication and defamation.\n\nOmisore said \u201cas brilliant as Prof. Soyinka is, he, no doubt, has monopoly of knowledge.\n\nIn a statement by his office, Omisore said: \u201cIf the court of the land has vindicated a man, it is naive of him after nearly a decade to link Senator Iyiola Omisore to further search.\n\nHe added that \u201ccivil and criminal law knowledge should tell professor to ask his cousin, OBJ for the murder.\u201d\n\nOmisore added: \u201cThe world is aware of the framing of Senator Iyiola Omisore and his travails and trials facing murder charges and his subsequent acquittal and discharge, almost a decade ago by a competent court of the land.\n\n\u201cSo, how come any man, can still refer to him as a possible suspect? The Prof is very wrong to say all that. It takes wickedness to spread the statements.\u201d\n\nOmisore alleged that despite the fact that not all Soyinka\u2019s intervention in national life has produced the expected outcome in the long run, society has continued to hold him in esteem.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is part of history and we are not too young, when we read of him, that professor too carried a gun into a Radio station; a criminal offense against the state. Yet, we continue to honour him.\n\n\u201cCan we also forget that Prof was appointed the chairman of education summit that gave birth to a single uniform for all secondary and primary schools and Opon Imo, during the tenure of Rauf Aregesola as governor of Osun State. A failed Education Policy that history will not readily forget.\n\n\u201cSo, at 88, it\u2019s better for him to stay clear of politics and not allow drowning politicians to use him to fight a cause he knows nothing about. It is a subtle warning to the respected Nobel Laureate.\n\nOmisore recalled that in 2004, Soyinka, who was 70, accused the Obasanjo government of complicity in the death of Ige by referring to the government as a \u201cnest of killers\u201d\n\nHe lamented that, in April, 2022, the Nobel Laureate, who is now 88, is complaining about his choice as National Secretary.\n\nHe also regretted that Soyinka, once attacked another Yoruba son, Gbenga Daniel, an engineer and former two-term governor of his native Ogun State.\n\nHe maintained that the record shows that he and others were tried for two and half years and later discharged and acquitted by the court.\n\nOmisore said: \u201cThe recent volte face of Soyinka on the Bola Ige matter gives one a cause for concern. First, I was not a member of cabinet in Obasanjo\u2019s government and second, a court of competent jurisdiction had set me and others free after a grueling two and half years trial with N2 billion damages awarded still unpaid by the state government.\n\n\u201cBesides, why has Omisore/Bola Ige matter become an issue of campaigns and elections deliberately used by Omisore\u2019s opponents to undermine his influence?\n\n\u201cOr, are some people who are worried by the erudite and strong personality and capacity of Omisore as National Secretary using Soyinka to settle scores or pursue their political ambitions?\n\n\u201cPolitics is a game and an avenue to serve and the Nobel Laureate can throw his hat in the ring if he so wishes instead of making unsubstantiated claims and causing confusion here and there, acts, that don\u2019t befit his international recognition as an elder and statesman.",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe 37-man committee, which has two weeks to complete its assignment is expected to announce its position at the end of its meeting tomorrow.\n\nThe outcome of the panel\u2019s report would determine the fate of former vice president Atiku Abubakar, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, former secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim, and former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, in the PDP presidential primary scheduled for May 28 and 29.\n\nOthers who have obtained the PDP presidential nomination form include, Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed; Akwa Ibom Governor, Udom Emmanuel; former Senate president, Abubakar Bukola Saraki; Oliver Diana Teriela and Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Ovation Publisher, Dele Mohammed, Sam Ohuabunwa and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\nThe PDP committee on the review of the 2019 general election had recommended that the 2023 presidential ticket be thrown open to all qualified aspirants.\n\nRegardless, the issue has been generating concerns in the party as leaders from the North and South disagreed on whether the ticket should be zoned or thrown open to all qualified aspirants.\n\nWhile PDP from the North are pushing for the ticket to be thrown open, the South East, South South and South West chapters of the party have continued to insist the ticket should be ceded to the South in line with principle of rotation of elective offices as enshrined in the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that in the last few days there have been serious horse-trading as the two camps make frantic efforts to advance their positions. However, a party source told Daily Sun that the northern group opposed to zoning seemed to be having an upper hand.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that several leaders of the party believe that a northern candidate is best suited to win the 2023 presidential poll for the PDP. And more than anything else, we want to win the election.\n\n\u201cHowever, there have also been argument from some leaders in the South, that majority of the presidential aspirants from the North were responsible for the party\u2019s loss in 2015. And should not be rewarded with the 2023 presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nAnother source told Daily Sun that the 37-man committee, which consists of one member from each of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT, is skewed in favour of the North. Consequently, he noted that the committee is likely to throw the contest for the PDP primary.\n\nMeanwhile, the presidential ambition of Governor Wike, has received a boost as leaders and stakeholders in the Lagos State chapter of the People Democratic Party (PDP) gave him their blessings.\n\nSpeaking during a visit by Wike and his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, to the Lagos office of the former deputy national chairman of PDP, Olabode George, the party leader said Nigeria needs a president that can take it out of the doldrums and Wike has the capacity to do so.\n\nGeorge, who spoke on behalf of the ward and local government chairmen of the party who were all present, said the party is ready to support Wike and give him their backing. \u201cThe governor told us in clear terms what he wants. When it comes to courage and resourcefulness, he has it in abundance. He also has age on his side. We need a bright person who can bring us out of the doldrums and we\u2019re ready to support you in Lagos. It shall be well with you.\u201d\n\nOn his ambition, Wike said we cannot continue to allow the country go the way it is sliding and something has to be done, while insisting he has the capacity to take back power.\n\n\u201cAll I have come to say is that I want to be given the opportunity on May 28 and 29 to represent PDP in the fight coming up in 2023. We must win this election. What we are going to do is to go and take back the power and give to PDP. We are not begging. We are ready to take it back because the power belongs to PDP,\u201d Wike said.",

I am called to be a pastor, but if you want to quote me, please quote me correctly. As I speak, God has not told me if there will be election in 2023 or not. The year 2023 is still far away from now; He may decide to speak tomorrow, but as of now he has not told me anything about 2023.\n\n\u201cBut it is in the news, and most you have read it that over 80 per cent of crude oil produced in the country is stolen and nobody is denying or refuting it. The quest to as who is stealing the crude? How are the countries buying the stolen oil? Are they the friends of the country or enemies. What do they need the money for. It is also in the news that 90 percent of the 20 percent of the revenue from the is used to service debt and that we are still borrowing.\u201d\n\nAdeboye also lamented the security situation in the country, especially repeated attacks in Kaduna State, querying why bandits were so focused on the northern Nigeria economic and political capital.\n\n\u201cToday you can\u2019t enter Kaduna by road, rail or by air because you will be attacked by the terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why he is urging Christians to participate in politics, Adeboye said: \u201cChristians should participate in elections by voting and ensuring that their votes count. The reason I cannot vote is that I am the father of all; my children are in all the parties and so I can\u2019t vote. Christians must be interested in politics because witches are interested. So when witches are showing interest in politics, should Christians be sleeping?\u201d\n\nExplaining why he prayed for politicians that sought his blessings, Adeboye said while he has no preferred candidate, he always prayed that the perfect will of God be done in the life of each contestant. \u201cI will pray for any politician that comes to seek for prayers before any election,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\n\n*Agrees with federal lawmakers that nowhere is safe again\n\n*ACF, Afenifere, PDP caution against use of mercenaries to fight terrorists\n\n*Seven of 11 coaches rerailed to safety after train attack, 80 meters of affected tracks repaired\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja, James Sowole in Abeokuta and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, said Nigeria\u2019s security crisis was reaching a tipping point, stressing that the situation is made even more serious as President Muhammadu Buhari seems overwhelmed by the country\u2019s problems. Obasanjo, who spoke in Abeokuta, was reacting to the recent bomb attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train, which killed eight persons, with many other passengers kidnapped or missing.\n\nThe former president agreed with the position of some members of the House of Representatives, who declared last week that nowhere was safe in the country.\n\n\n\nThat was as the foremost northern socio-political body, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF); the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cautioned against the proposal to use mercenaries in the fight against terrorists in the country.\n\n\n\nThe idea of resorting to mercenaries was mooted recently by the Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, after confessing he was \u201cangry, frustrated and felt totally helpless\u201d over the activities of terrorists.\n\nBut, in a welcome development, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), yesterday, said it had successfully re-railed seven out of the 11 coaches that were affected on the Kaduna-bound AK9 train, when it was attacked by terrorists. NRC also said 80 metres of the affected rail tracks had been repaired.\n\nObasanjo said recent happenings had shown that Nigerians were no longer safe anywhere in the country, whether in vehicles, on the train or at the airport.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, inside his residence, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, while receiving a PDP presidential aspirant, Dr. Ugochukwu Williams, and his team, Obasanjo lamented that Nigerians \u201care no longer safe on the road, on the train and at the airport.\u201d He called for a concerted effort by stakeholders to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe former president said the present government was overwhelmed by the situation, cautioning, however, that Nigerians must not allow the problem to overcome the country.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, if anybody comes to say I want to see you, I want to talk to you, I will say \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019. This is because I believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again that the situation we are in this country is not a situation, where one man will say, yes, he has a solution, unless we are deceiving ourselves. I believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation.\n\n\n\n\u201cA situation where you are not safe on the road, you are not safe on the train, you are not safe at the airport, shows a very serious situation. I believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObasanjo wished Williams well in the pursuit of his presidential ambition.\n\n\n\nIn his remarks, Williams, flanked by House of Representatives aspirants from Plateau and Imo states, said he had, with regard to his presidential ambition, visited Obasanjo for consultation. The presidential hopeful described the former president as a leader, who was passionate about the peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\nWilliams said he was on a mission to \u201crescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nACF Cautions Against Use of Mercenaries in Anti-terrorist War\n\nArewa Consultative Forum (ACF) warned against the use of mercenaries in the fight against terrorists in the country.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, whose state had of recent been under deadly attacks by terrorists, was reported as saying he, alongside four other governors in the North-west, would hire foreign mercenaries to fight terrorists if the military failed to end the persistent attacks.\n\n\n\nEl-Rufai had said during an interview last Friday with journalists, after briefing Buhari on the attacks in his state, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, \u201cWhy is it that up till now the security has not gone to kill them (terrorists)? Where are our soldiers? Why have they not done it? That is why I have come to see Mr President.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd also I have said that if these actions are not taken, it becomes a must for us as governors to take measures to protect our citizens, even if it means we will import mercenaries from outside the country to do it.\n\n\u201cIf our soldiers fail, I swear to God, we will do that. This issue has gotten to an alarming state.\u201d\n\nBut ACF, in a statement yesterday in Kaduna, signed by its Secretary General, Murtala Aliyu, warned, \u201cInviting mercenaries to fight our cause must be treated with utmost caution.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe forum said it understood the frustration of the governors over the security situation, but noted that the country should avoid any haphazard approach to its problems. It maintained, \u201cThe security of the country rests on the central government and calls for cursory, calm, implementable and lasting solution.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, on the proposal to escort trains from Abuja to Kaduna, and Ibadan to Lagos or the Itakpe routes by the Nigerian Air Force, the forum urged security agencies to redesign their strategies and operations by deploying machinery and manpower to launch attacks on bandit and terrorist enclaves.\n\n\n\nACF stated, \u201cDedicating such operations to only railway lines shall make air and road users more vulnerable to such attacks. The new dimension of the terror attacks in the country, both on human and infrastructure, calls for total war.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe authorities may look at the possibility of utilising volunteers, such as the ex-servicemen and women, the civilian task forces, hunters and whatever is available to make every inch of Nigeria habitable and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe must appreciate the responsibility bestowed on us by providence as the largest black nation and as a leader on our continent, must do everything within our powers to keep Nigeria stable and strong.\u201d\n\nAfenifere: Inviting Mercenary is Ominous\n\nAfenifere flayed the suggestion by the Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, to invite foreign mercenaries to fight terrorism in the state, saying it represents an ominous sign for the country.\n\n\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, said the idea, coming from one of the closest allies of Buhari and a top member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), whose state faced grave security challenges, \u201ccalls for serious interrogation and action on the part of all those who should act.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said the fact that El-Rufai made the suggestion immediately after a meeting with the president could be an indication that what the governor heard from Buhari, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, was not reassuring enough.\n\n\n\nAccording to Afenifere, \u201cFor, were Rufai to be convinced with the readiness of the federal government to confront the security situation, he would not have talked about seeking an alternative action, particularly, seeking the help of foreign mercenaries. This point is very important to be borne in mind as we interrogate the security problems confronting us today.\n\n\u201cFor, hiring the services of foreign mercenary is certainly beyond the power of any state governor, according to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And El-Rufai knows this so well. So, for him to assert that he (and a few of his colleagues) will resort to this option could be a pointer to certain things that had hitherto not been so clear to members of the public.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmong those could be the possibility that, perhaps, armed foreigners are already in our midst. It could also be a pointer to the fact that El-Rufai saw some kind of unwillingness on the part of the federal government to confront this problem headlong, hence his desire to seek help his own way \u2013 even when the manner of seeking such help is constitutionally beyond his power.\n\n\u201cBut then, his position could be understood against the background of desperation and the need to put an end to the horror going on by any means possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfenifere asserted that the solution to the problem did not lie in hiring foreign mercenaries but sincerely seeking available local the answers. The group said the first step was for the Buhari government to be genuinely determined to put an end to the carnage.\n\nIt stated, \u201cIn this determination should be adequate funding of the armed forces, proper motivation of the forces, a stoppage to the kid glove treatment being given to terrorists, and more importantly, immediate approval for willing state governments to set up their own police forces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are dangers in bringing in foreign mercenaries by these governors, because their antecedents in the recent past do not give us reasons to trust them. They could, perhaps, use the said mercenaries against indigenous people.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said such a call by a sitting governor exposed the governor as preferring to address an issue on the surface rather than from its root.\n\n\n\nIt stated, \u201cWho would pretend not to know that many of our farmers and local people live in hamlets and villages? Would it not be those innocent people, who would be so \u2018cleared\u2019 especially since fifth columnists are likely to have informed the terrorists of the planned invasion beforehand? This is one of the reasons why the governors cannot be trusted on the issue of importing foreign mercenaries.\u201d\n\nBased on the claims by official sources that more than N4.27 trillion had been spent on defence in seven years, Afenifere lamented that in spite of this colossal sum, \u201cthe situation is getting worse by the day.\u201d\n\nAPC Leaders Fuelling Terrorism, PDP Tells El-Rufai\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the expression of frustration over the security situation and threats by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State to invite foreign mercenaries in the fight against terrorists was a further confirmation and admission of the failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in which he is a key player.\n\nThe PDP maintained that El-Rufai could not distance himself from those fuelling and aiding insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, PDP said the alarming insecurity in Nigeria that had led to the killing and maiming of tens of thousands of Nigerians since APC took office in 2015, was the result of the actions and comments by APC leaders and government officials, who encouraged acts of terrorism in the name of politics.\n\n\n\nPDP said Nigerians could still recall how in July 2021, El-Rufai, when asked why the federal government was lethargic in going after bandits, stated that the terrorists were collections of independent criminals for whom banditry was a business.\n\n\u201cNigerians can also recall how ahead of the 2019 general election, Governor El-Rufai threatened that, \u2018those that are calling for anyone to come and intervene in Nigeria, we are waiting for the persons that will come and intervene, they will go back in body bags.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party said the media was also awash with reports of how governors of APC-controlled states, especially, in the North-west, publicly romanced and empowered terrorists by paying them billions of naira of public funds in various hurried, uncoordinated, and hazy negotiations.\n\n\n\nPDP stated, \u201cNigerians have not forgotten how in November 2020 the Muhammadu Buhari presidency, through its spokesperson, Shehu Garba, rationalised the beheading of 43 rice farmers in Borno State by terrorists and blamed the farmers for not obtaining clearance before going to their farms.\n\n\u201cSuch comments and actions by Governor El-Rufai, the Buhari presidency, and other APC leaders have the propensity to embolden terrorists to unleash violence on innocent people, the results of which are now apparent and living with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur party challenges Governor El-Rufai and other APC leaders to speak out on the confession by a former APC leader that the terrorists pillaging our nation were brought in by APC leaders to rig the 2019 general election, but had remained in the country following the failure by the APC to pay them for the heinous \u2018services\u2019 they were contracted to provide against the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\n\n\nPDP said El-Rufai should know that he and other APC leaders could not under any circumstance distance themselves from blame in the worsening insecurity, pain, horror, social dislocation of families, and life-discounting experiences being encountered daily by Nigerians under the APC.\n\nPDP told El-Rufai that his suggestion or threats to import foreign mercenaries was counter-productive and capable of compounding the already dire security situation in the country.\n\n\n\nThe opposition party said it believed in the competence and capability of the country\u2019s gallant armed forces to defend Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, adding that the security agencies are only encumbered by manifest complicity, conspiracy, incompetence, and failure of the security command and control coordination structure of the APC administration.\n\n\n\nSeven of 11 Coaches Re-railed to Safety, as 80 Metres of Affected Rail Track Repaired\n\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) said it had re-railed seven out of the 11 coaches of the Abuja-Kaduna AK9 train, which was bombed last Monday by terrorists between Rijana and Rigasa, in Kaduna State. NRC also disclosed that 80 metres of the affected rail tracks had been repaired.\n\nIn a statement by its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Fidet Okhiria, NRC confirmed that four coaches (SP 00004, SP00009, SP00012 and SP00013) out of the 11 involved in the incident had been re-railed and safely moved to Rigasa Station, while work was on-going on the track repairs.\n\n\n\nOkhiria stated, \u201cWe did also state that 170 of the passengers onboard the train are safe while 21 passengers are reported missing. At the end of today\u2019s evening work, (02/04/2022), the NRC\u2019s restoration team has further re-railed four more coaches and two of the coaches (SP 00007 and SP 00013) had been safely moved to Idu and Rigasa stations, respectively. The other two coaches are still at the site due to damaged tracks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis brings the total coaches so far re-railed to seven, but only five successfully moved to the stations. However, efforts are on to linked the track, at the moment, a total of 80 meters of the affected section has been fixed, including replacement of affected sleepers and twisted rails.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe corporation also confirmed updates that a total of 172 passengers on board the AK9 are safe and okay while 21 passengers are still reported missing. Let us assure our esteem passengers that the corporation, in collaboration with the security agencies, will leave no stone unturned in our efforts at rescuing the missing persons.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss condoled with those who lost their loved ones and prayed for the repose of the lost souls. He also sympathised with the injured passengers and everyone onboard for the trauma the unfortunate incident had caused.\n\n\n\nOkhiria expressed gratitude to the security agencies, particularly, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air force, Nigeria Police, and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, for their support and cooperation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Again, OPEC fails to meet planned oil production volume in March\n\n*Crude records highest weekly slump in over 10 years\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho\n\nThe federal government is targeting to add 800,000 barrels to Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production from some important upstream projects being executed by Shell, TotalEnergies, and other oil companies, which had stalled due to funding and other reasons. Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Gbenga Komolafe, disclosed this in Abuja at the 2022 Oloibiri Lecture Series and Energy Forum (OLEF) organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Nigeria.\n\n\n\nRepresented at the occasion by his Special Technical Adviser, Mr. Abel Nsa, Komolafe listed some of the projects government was relying on to boost production to include TotalEnergies\u2019 Preowei project, Shell\u2019s Bonga South-west Aparo, and Bonga North projects, as well as other projects being executed by other companies.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome of these projects, including the Preowei project, the Bonga South West Aparo project, the Bonga North project, and a host of others, when completed, all have the combined capacity to add upwards of 800,000 BOPD to Nigeria\u2019s production figures.\u201d\n\n\n\nPreowei is a deep-water hydrocarbon pool located north of the Egina field in the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 130, off Nigeria. Discovered in 2003, Preowei has a subsea tank with over 150 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent and is expected to pump about 50,000 barrels of oil per day at peak.\n\nThe field development plan entails a subsea tie back to the Egina field Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility\n\n\n\nFinal Investment Decision (FID) on Preowei was fixed for fourth quarter of 2020, but was stalled following the suspension of the project same year by TotalEnergies due to COVID-19 constraints, concerns around new fiscal provisions in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector, as well as the collapse of oil prices at the time.\n\n\n\nShell\u2019s Bonga South West FPSO, with the capacity to pump 150,000 barrels per day, is another project government is relying on to boost daily oil production by 800,000 barrels. Bonga South-west was planned to add around one billion barrels to Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves.\n\n\n\nHowever, in February, the contract for the development of the FPSO unit for Bonga South-west was delayed, as the tendering process was put on hold till 2024.\n\n\n\nBonga, Nigeria\u2019s first deep-water oil field, currently has the capacity to produce 225,000 b/d of crude oil and 150 MMcf/d of gas, which feeds the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) plant at Bonny.\n\nShell had previously said it would develop the Bonga South-west project across three phases with a total potential yield of 3.2 billion barrels.\n\n\n\nDeveloping the Bonga South-west would cost $10 billion, according to estimates by NNPC, the concessionaire of the field.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of Bonga South-west\u2019s resources are located in OML 118, but it also extends into OMLs 132 and 140, operated by US major Chevron, where it is called Aparo. Other partners in the project are France\u2019s TotalEnergies and Italy\u2019s Eni.\n\n\n\nNigeria has been grossly underperforming in oil production, with Africa\u2019s largest oil producer failing to meet its production quota by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for many months running.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s 37 billion oil reserve, its production hovered abysmally low at 1.5 million per day, against the country\u2019s normal 2.2 million bpd capacity.\n\n\n\nThe poor production performance had been blamed on multiplicity of factors, including massive oil theft, non-starting of oil platforms, underinvestment, and divestment by the international oil companies (IOCs).\n\n\n\nKomolafe noted that with the commission now empowered by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the government could embark on the projects. To meet the increasing global energy demand, he said the federal government was set to embark on further exploration, adding that government also plans to embark on development drilling in its bid to optimise reservoir extraction.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe federal government is also ready to drill into new targets and employ technological advances to increase production outputs for appropriate energy mix,\u201d the NURPC boss stated.\n\nAgain, OPEC Fails to Meet Planned Oil Production Volume in March\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, failed to achieve their target crude oil production, despite the modest volume it was scheduled to release in March, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe oil producers\u2019 group only succeeded in adding 90,000 barrels per day of its planned additional 400,000 barrels per day, with only Saudi Arabia, and its neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, significantly increasing production during the month.\n\n\n\nMany other member nations, such as Nigeria, pumped well below quota mainly due to declining investment and operational disruptions, which had eroded their capacity for some time.\n\nOPEC had consistently rejected requests for an increase in production, even as the Russian invasion of Ukraine shook markets and boosted prices to $139 per barrel a few weeks ago. The group insisted that it will stick to the regime of careful increases in supply agreed last year.\n\n\n\nAlthough the cartel\u2019s operations data for each month, popularly called the Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), had yet to be released for April, covering activities for March, a secondary survey by Bloomberg revealed that the 13 members of OPEC produced an average of 28.6 million barrels per day during the month.\n\n\n\nThe figures are based on ship tracking data, information from officials and estimates from consultants, such as Rystad Energy AS and JBC Energy GmbH, which represent sources, other than those directly released by OPEC.\n\nAfter its meeting last week, the cartel raised Nigeria\u2019s production quota from April\u2019s 1.735 million barrels per day to 1.753 million barrels per day in May, even though the country has been struggling to meet lower production allocations.\n\n\n\nThe country has been constrained in meeting its OPEC quota for months, and as at the last production circle had as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to theft, ageing upstream infrastructure, and sabotage, as well as technical reasons.\n\n\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels per day output allowed by the oil producers, the country had managed to increase production to about 1.4 million bpd, the highest in recent times, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nFor Nigeria, while production challenges remain, the country\u2019s rig count was up by two in February, pushing it to eight from the initial six.\n\n\n\nAfter piling pressure on the cartel to increase supply for months without success, the United States and its allies have also decided to release at least 1 million barrels per day into the market to tame rising prices.\n\n\n\nThe Sanusi Barkindo-led group has, however, objected to the request to pump more oil, insisting that markets are not yet experiencing shortages and there is a balance between demand and supply at the moment.\n\nAccording to the group, whatever is happening in the market, like the Russia-Ukraine war, are extraneous to its activities.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, oil posted its biggest weekly loss in more than 10 years after the Joe Biden administration ordered an unprecedented release of US strategic reserves to tame rampaging prices.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate dropped one per cent early Saturday and over $14 this week, the most since 2011 as the US plans to release 1 million barrels a day for six months.\n\n\n\nMembers of the International Energy Agency (IEA) also agreed to release another round of crude stockpiles, with volumes to be decided later, although the US expects them to release an additional 30 million to 50 million barrels.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision follows rocketing gasoline prices in America and concerns about supply shortages following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The war has roiled global commodity markets and driven up the price of everything from fuels to food.\n\n\n\nIt has also led to tumultuous trading in oil, with massive intraday swings throughout March. WTI for May delivery fell $1.01 to settle at $99.27 a barrel while Brent for June settlement fell 32 cents to settle at $104.39 a barrel.\n\nThe U.S. already tapped its reserves twice in the past six months, but that has done little to cool prices.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s giant oil release contrasts sharply with OPEC+, which on Thursday ratified a planned, modest production increase of about 430,000 barrels a day.\n\n\n\nContributing to the week\u2019s slide, also, were concerns about Chinese demand as the world\u2019s biggest oil importer implements a series of lockdowns to curb a resurgence of COVID-19.\n\nAdded to that, in spite of pressure from the European Union (EU) for Nigeria to ramp up its gas production, it has been unable to do so, as it neither has the funding nor the infrastructure. Russia produces up to 40 per cent of Europe\u2019s total gas consumption.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nIndigenes of Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu state, resident in Abuja have urged Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to use his good office to address what they called the perennial marginalization of the area in the politics of the state.\n\n\n\nAddressing a press conference Sunday in Abuja, they called on the governor to, before leaving office, prevail on their neighboring Igbo-Etiti local government council to respect the zoning agreement reached in 1999 for the House of Representatives seat to rotate between Uzo-Uwani and Igbo-Etiti.\n\n\n\nThe President, Uzo-Uwani Professionals Association, UZPA, Ambassador Jonathan Eze said the political domination of his people in fragrant negligence of existing zoning agreement was no longer acceptable, noting that it has become necessary for the people to speak up, with the 2023 general election some few months away.\n\nAccording to him, Enugu zone since 1999 has continued to marginalize Nsukka axis, both in the production of governors as well as location of critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cWe ask our governor, whom we know believes and serves God fervently, and who knows that there is a God of justice, to throw his considerable political weight behind Uzo-Uwani to produce the House of Reps member for Uzo-Uwani/Igbo Etiti Federal Constituency.\n\n\n\n\u201cEnugu state as it is today was created out of Anambra state in 1991. The old Anambra state had five zones delineated according to their population and considerations of constituency delimitation. The five zones were Onitsha, Awka, Nsukka, Enugu and Abakaliki. It was upon this five-zone configuration that the general elections of 1979 and 1983 were conducted in the then Anambra state. So, when in 1991, Enugu state was created out of Anambra state, Onitsha and Awka zones became the new Anambra state, while Nsukka, Enugu and Abakaliki zones became the new Enugu ztate.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 1996, Abakaliki zone of Enugu state was carved out to fuse with Afikpo zone of Abia state to become Ebonyi state. This left, in Enugu state, Nsukka zone and Enugu zone. It is to be noted that Nsukka zone in this configuration, had about 53 per cent of the population and over 60 per cent of the land mass.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is to be remembered that a son of Isi-Uzo Local Government, Chief Isaiah Ani was the Senator who represented Nsukka zone in the Senate between 1979 -1983. The logic of dragging Isi-Uzo into Enugu zone was confounding. In effect, Enugu zone became two Senatorial zones with five federal constituencies while Nsukka maintained its sole Senatorial zone with three federal constituencies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis subterfuge resulted that since the return of democracy in 1999, Enugu zone has produced two governors in Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani (1999-2007) and Mr. Sullivan Chime (2007-2015), both of whom did an unbroken 16 years at the helm as governors of Enugu state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reality of this is the preponderance of infrastructure and developments concentrated in Enugu zone. Federal and state infrastructure that should have been shared half and half alike is now, if ever, shared, two to one. Since the return of democracy in 1999, Enugu zone has produced all the Ministers from Enugu state. Even what is due to Nsukka zone is still forcibly yanked away and sited in Enugu zone.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn what appeared an attempt at justifying the people\u2019s call for Ugwuanyi\u2019s intervention, UZPA, argued that \u201ca campus of Enugu state University of Science and Technology, in compliance with the original intendment of a multi-Campus structure of the University at design, that was sited in Adada \u2013 Nkpologu, in Uzo-Uwani Local Government was forcefully yanked away and relocated to Agbani, in Nkanu West of Enugu zone. Apart from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, UNN, which Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe mercifully sited in Nsukka, no other federal presence of note is in Nsukka. And even at that, all the prime faculties and Departments of the University, Medicine, Medical Lab, Law, Business, Accounting, Estate Management, Architecture are all in Enugu, leaving Nsukka campus with only Arts and Education.\n\n\n\n\u201cNsukka does not have a single tertiary hospital to receive referrals from primary and secondary health facilities, resulting in avoidable deaths witnessed as the patient is being transported to Enugu. Although UNN is in Nsukka, but the university teaching hospital is in Ituku Ozara, in Nkanu, in Enugu zone. Psychiatric hospital, Orthopeadic hospital, Dental School is all in Enugu zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, from Nsukka zone who started in 2015 will complete eight years as governor in 2023. On the basis that Enugu zone did 16 years, we ask that Nsukka zone be allowed to complete its 16 years as governor. When we agree that Nsukka should have a shot at it for another eight years to balance the equation, we would then micro zone to peripheral local governments who have been grossly shortchanged in the political tapestry of Enugu state, local governments like Uzo-Uwani and Isi-Uzo, in that order. That is our position on that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also justified UZPA\u2019s demand for a shot at the Uzo-Uwani/Igbo-Etiti federal constituency seat saying, \u201cSince 1999, when democracy returned, to 2023 when the term of the current occupant will expire, there are 24 years. Out of these 24 years, Igbo-Etiti has taken the position of member, House of Representatives for Uzo-Uwani/Igbo-Etiti Federal Constituency for 20 years. Uzo-Uwani has gone for a miserable four years. In percentage terms, Igbo-Etiti has done 83% of the time and Uzo Uwani, a mere 17%, for a position the two local governments are supposed to share 50 per cent apiece, despite a signed agreement to rotate the position between the two sisterly local governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, there should be no question as to which Local Government Area between Uzo-Uwani and Igbo-Etiti should be nominated to represent the constituency in the House in 2023. It is so obvious that what Igbo-Etiti is doing to Uzo-Uwani is a political overkill. But we hear that many of our Igbo-Etiti brothers and sisters, including the incumbent, who is from Igbo-Etiti and who has done two terms, are aspiring to return and for Igbo-Etiti to continue. Is that fair?,\u201d he asked.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We hope that western powers have learnt from the long failures of appeasement, and the obvious duplicity and inhumanity of Vladimir Putin. This is the most important declaration I have ever signed.

We must expose the truth. We must hold them to account in a court of law.

          "title": "BREAKING: 40 Ukrainian Civil Society Groups Sign Kyiv Declaration, Issue Six Appeals To World Leaders",
          "text": "As the Russia-Ukraine crisis rages on, 40 Ukrainian civil society organisations have issued the Kyiv Declaration, putting six urgent appeals before the international community.\n\n\n\nCoordinating via encrypted apps, and face to face in underground shelters, signatories include the Ukrainian Helsinki Group for Human Rights, Come Back Alive, Ukraine Crisis Media Centre and Women's Perspectives.\n\nThe CSOs are calling on the world to act now by standing with Ukraine.\n\nFrom establishing safe zones to provide sanctuary for civilians, to providing air defence systems and anti-tank weaponry, the Kyiv Declaration sets out six humanitarian and military needs of a country under attack.\n\n\n\nLyubov Maksymovych, Chair of Women's Perspectives, said: \u201cWe are issuing this declaration on behalf of Ukrainian women and men who stand together to fight for their liberty and freedoms.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt this moment, it\u2019s not too late to draw a line in the sand, here in Ukraine rather than through the centre of Europe - which is what will happen if we fail. We hope that western powers have learnt from the long failures of appeasement, and the obvious duplicity and inhumanity of Vladimir Putin. This is the most important declaration I have ever signed. If it is not answered, it could also be my last.\u201d\n\nSee Also International Ukraine: Putin Puts Russia's Nuclear Forces On High Alert, Increases Readiness To Launch\n\nOlga Aivazovska, Chair of Elections Watchdog, Opora, said: \u201cNow is the moment the world must demonstrate its support not only for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, but also for the values of democracy, human rights and freedom. With the Kyiv declaration, we ask for your help in defeating an autocratic dictator to defend not only Ukraine but the whole democratic world and the principles it is founded on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, Oleksandr Pavlichenko, the Executive Director of Ukrainian Helsinki Group for Human Rights, said: \u201cVladimir Putin and his henchmen believe they are above the law, that they can get away with this bloodshed because the world needs their gas and oil.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must prove them wrong. We must expose the truth. We must hold them to account in a court of law. Our declaration calls for the documentation and prosecution of their war crimes - the slain civilians, murdered children, the bombing of peaceful cities. Vladimir Putin must answer for his crimes against the Ukrainian people.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Kyiv Declaration\n\nThe 40 Ukrainian civil society groups \u2013 \u201care asking the international community to stand with Ukraine by demanding the international community take the following actions.\u201d\n\n\n\nTheir appeals are to establish safe zones in Ukraine - To provide sanctuary for civilians from both air and ground attacks and to help prevent a tide of refugees fleeing to Europe; Provide immediate defensive military aid - including lethal and non-lethal assistance; Implement crippling sanctions to undermine Putin\u2019s war machine; Provide immediate humanitarian aid; Freeze the assets and revoke the visas of Putin\u2019s cronies, and Provide equipment to track war crimes immediately.\n\nThis six-point appeal has been signed by 40 Ukrainian civil society organisations in Kyiv and other cities under siege.\n\nThe organisations are:\n\n1.

          "text": "The bodies are strewn across the quiet tree-lined street in the town of Bucha as far as the eye can see.\n\nAll 20 are in civilian clothing, and all have their different poses in death. Some lie with sightless eyes staring at Ukraine's overcast sky, some lie face down on the tarmac.\n\nThree of them are tangled up in bicycles after taking their final ride, while others, with waxy skin, have fallen next to bullet-ridden and crushed cars.\n\nOne has his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth, and his Ukrainian passport left open beside his corpse, said AFP journalists who accessed the town.\n\nAnother lies next to a yellow hoarding spray-painted with happy and sad emojis and the words \"Live Fast\", Times of Malta reports.\n\nRussia's hasty retreat from its occupation of the region around Kyiv is revealing fresh devastation by the day.\n\n\"All these people were shot, killed, in the back of the head,\" mayor Anatoly Fedoruk told AFP.\n\nAnother 280 people have been buried in mass graves in Bucha while the bodies of whole families still lie in shot-up cars, he said.\n\nSurrounded by the pine forests that stretch up to Belarus, Bucha was a picture of sleepy suburbia northwest of the Ukrainian capital until the Russian invasion.\n\nA month of fierce battles in towns like Bucha and nearby Irpin prevented Moscow's forces from encircling Kyiv some 25 kilometres away.\n\nGaping holes from shell explosions can be seen in building after building, while crushed cars litter the streets, said the AFP team who reached Bucha after it had been closed off from the world for nearly a month.\n\nSupermarkets, cafes and houses are burnt or destroyed, a church roof was damaged. Only a McDonald's has seemingly escaped untouched.\n\nBodies lie randomly around the town: outside a railway station, by the side of a road.\n\nBut the violence that came to this one street appears to be more systematic.\n\nThe victims, all of whom appeared to be men, are scattered over several hundred metres of debris-strewn tarmac.\n\nSixteen of the 20 corpses were lying either on the pavement or by the verge. Three were sprawled in the middle of the road, and another lay on his side in the courtyard of a destroyed house\n\nSome lie in groups, like the two men lying face up in a puddle next to each other, one in a green parka and the other in a black jacket.\n\nOthers died alone. The cyclist with orange gloves and a black balaclava lying on his side with his bike on top of him, as if he has fallen and cannot get back up.\n\nAll were wearing civilian clothes - winter coats, jackets or tracksuit tops, jeans or jogging bottoms, and trainers or boots.\n\nViolence is everywhere: a silver car is covered with bullet holes, another is partly crushed, while a burned-out van lies near one group of bodies.\n\n\"These are the consequences of Russian occupation,\" says the mayor.\n\nYet the horrors of war have become so routine in Bucha that the remaining residents walk down the street past the bodies, barely casting a glance.\n\nUkrainian forces have only just secured Bucha and started their first aid deliveries on Saturday, so the dead must lie unburied for a while longer.\n\nSoldiers hand out food and medicine to desperate survivors from the back of a green military truck. Another body lies under a sheet about 100 metres away.\n\nIt is the first such delivery in more than a month, after Ukraine said Saturday that Russian forces were making a \"rapid retreat\" from Kyiv.\n\n\"They are running,\" says Yuriy Biriukov, a senior member of Ukraine's volunteer territorial defence squad overseeing the aid operation.\n\nBucha's residents were \"still very afraid, still shocked\", he added.\n\n\"Regular civilians cannot even imagine the conditions in which they lived during this one month, with artillery, without the supply of food and water, without any possibility to get out.\"\n\nOne resident showed AFP what he said was a grave, topped with a green wooden cross, in the back garden of a neighbouring house where four people including a child were buried.\n\nThe people who have stayed in Bucha are mostly elderly.",

          "text": "In Nigeria, pharmaceutical stores are the first point of contact for many people. It has become a norm for many Nigerians to think it is appropriate to consider the pharmacist\u2019s prescription before going to a hospital or primary healthcare. The pharmaceutical sector is one integral part of the health sector that needs attention in the areas of service delivery as well as the product standard. According to a report by McKinsey and Company, the pharmaceutical market could grow as high as 9 percent annually by 2025, contributing between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion to pharma sales growth, 55 percent of it from the prescription of drugs.\n\nIn this interview with TheCable\u2019s BUSOLA ARO, Samuel Okwuada, chief executive officer of Remedial Health, talks about the changing world of the medical and pharmaceutical industry, substandard products and the role of health tech in bridging pharmaceutical gaps in rural areas.\n\nTheCable: What inspired this business model?\n\nOkwuada: Remedial Health was established out of the desire to promote and revamp the pharmaceutical industry as well as the healthcare services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, urban pharmacists have no details about you. They have no data to help them know if you react to a particular medication\u2026 and it is a big risk. The pharmacist does have to verify the medications you are currently on or ask about the possibility that you take medications that you are not supposed to.\n\nTheCable: Tell us about Remedial\u2019s digitalisation approach to health tech\n\nOkwuada: With the rising move of digitisation and growth in technology, the medical community is not to be left lagging, hence the need for patients\u2019 medication records (PMR).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates 100,000 deaths a year in Africa are linked to the counterfeit drug trade and over 30 percent of medicines sold in Africa are counterfeit. Remedial Health is fixing this, starting with Nigeria.\n\nThe platform helps pharmacies and proprietary patent medicine vendors (PPMVs) to manage the day to day records, store patient medication records, patient communications, stock management, order processing, reporting and accounting to support more effective and efficient patient care.\n\nThe fact that pharmacists are the first-stop-place most patients visit before speaking with a doctor gives more reasons for the pharmaceutical sector is to be revamped.\n\nAll products are vetted before distribution to verify authenticity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe platform also enables Remedial Health to provide consolidated, real-time data on market behaviour to manufacturers for increased profitability and better decision-making across the value chain.\n\nTheCable: How do people without the technical know-how or tech knowledge tap into this platform?\n\nOkwuada: We are not at a loss as to the location that we are in, which is Africa, Nigeria to be precise, not everyone is tech-savvy, not everyone knows how to operate the computer, and that is why we then have the procurement platform separate from the patient\u2019s medical record (PMR).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe platform is a mobile app, and anyone with a smartphone can use it.\n\nTheCable: What is your take on substandard drug products, and how can Nigeria eradicate them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkwuada: The issue of substandard products is rampant in Nigeria. The best practice is to either get from the manufacturers or the authorised distributors in Nigeria. Some pharmacists get theirs from other sources, thereby inflating the prices by 200 percent. Before we bring a manufacturer on board, we do background checks and ensure they are genuine.\n\nThere is an utmost need to also ensure that the medicines obtained from any manufacturer or distributor are up to date and certified by WHO. So we are sure that the medicine we get is up to standard, then we supply directly to pharmacists and hospitals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: What policy do you think the government should fix for effective health care?\n\nOkwuada: The level of structure in the healthcare service amplifies the need to consider basic policies to be put in place by the government.\n\nPolicies such as an increase in salaries, better working conditions, not just for the doctors and nurses but also for patients, and improve facilities are crucial in any society. We need to make our health sectors easier and more profitable for private investors to invest in the public health sector.\n\nThe government alone can not do it all.\n\nPrivate investors who are profit-driven will ensure that the services provided are top-notch. Another policy to be put in place is national health insurance by making sure that every Nigerian is covered with national health insurance and a portion of corporate and personal taxes goes into funding it. That will help our health sector a lot.\n\nTheCable: What top tips would you give aspiring startups to harness technology with their businesses?\n\nOkwuada: Startups and businesses need to focus on scaling up the business and delivering value before introducing tech, especially for offline-online businesses.\n\nSo I would advise that they be resilient and persistent. Starting a business in Nigeria is tough, and you have to be ready to face it head-on.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "13 years, $10bn processed. How has Paga evolved over the years?",
          "text": "During a chat at the company\u2019s head office in Yaba, a suburb on Lagos Mainland once touted as Nigeria\u2019s Silicon Valley, CEO Tayo Oviosu recalls the epiphany moment that led to the founding of Paga back in April 2009.\n\nThe Stanford-educated Oviosu had just returned to the country he was born and raised in but left at age 16 and wanted to venture into the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nOpportunities in the private sector at the time were immense. Nigeria\u2019s central bank was pushing for a cashless economy but banks were slow to innovate. After considering several ideas for a couple of months, Oviosu came up with what is now Paga.\n\n\u201cBack then, a lot of transactions in Nigeria were largely cash-dependent which was inefficient for both businesses and individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cPaga was born out of my own frustration with carrying cash around. The idea was simple\u2014there had to be a way to make payments simpler.\u201d\n\nOviosu, aiming to build the \u201cPaypal for Africa\u201d, then teamed up with Jay Alabraba to launch a mobile payments company named Paga, a Spanish word that means \u201cto pay\u201d.\n\nPaga was arguably the first fintech company in Nigeria to popularise mobile money among the unbanked. At the time it was launched, the main players bridging payments with mobile technology in Nigeria were Interswitch, eTranzact, and SystemSpec\u2019s Remita.\n\nThirteen years on, Paga\u2014now a UK-headquartered Group\u2014has amassed more than 19 million unique users through its consumer channel and agent network of over 120,000 agents across Nigeria. Since the company began commercial operations in 2012, it\u2019s processed over $10 billion ( \u20a64 trillion).\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Oviosu reflects on Paga\u2019s evolution and growth and talks about product innovation, global expansion, and the next phase for both Paga and the fintech landscape in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDigitising consumer payments\n\nOviosu\u2019s goal for Paga was to build a platform that simplified payments, digitised cash transactions, and delivered financial services to the mass market. He started with a team of 8, a figure that\u2019s grown to more than 100.\n\nPaga\u2019s initial set of products was focused on providing more people access to traditional banking services \u2013 especially sending and receiving money \u2013 through mobile phones and physical agents equipped with POS devices. At an agent outlet, customers show up without an account number and for a fee, are able to send and receive money to anyone.\n\nIn December 2019, after the introduction of national identity numbers (NIN) and bank verification numbers (BVN), Paga launched its consumer direct product that allowed users to create mobile accounts and used wallets for transactions through the mobile app and USSD.\n\nAccording to Oviosu, more than 3.7 million wallets have been created on Paga since then while the company plans to roll out physical and virtual cards later this year.\n\nA chart showing growth in Paga\u2019s TPV since its founded.

While it took the company 99 months to get to its first \u20a62 trillion, Oviosu revealed it took 22 months to reach the next \u20a62 trillion.\n\nIn 2021, Paga crossed the \u20a61 trillion mark in annual TPV for the first time\u2014hitting \u20a61.2 trillion\u2014and is on track to reach \u20a62 trillion this year alone, according to the CEO.\n\nAs part of its consumer payments play, Paga in February announced its addition as a payment provider for Twitter Tips, a feature that enables Twitter users to either send or receive by simply linking their preferred third-party payment service providers to their profiles.\n\nBeyond consumer payments, however, Paga is now a fintech behemoth helping merchants digitise payments (under a separate brand called Doroki) and opening up its infrastructure for third-party companies to easily offer financial services.\n\nPaga Group is a teenager today! What started out as a simple idea to make it simple to pay & get paid is now 3 business lines:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Consumer Payments \u2013 @paga\n\n\u2013 Embedded Finance \u2013 Paga PaaS https://t.co/AvGdBzElZ5\n\n\u2013 Seller/Merchant \u2013 @doroki_ng\n\n\n\nThanks to our amazing team \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/yC5Gv64kGm \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) April 3, 2022\n\nDoroki for merchants\n\nLast year, Paga launched Doroki, a separate unit within the Group that leverages Paga\u2019s payment infrastructure to help SMEs digitise payments.\n\nDoroki allows merchants to accept cards and other forms of digital payments via point-of-sale (POS) terminals and mobile POS handheld devices, making it easy for them to get paid and track inventory while enabling them to provide other value-added financial services to customers.\n\nWhile Covid-19 has increased the use of technology in payments and money transfers in Africa, the purchase and onboarding cost of POS devices is unaffordable for most merchants.\n\nPaga announced last year a partnership with Untapped Global to provide financing that would lower the cost of entry for merchants, with payments recovered from the revenues earned on the devices.\n\nAfter a successful pilot programme, which saw 2,000 businesses provided with financed POS devices, Oviosu revealed that more than 6,000 sellers currently now use Doroki to collect payments in the wake of the commercial launch last November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build an ecosystem for the consumer to conveniently make payments and for SMEs to manage their businesses and do payrolls,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nProduct infrastructure play\n\nFrom merely enabling Nigerians (individuals and businesses) to make and receive payments with ease, the Paga group now offers open-source APIs to companies for building products.\n\nPaga\u2019s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) business started with the acquisition of a remittance license in 2018, after which it allowed companies like Western Union and Wise to terminate remittances to accounts in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, Paga opened up its platform to more businesses through Collect APIs, which more than 200 businesses currently use.\n\nPaga\u2019s open wallet is available to any third-party developer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to compete with you building your wealth management app; we\u2019ll help you,\u201d the CEO said, adding that its recent integration with Flutterwave is built around the same APIs.\n\nThis wknd I experienced the power of Paga's Connect API \u2013 one-click payments \u2013 on @theflutterwave as I paid for my day 2 return covid test \ud83e\udd73\n\n\n\nI had previously linked my Paga acct to Flutterwave so going fwd it's super easy to pay on any website using Flutterwave!@TechProd_Arch pic.twitter.com/6WJkFOvAWa \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) January 24, 2022\n\nIn effect, Paga has extended beyond the payments business to becoming a product infrastructure company, which entails entering into partnerships with tech companies in similar and adjacent sectors.\n\nPaga\u2019s Nigeria approach\n\nPaga\u2019s go-to-market strategy in Nigeria has been a hybrid approach that combines offline and online channels. \u201cA majority of the population may not be tech-savvy and smartphone penetration is still low,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nStarting out, Paga relied on a retail network of shops and agents that consumers can visit for in-person transactions. \u201cTo scale in Africa, you need a hybrid (digital and physical) approach. If you don\u2019t want or know how to use the technology, you can go to agents and still deal in [physical] cash, but the agent can do the digital.\u201d\n\nOviosu acknowledges that in Nigeria, physical cash is very much still a thing and won\u2019t go away anytime soon. Smartphone penetration has also not improved significantly. Hence, the company \u201cstill needs on ramps & off ramps to cash\u201d.\n\nAlthough the share of Paga\u2019s total transactions being done via agents has declined in recent years.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, agents accounted for about 90% of our transactions. Last year, that figure fell to 60%, an indication that other channels/parts of the business are growing fast.\u201d\n\nA Paga paypoint in Lagos. Image credit: Tayo Oviosu/Twitter.\n\nWhat next for Paga? Expansion\n\n\u201cThe vision is still the same\u2014to solve payments for individuals and businesses,\u201d Oviosu said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken an open approach. It\u2019s not a closed circle.\u201d\n\nOn what an \u201copen approach\u201d means, the CEO explained that with Paga, users can link their several bank accounts, debit cards, and mobile money wallets from other providers.\n\nIn addition, anybody\u2014including non-Paga account holders\u2014can pay a Doroki merchant. \u201cYou can walk into a store and pay with your card, scan a QR code, or make payments using USSD from any bank.\u201d\n\nWhile the vision has been steady, the ambition and scope of Paga have grown over time.\n\nAlongside product expansion, Paga has in its sight a global expansion starting with Ethiopia. In January 2020, it acquired Apposit, an Ethiopian software development company that is planned to be its vehicle for entry into East Africa and Latin America. Last month, Paga announced an official launch in the Horn of Africa country.\n\nBecause there are local nuances to be aware of, Paga has a local team of at least 50 in Ethiopia. The payments platform was also built to be multilingual, so switching from one language to another is easy.\n\nAs per funding the expansion plans, Oviosu revealed Paga, which has secured $35 million to date\u2014with the backing of investors such as Jim O\u2019Neill and Tim Draper\u2014is looking to raise additional capital.\n\nTayo Oviosu, Paga co-founder and CEO.\n\nFintech innovation in Africa\n\nOn the next phase of innovation in Africa\u2019s fintech space, Oviosu expects new startups to build more solutions on existing infrastructure provided by older players like Paga, Flutterwave, Paystack, etc. to solve key problems.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of years of Paga was building infrastructure where it didn\u2019t exist. We built a hybrid payment infrastructure for the online and offline customer,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cNew companies don\u2019t need to repeat that. I expect to see more of them focusing on niche markets that can scale, leveraging existing platforms through open-source APIs.\u201d\n\nAs for Paga, the vision remains the same: getting up to one billion people using its platform to access and use money, according to Oviosu.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peace Itimi: From Nigeria to the UK in search of peace",
          "text": "Peace Itimi has spent 9 months away from Nigeria but doesn\u2019t miss the country. She misses her cleaner and cook, though, because, in London, she doesn\u2019t have a cleaner and cook. But she at least has peace of mind.\n\nWhen Itimi started working remotely from Nigeria, she promised herself she would stay in Nigeria, until the Lekki toll gate killing\u2014where tens of #EndSARS protesters, who were protesting against police brutality, were killed\u2014scared her out of her wits. \u201cI felt unsafe,\u201d she recalled. It was then she started to reconsider her stance on immigration and realised money won\u2019t shield her from how unsafe Nigeria was increasingly becoming.\n\nA friend gave her the nudge to leave the country, recommending that she go through the Tech Nation Visa\u2014a visa that allows tech talent across the world to live and work in the UK\u2014because, he felt, she was a good fit. In 2021, she started researching the programme, and even though she felt the requirements were scary, she realised that everything she had done up until that point made her a perfect fit.\n\nFinding different loves\n\nItimi grew up in Benin City, Edo state, and studied medical biochemistry at Delta State University. She fell in love with digital marketing while in university. She said university had been one of the most definitive phases of her life because it was where she found God, found herself, and digital marketing.\n\nWhen she became a Google Student Ambassador, she started training other students in digital marketing in school. Fresh from school, she launched a digital marketing agency with a friend in 2016.\n\nShe moved to Lagos in February 2017 to begin her national service year at digital marketing agency, Webcoupers, and that was where she officially launched her career. In 2018, she joined Wild Fusion, another digital marketing agency, where she trained people on digital marketing, branding, Google Ads, and SEO. She, in that same year, also organised training on behalf of Facebook, Orange Academy, and the British Council.\n\nDuring one of her travels for digital marketing training in Accra, she realised that even though she loved travelling, her physical reach was limited. \u201cI can\u2019t train people in Accra except when I travel to Accra. So, I started thinking that a way to break that divide was to start training people online and that means I can reach anybody anywhere, so long as they can find my content.\u201d\n\nSo, Itimi started a YouTube channel in December 2018 where she initially shared marketing tips and random lessons about life, before launching a now-popular segment called Founders Connect, where she has interviewed about 40 African founders, including Odun Eweniyi of Piggyvest, Atsu Davoh of Bitsika, and Ezra Olubi of Paystack.\n\nIn 2019, she entered the Nigerian tech ecosystem after landing a role as the Head of Marketing at fintech company, Korapay, before moving to Venture Capital (VC) firm, Seedstars in 2020.\n\nFirst comes loneliness\n\nIn the first few months after Itimi arrived in the UK last June, she felt lonely. She had never been so far away from home before; the farthest she had travelled had been within the continent, to Cape Verde, in 2019.\n\nEverything was new to her in the UK. For example, the summer was warm yet she still felt cold. She couldn\u2019t see clearly and had migraines when she went outside without sunshades. It also took her a while to adjust to the predominant use of contactless payment in London.\n\nAs an introvert, making friends was initially difficult for her, even though she didn\u2019t face this difficulty back home. In Lagos, she was mildly popular so people started conversations with her at events. Now in the UK, she decided to become more intentional about making friends and connecting with people by starting conversations. When she sees someone on social media she wants to connect with, she reaches out and asks them to have a coffee or jump on an informal call with her. \u201cI am learning that a new environment and country requires an improved me. I have to do extra work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what this means for her is that she has to move past her introverted nature and social anxiety because to live the life she wants she must connect with people, build a network, and make impact in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, she made more friends when she joined a cycling community of about 20 other immigrants and her friends for whom she had reviewed the Tech Nation Visa applications joined her in the UK. On top of that, on the back of her YouTube video where she shared her experience with the visa application, at least 20 people have reached out to tell her they had got the visa.\n\nLondon, the good and the bad\n\nShe currently works remotely as Head of Growth for offline fintech app, Stax and admits that her productivity has increased since she moved. \u201cI don\u2019t apologise for bad internet anymore. I don\u2019t have to worry about electricity, either. I can afford to leave my laptop unplugged.\u201d\n\nItimi is excited about the travelling opportunities London presents; she feels more confident applying for visas for different countries now than she ever was in Nigeria. London has the most connected flights anywhere in the world and they are relatively cheaper.\n\n\u201cWhen I travelled to Kenya from London, in February, my flight cost less than a flight from Lagos to Kenya.\u201d\n\nOne thing Itimi likes about London is its diversity\u2014in people, food, and even the hobbies she can choose from. She is also in love with its efficient transport infrastructure: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exceed the time I estimate to get to my destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this exposure to working infrastructure and this level of diversity is doing something to my mind that I will be grateful for in a couple of years because of how I would have grown as a person.\u201d\n\nShe also loves the feeling of freedom in the city, which allows people to be themselves. \u201cFor instance, I feel like my confidence in the way I dress has increased a lot since I moved to London, compared to when I was in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t like the weather. During the winter, she rarely left her house, and when she did, her multiple layers of clothing didn\u2019t stop the cold from getting to her and the wind from threatening to blow her over. She looks forward to the summer, which she prefers.\n\nMaybe higher up on the list of things she doesn\u2019t like are taxes, because there are a lot of them. \u201cI feel like if I thought too much about my taxes I probably would not have moved when I did; I would have waited a bit longer to save more money in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Stax is levelling the playing field between USSD and bank apps",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax is a startup that takes banking with Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) from the phone dialler to an offline mobile application that gives offline banking a better user experience.\n\nPer Stax\u2019s blog, USSD has been around for 24-years and has mostly been used by telcos to facilitate communication with their customers. For example, telcos have a USSD code that usually starts with * and ends with # to check airtime balance or buy data.\n\nAccording to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), nine in 10 mobile money transactions in sub-Saharan Africa are done through USSD.\n\nInterestingly, the technology is the product of the GSM 02.90 document created by engineers at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), a body formed by the European Union in 1988 to harmonise and standardise communication technology in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2018 Quartz Africa article, the document had a protocol designed to facilitate communication between telcos and their subscribers. However, telcos needed a protocol and initiated machine-to-machine communication where the subscriber\u2019s mobile phone would simply query the network and get a response instantly.\n\nOver the years, USSD has gone from aiding network and subscriber communication to being used for several other applications, including banking. Interestingly, the USSD protocol has not had any major upgrade since its introduction.\n\nHow is Stax using USSD differently?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax is harmonising USSDs and making them simpler to use. Instead, of dialling *123# and following the instructions to send money or buy airtime, Stax is bringing all the USSD codes under one roof.\n\nIt is doing this with a USSD app that automates transactions and saves you the hassle of remembering codes and putting data in dialogue boxes as fast as possible, so you don\u2019t get an error message.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Stax Co-founder and CEO, Ben Lyon, explained that the startup is trying to make USSD better and \u201cfind a way to give smartphone users a way to leverage the best parts of USSD.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lyon, the best part of USSD is that it works offline; its bad part, however, is that it has an awful user experience.\n\nUSSD works with a smartphone or basic feature phone\u2019s dialler. For example, to complete a bank transaction, you dial the bank\u2019s USSD code and follow the instructions in the pop-up\u2019s interactive menus.\n\nThese menus are timed, so inputting data such as an account number or personal identification number (PIN) has to be done swiftly, or you\u2019ll get an error message and start again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has never been significant innovation around USSD because the Internet took its place in developed nations. A high level of Internet penetration and the rapid development of smartphones and computers made USSD redundant.\n\nInternet penetration in Africa, on the other hand, is slow. In 2000, Internet penetration among adults in the US was 52%, significantly higher than Africa\u2019s 0.5%.\n\nWhile developed countries did not need USSD, it was important to Africa, and it moved from being a way for telcos to communicate with customers to a major tool for financial inclusion.\n\nUsing USSD seamlessly on smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Lyon, Ceo, Stax\n\n\u201cIs there a way we can screenscrape USSD?\u201d That was the question that set the pattern for what Stax is doing today \u2014 navigating USSD menus on behalf of end-users in the background of an Android application.\n\nAccording to Lyon, the startup started out by selling the solution to other developers under the company name Hover, Stax\u2019s parent company. However, the business model did not generate the anticipated revenue, and Stax was created in 2020 as a consumer-facing version of Hover.\n\nLyon described Stax as an online payment super app for Africa that brings together all USSD based services in one place.\n\nHow does Stax work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax website\n\nTypically, when USSD is accessed through a phone dialler, you can get a session error if you do not type fast enough. What Stax does is run the USSD in the background and reduce the USSD menus to fewer taps within the app.\n\nThe Stax app works almost like any bank app, but offline. Unlike bank apps, it requires less information which makes setting it up straightforward. It, however, requires permission to manage phone calls and read messages.\n\nThe setup process is completed by selecting your bank(s). Sending money with Stax can be completed in a few taps by selecting the sending and receiving banks and the amount to transfer.\n\nIt becomes evident that the app is running a USSD protocol when it asks which SIM card you\u2019d like to complete the process with. Besides that, the process is just as seamless as using an online bank app.\n\n\u201cI compare USSD to the early Internet,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cIt is like asking people to interact with the web without a browser, going to IP addresses directly instead of websites.\u201d\n\nWith Stax improving the USSD user experience on smartphones, its market is limited to just smartphone users, but according to Lyon, this is still a huge number.\n\nWhile one might assume that smartphone users will typically prefer to perform transactions over the Internet rather than USSD, data by GSMA reveals that although smartphones outnumber feature phones in sub-SaharanSaharan Africa, USSD remains the most popular form of banking.\n\nIn 2019, there were one billion mobile money accounts in sub-Saharan Africa, and over $1.9 billion was processed daily.\n\nHow Stax makes money\n\nFree to use, Stax only takes a USSD telco session charge. It, therefore, becomes difficult to see how the company makes money from its solution.\n\nRevealing Stax\u2019s revenue generation model, Lyon said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to start monetising in Kenya in the next few weeks. We\u2019re going to charge fees and commissions to businesses that sell to our users. So, when you buy airtime in Stax, we\u2019ll get a little commission from the seller.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, he said telcos work with dealers and distributors that buy wholesale airtime rates and sell to the subscribers. Stax\u2019s plan is to partner with these distributors and steer traffic to them while they get a cut.\n\nAlthough Stax has a monetisation plan, its feasibility can only be proven when it starts. The startup recently got a $2.2 million seed funding led by World Within Ventures and Noemis Ventures in March 2022, which Lyon said has been instrumental in growing the business.\n\nStax\u2019s plan goes beyond making existing services available via USSD better; it wants to make crypto services, among others, accessible through USSD.\n\nWill a 24-year-old technology continue to dominate in Africa? Only time will tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover. Twitter\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHola,\n\nIt\u2019s the start of a new work week, and I\u2019m meant to say something funny or uplifting here, but I have nothing. I\u2019ve got something else, though. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s about Twitter.\n\nSo, you know how you can co-author a post on Instagram with another user, Twitter says it\u2019s testing this feature, but you\u2019ll only be able to invite public accounts who follow you to co-author a tweet, and they\u2019ll have to accept your invitation.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u201cdue date\u201d yet, but like so many other beta features, we may or may not get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Today\u2019s Digest, we\u2019ll be discussing three very different stories:\n\nFantasy football in Africa\n\nMTN\u2019s contribution to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue, and\n\nWhat the Web3 is\n\nBetting on fantasy football in Africa\n\nAt the beginning of every football season, every person I know interested in the English Premier League \u2014 the biggest football league in the world (argue with your keypads) \u2014 starts talking about which players they\u2019re buying and what fantasy league they are joining.\n\nEven though I\u2019ve been a football fan for the last 13 years, I\u2019ve never understood the craze behind fantasy football. So imagine my surprise when I heard African football fantasy startup, Eksab had raised $3million in funding on Monday, March 28, 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s fantasy football, though? So, think of this as your average football league, complete with players, coaches, and everything that makes up the entire production, but this time, you\u2019re the coach, and you choose your players yourself. Each match week, you get points based on how your players perform. At the end of the season, the person with the highest points gets a prize.\n\nIt\u2019s a big deal in places like Europe and Asia, not so much in Africa. On the African continent, betting companies rule the roost, and you\u2019d often find football fans \u2014 this tag is arguable, in my opinion \u2014 placing bets on how teams play.\n\nBut what does a fantasy football startup raising money mean for the \u201cecosystem\u201d? How would this play out considering the dominance of betting companies in Africa? Chimgozirim and Bolu made some interesting findings, which they shared here: Fantasy sports in Africa: Can $3m funding make it popular?\n\nMTN\u2019s lion share taxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s go down a different path: On Saturday, April 2, 2022, news of telecom company, MTN\u2019s 13.5% contribution to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue hit the papers \u2014 or in most cases, screens.\n\nAccording to MTN, it paid \u20a6757 billion in taxes to all Nigerian government agencies in 2021 and \u20a6618.7 billion to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The company was also named the most tax-compliant company in Nigeria. An interesting u-turn from 2018 when the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, accused MTN of owing $2billion in taxes. This was eventually resolved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContributing 13.5% of the total taxes paid to the FIRS in a tax year is no mean feat and got our spidey senses tingling. So, Emmanuel and I decided to do a little calculation.\n\nThe FIRS says it collected \u20a66.4 trillion in taxes in 2021. After our calculations, it amounts to approximately 10%, instead of 13.5%; still not a bad number if you ask me. Interestingly, according to Premium Times, the tax collecting body refused to comment on the actual percentage.\n\nApart from this, however, is one crucial fact: MTN contributes double-digit percentages to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue. The implications of this are myriad. For one, this basically seals the telecoms giant\u2019s status in Nigeria. It could also mean that MTN leaving the country might have some interesting consequences.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and it should make for an interesting read.\n\nMaking sense of the Web3 buzz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably heard or seen the words \u2014 or abbreviations \u2014 Web3, NFTs, LFG, WAGMI and wondered what the evangelists were on about.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the \u201csimplest\u201d, Web3. It is said to be the next version of the Internet, which will focus on decentralisation and user ownership. So, unlike the current dispensation \u2014 Web2 \u2014 where many platforms are owned and regulated by one central entity, individuals in Web3 have more say in how their data or actions are controlled.\n\nTake Twitter, for example. Instead of having rules and regulations being set by the microblogging site, users can put possible policies to a vote and decide how they want to be regulated, kind of like democracy, but not.\n\nIn the last few months, Bolu has covered quite a bit on the space and, in a natural progression of events, hosted a Techpoint Twitter Spaces on Friday, April 1, 2022. We spoke to Chika Uwazie, Founder of Afropolitan; Erikan Obotetukudo, Founder of Audacity; and Clement Ugbo, Founder of Crevatal, to make sense of the Web3 buzz.\n\nHave a listen or if you want a read, you can check out this explainer: Web3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechpoint stories for you\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nSpent the weekend in the company of The Black Power Mixtape.

          "title": "More hardship ahead as energy, forex crisis worsens",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere are strong indications that the present level of economic hardship plaguing Nigerians may be a a childs play compared with what lies ahead if the twin problem of high cost of energy and scarcity of foreign exchange remain unabated.\n\nIncreasing number of makers and providers of essential goods and services are looking the way of imminent upward review of prices as the only option to remain in business and sustain the quality of their services to their customers in the face of spiraling cost of production.\n\nIn the past two months, skyrocketed prices of petrol, diesel, aviation fuel, kerosene, and cooking and industrial gas have conspired with acute power blackouts amid higher tariffs to destabilise business and social activities across the country.\n\nOperations of schools, households, hospitals, SMEs, transporters, and businesses are currently constrained by the steep rise in the cost of diesel, with a litre now selling at between N720 and N800 from N260 per litre in December 2021.\n\nWhile the federal government continues to argue that prices of diesel, aviation fuel, kerosene and gas have been deregulated, analysts say as long as the naira continues to decline and Nigeria imports these products, prices will not come down.\n\nOn the international front, the prices of oil and gas have risen sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. From under $80 per barrel in December, a barrel climbed to $130pb before decreasing 32 cents, or 0.3 percent to $104.39 a barrel on Friday after members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) agreed to join in the largest-ever United States oil reserves release.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had announced a release of one million barrels per day of crude oil for six months from May, which at 180 million barrels is the largest release ever from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).\n\nAlthough the 2022 Budget benchmark for oil is $62pb, Nigeria is a major loser for failing to revive its four moribund refineries with installed capacity of 445,000 barrels per day. Despite being a major oil and gas producing country, Nigeria as a net importer of refined petroleum products, uses up huge resources to fund imports, with the national currency losing value daily.\n\nAccording to the 2021 report of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) , Nigeria exported petroleum products worth $27.73 billion in 2020, but imported refined imports worth $71.28 billion, leaving a huge deficit of $43.56 billion.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance says the government pays N150 billion monthly on petrol subsidies while other estimates put the figure at $7 billion annually.\n\nScampering for safety\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) whose members spend N100 billion monthly on alternative energy sources that add 40 per cent to costs, said, The direct implication of this trend is that Nigerians will feel the heat, as it is reflective through the high cost of goods in the market owing to the high cost of production.\n\nFew days ago, bakers under the aegis of the Premium Bread-Makers Association of Nigeria (PBAN) said a harsh business environment triggered by rising energy costs and increasing forex rates has caused some of their members across the country to shut down their business operations.\n\nPBAN President, Emmanuel Onuorah, expressed concerns over what he called the lackluster attitude of the government towards addressing the harsh operating environment faced by businesses.\n\nHe said, Companies are shutting down their businesses as a result of the increase in the price of diesel. Some of my members shut down (their business premises) again this week. So many other companies are closing down.\n\nAs we speak, operators in the sachet water business segment are on strike. Theyll likely increase the price of sachet water to N25 or N30. We dont even know where this thing is tending towards. Bigger companies are closing because of operating costs. Businesses are going under.\n\nOnuorah revealed that wheat suppliers have suggested a possible scarcity of the product within the next two weeks, indicating that the price of bread may go up significantly.\n\nHospitals now have to ration diesel. Energy is the key. We understand that in two weeks time, there will be a scarcity of wheat and the millers will raise their prices to N30,000 or N40,000, he added.\n\nAlso, telecommunications services providers under the aegis of the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), have said a tariff review for telcos services may happen if the rise in the price of diesel is sustained.\n\n\u201cWe are actually in a very bad situation. And how this will play in end-user pricing requires us to follow the right channel, the regulatory procedure for conveying our complaint to the regulator,\u201d ALTON Chairman, Gbenga Adebayo, said.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, telcos will continue to ensure that there are no service disruptions in the nation. However, he added that there might be a need for a tariff review if the present diesel crisis persists.\n\n\u201cThe diesel situation is a problem at this time. We are doing all that we can to ensure the business continues as usual in all cases every other circumstance,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\n\u201cThe assurance for the public is that there would not be a time of outage because of the current diesel crisis. What I cannot assure is that at some point there may not be a consideration for some form of tariff review. I cannot guarantee that it will not happen sometime in the near future. I cannot guarantee that.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate asked pay-TV service provider, Multichoice to reduce the prices of its DStv and GOtv packages owing to the prevailing economic circumstances of the country. Multichoice had penultimate week increased the prices of its DStv and GOtv packages, citing inflation and rising cost of production.\n\n\u201cIn light of the rising costs of inflation and business operations, we have had to review the price of our packages to keep delighting our customers with great entertainment, anytime and anywhere,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe resolution of the upper legislative chamber followed a motion sponsored by Abba Moro, senator representing Benue south.\n\nNigerians are demanding that, rather than paying fixed rates for packages monthly, pay-TV service providers should introduce a subscription model which allows subscribers pay-per-view to enable them to match their TV consumption to subscription as it is with the case of electricity metering and mobile telephony, Moro said while moving the motion.\n\nIn event Multichoice chose to dare the Senate, its DStv package now cost: Premium (N21,000), Compact + (N14,250), Compact (N9,000), Confam (N5,300), Yanga (N2,950), Padi (N2,150), Business (N2,669), Xtraview + PVR access fee (N2,900). And the new prices for GOtv package will now be: Gotv Max for N4,150, GOtv Jolli for N2,800, GOtv Jinja for N1,900, GOtv Lite for N900.\n\nDisturbingly, there are no signals that the nations forex crisis may be abating anytime soon. According to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigerians spent a total of $39.66bn on foreign education and healthcare-related services between 2010 and 2020.\n\nThe CBNs Balance of Payments report revealed that Nigerian parents and guardians paid about $28.65bn for their wards to study abroad during the period under review. It also showed that Nigerians paid $11.01bn for healthcare-related services in foreign countries.\n\nThe amount spent on these foreign services is almost equivalent to the current value of the countrys foreign reserves which stood at $39.51bn as of March 23, highlighting its high cost.\n\nAccording to the report, the high cost of these services has drastically increased the demand for foreign exchange in the country, which has put a strain on the value of the naira to the dollar. The local currency closed at N417.00/$1 at the official market and N587.00/$1 at the black market on Wednesday.\n\nStemming the tide\n\nExperts say to stem the steady fall of the naira against the dollar, the federal government should as a matter of urgency put an end to the festering crude oil theft, boost oil production and put in place necessary measures to aid local production and exportation of other goods.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Cowry Asset Management, Mr Johnson Chukwu, said naira had continued to suffer a free fall because of weak foreign exchange earnings, due partly to the low crude oil production, crude oil theft and low export of goods.\n\nHe said, Its all about how much you spend on importation compared to how much you earn from exportation. We are not producing enough so we dont have enough resources to support the naira.\n\nThe immediate solution is to stop crude oil theft so we can make more revenue, and the long term solution would be to diversify our economy so that we can produce more exportable commodities or produce more of what we consume to limit our importation.\n\nAccording to Chukwu, the CBNs interventions, like the closure of Abokifx and ban on the sale of forex to Bureau De Change, could not bring down the price because the current price was a product of demand and supply.\n\nAlso, the President, National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, Ide Udeagbala, said critical infrastructure like power should be fixed to boost local production of goods, both for local consumption and export.\n\nHe said, The exchange rate could get to between N600 and N700 to a dollar with the way its going, as long as we are not exporting and we import almost everything.\n\nHowever, how do we talk about production when there is no electricity? The national grid collapsed twice two weeks ago and people had to buy diesel at N700.\n\nSo, the solution is that we must produce enough for export to earn forex. Crude oil theft is also an issue. If we are expected to produce two million barrels per day and today we are at 1.4 million bpd, is it difficult to know why we are here?\n\nIn his intervention, the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, said apart from addressing crude oil theft and boosting production, government should consider a flexible exchange rate policy regime, different from devaluation.\n\n\u201cThis model would enhance liquidity in the foreign exchange market, reduce uncertainty in the forex market and enhance investors confidence,\u201d Yusuf argued.\n\nAlso, it is a more transparent mechanism for forex allocation, it minimises discretion in the allocation of forex and reduces opportunities for round-tripping and other sharp practices.",

          "text": "Okey Onyenweaku\n\nDespite the headwinds, the Nigerian equities market at the NGX has remained bullish in the first quarter ended March 31, 2022, BH checks reveal.\n\nLooking at the details, the All share Index had gained 9.1 per cent (3,939.25 points), up from 43,026.23 points recorded on January 4, 2022 to now chalk 46, 965.48 points at the end of the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.\n\nMarket capitalization also grew 9.179 per cent or N2.123trillion from N23.183trillion at the beginning of the year to N25.311 trillion on March 31, 2022. This is no mean performance at this turbulent times when the world, Nigeria not an exception is facing one of the most troubling periods.\n\nThese challenges range from the effects of Covid-19, insecurity and a weak economy. Others telling challenges include the effects of the raging Russia/ Ukraine war which has further weakened the Naira, and high inflation at 15.7 per cent.\n\nWhile these have in fact affected equities, some stocks have however shown resilience in the midst of these troubles.\n\nThe top ten highest gainers in the first quarter included Cutix Plc which gained 35 per cent from 2.05 kobo on January 4, 2022 to 2.27 kobo a share.\n\nSimilarly, Total Energies markets appreciated 11.06 per cent from N238.50 per share on January 4, 2022 to N264.90 per share in March 31, 2022. Red star express inched up 11.1 per cent from 2.70kobo per share early in the year 2022 to close at 3.00kobo per share.\n\nConoil Plc advanced 11 per cent to N22.25 per share close at N24.70 per share at the end of first quarter 2022, while Berger Paints climbed 10.5 per cent to N6.15 per share to N6.80 per share. Livestock plc surged 10.5 per cent from 1.42 kobo per share to close at 1.57 per share, Cap Plc expanded 10 per cent from N18.00 per share to N19.80 per share; Regency Insurance extended its value by 9.67 per cent to its stock value from 0.31 kobo to 0.34 kobo; and Wema Bank \u2013 the only bank that made to the top ten gainers \u2013 rose 8.5 per cent from 2.70 kobo to 2.90 kobo.\n\nThese equities have proved to be formidable over the last three months and have moved against the odds given the harsh operating environment in Nigeria.\n\nAnalysts believe that only stocks with strong fundamentals can push against a strong whirlwind.\n\nBH recalls that the equities market gained 6 per cent at the close of business in December 31, 2021. This is a far cry from the superlative performance of the equities market with a growth of 53 per cent at the close of business in 2020, the notable year of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nBH also recalls that it has not been easy for the market to achieve the unprecedented growth that obtained in 2017 when the All share Index hit 74.73 per cent growth. At that period, the market maintained a bullish disposition and investors smiled to the banks.\n\nThe major indicators attained unprecedented heights.\n\nThe market capitalization peaked at about 13.1trillion and the All share Index gained a giddy height of 66,551.84 basis points on March 5, 2008. Most of the equities grew bullish and the Nigerian Capital Market was thrown into frenzy.\n\nThe market became the toast of the Nigerian Business community, with traders, civil servants, farmers and even students making equity investments.\n\nMany analysts note that the Nigerian Stock Exchange, now (NGX) had become a beehive of activities with both investors and speculators scrambling to make a kill. Some individual stocks recorded over 100% appreciation while others edged up by 50% and above.\n\nThe exchange has been demutualized and has moved from operating as a not-for-profit, member-owned entity and has become a profit-driven, limited liability company which is accountable to its shareholders.\n\nThe Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has joined the league of Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Nairobi Stock Exchange, which are already publicly listed companies. This has resulted in the creation of a new non-operating holding company, the Nigerian Exchange Group PLC (NGX Group) with Mr. Oscar Onyema serving as its Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO).\n\nUnder the demutualization plan of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, a new non-operating holding company, the Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), has been created. The Group has three operating subsidiaries, namely: Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX Limited), the operating exchange; NGX Regulation Limited (NGX REGCO), the independent regulation company; and NGX Real Estate Limited (NGX RELCO), the real estate company.\n\nYet this development has not changed the pessimism of those who believe the economic managers and the government are not on the right path.\n\nGoing to deeper grounds, recent statistics reveal that the rate of unemployment, the second highest in the world is 33%. At the same time, the underemployment rate stood at 22%; even as inflation, which had hit above 18 per cent last year is still quite high at 15.7 per cent. Nigeria has accumulated a total debt stock of N40trillion which is still growing.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the more dreadful aspect of it is that the federal government spends 90 per cent of its revenue to service the loans.\n\nInsecurity has not only hobbled agriculture, many parts of the Northern part of Nigeria have been taken over by bandits that not much business activities can subsist.\n\nWith the fearful scenario above, the economic trajectory of the country is still uncertain despite growing by 3.4 per cent in 2021.\n\nCoronation analysts said in the last trading session of the week, the domestic bourse reversed all the week\u2019s gains, bringing the All-Share Index down by 0.26% to close at 46,842.86 points, the lowest point since 31 January 2022. Sustained selloffs in Tier-1 banking names, GTCO (-4.02%), FBNH (-1.61%) and ACCESSCORP (-0.51%) continued to weigh on the market\u2019s overall performance. Having gained in two (2) of five (5) trading sessions this week, the ASI closed 0.26% lower w/w, extending losses for the third consecutive week.\n\nIt noted that Over the course of the week, Tier-1 banking names were hit the hardest as ZENITHBANK (-16.73% w/w), GTCO (-7.13% w/w), ACCESSCORP (-1.02% w/w) and STANBIC (-1.87% w/w) drove the week\u2019s loss. In addition, NB (-9.10% w/w) and midcap stock, INTBREW (-8.08% w/w) contributed to roil the overall market. Consequently, the year-to-date (YTD) return dipped to 9.66%, while the market capitalization shed \u20a657.70bn w/w to close at \u20a625.25trn.\n\nAnalysis of Friday April 1, 2022 noted that market activities showed trade turnover settled lower relative to the previous session, with the value of transactions declining by 21.77%. A total of 257.33m shares valued at \u20a62.86bn were exchanged in 4,586 deals. UBA (+0.00%) led the volume chart with 48.00m units traded, while ZENITHBANK (+0.00%) led the value chart in deals worth \u20a6541.33m.\n\nMarket breadth closed negative at a 3.08-to-1 ratio with declining issues outnumbering advancing ones. REDSTAREX (-10.00%) led thirty-six (36) others on the laggard\u2019s table, while NAHCO (+10.00%) topped eleven (11) others on the gainer\u2019s log.",

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nFrom a relatively unassuming street largely known for housing Kingsway Stores, Nigeria\u2019s most popular superstore in the 60s, 70s and 80s and the Federal Marriage Registry, Alfred Rewane Way (formerly Kingsway Road) in Ikoyi, Lagos, has become the nation\u2019s most opulent real estate capital, housing iconic office and commercial facilities.\n\nThe street is located in the heart of Ikoyi, the home of Nigeria\u2019s billionaires like Aliko Dangote, Mike Adenuga, Oba Otudeko, Tony Elumelu, Folorunsho Alakija, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Femi Otedola, and many others.\n\nNot contended with having Ikoyi as their residential abodes, these wealthy Nigerians now compete amongst themselves to build their corporate headquarters close to their lairs. And their choice? Alfred Rewane Way!\n\nApart from wealthy Nigerians, the popular street has also become attractive to a great number of well-off customers from all over the world, particularly software, social media and Information Communications Technology (ICT) companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook who are the current leaders of the global inflow.\n\nThe rush for presence on the highbrow street, BH learnt, is also being fuelled by the unrest in the Niger Delta, with several oil companies moving their offices and expatriate staff to Ikoyi.\n\nFuther checks revealed that in the space of 10 years, several upscale commercial properties, including office complexes, hotels and residential apartments had displaced exquisite shops and boutiques that hitherto lined the street.\n\nSome of the iconic properties now lining the street include King\u2019s Tower (built on the site of former Kingsway Towers), Famfa Oil Tower, BAT Rising Sun, Heritage Place, Alliance Place, Temple Tower, Dangote Towers, Lake Point Towers, Miliner Tower, BUA Towers, Southern Sun, Chelsea Group Hotel and Tarino Tower, amongst many others.\n\nHeritage Place\n\nLocated on the intersection between Alfred Rewane Way and Luggard Avenue in Ikoyi, Heritage Place is Nigeria\u2019s first green office building.\n\nA noticeable edifice to passers by, the ultra modern, eco-friendly building is owned by Actis, a leading investor in growth markets across Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nCompleted on February 15, 2016, the tower is a 14-story office building built on approximately 15,736sqm of office space and 350 parking lots. Other features include a double volume reception, raised floors, a cafe and coffee shop, suspended ceilings, a plaza as well as flexible floor plate sizes from 450sqm up to 2,000sqm.\n\nThe facility is a fortress owing to Its digitalised registration for all guests, including a face-capture system that helps the building to be fully aware of every occupants.\n\nOwing to its location and standout features, the facility currently has a tenancy rate of 93%, compared to tenancy rates of between 30 and 35 percent in other facilities in Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki.\n\nSome of its tenants include American computer technology corporation, Oracle, Actis, Andersen Tax, Verod Capital and Visa.\n\nOccupiers can rely fully on the managed services provided that focuses on health and safety, and security that have been factored in the development and conception of the office building, assured Funke Okubadejo, a director at Actis.\n\nBAT Rising Sun\n\nOwned by tobacco giant, British American Tobacco (BAT), the Rising Sun is situated on Alfred Rewane Way, spreading over 4,056 square metre.\n\nThe edifice, a mixed (office and residential) project, boasts of first-class technology that guarantees optimum comfort for staff and tenants.\n\nThe tower, an 11-storey edifice which occupies 6,000 square metres, accommodates staff offices, conference rooms and meeting rooms, while a section of it serves as residential apartments accessible from a different entry point. Made up of several 3-bedroom apartments and 4-bedroom penthouse, the apartments are tastefully finished.\n\nSecurity is also taken serious by the managers of the building, with close circuit cameras strategically mounted at every corner.\n\nAll entrances have swipe card door control system. A visitor is required to produce a card to enter every space in the building which he or she must swipe against the card reader on doors before they can give access. Also, card access is required to gain access to the elevators.\n\nThis is the West Africa office and Nigeria was selected because of the partnership we have enjoyed in this country over the years. A lot of attention was paid to constructing this building. It is a commitment from BATN that we are here to stay, said Mrs. Seyi Ashade, the Area Head, Corporate Affairs, West Africa region of BATN.\n\nKing\u2019s Towers\n\nAnother iconic building on the popular Alfred Rewane Way is the King\u2019s Tower (formerly Kingsway Tower).\n\nThe 15-storey mixed-use building developed by Sky View Towers was designed by South African architects, SAOTA. It is made up of 12 floors of office spaces spanning over 14,827 sqm, two floors of retail spaces covering approximately 1,545 sqm (total site area of 32, 800 sqm), a basement and a parking podium (3 above grade,1 below grade) for about 350 cars as well as a restaurant and cafe.\n\nThe facility has high net worth tenants, including IT giant, Microsoft, which recently opened a world-class office for its Africa Development Center (ADC) inside the facility. The new ADC offices which also houses The Microsoft Garage, accommodates the firm\u2019s product engineering, ecosystem development and innovation teams.\n\nFolorunsho Alakija\u2019s Famfa Tower\n\nAs its name suggests, Famfa Tower is being built by Famfa Oil owned by Africa\u2019s richest woman, Mrs Folorunsho Alakija.

He stated that the interventions were executed through the bank\u2019s development finance initiatives.\n\nHe listed some of the initiatives to include the RSSF, the Agri-business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme and the Non-oil Export Stimulation Facility among others.\n\nEarlier, the president, Enugu Chamber of Commerce Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ECCIMA), Mr Jasper Nduagwuike, applauded the CBN for its various intervention efforts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe various interventions in the various sectors of the economy have more than proved their commitment to seeing to the welfare and wellbeing of the Nigerian economy\u201d, Nduagwuike said, urging the CBN to redouble its efforts in bank supervision.",

          "text": "The opportunities, as well as challenges facing women innovators in Nigeria, came under the spotlight at the first of the Women in Innovation session of the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Innovation Media Series.\n\nWomen in Innovation, a virtual event held on Tuesday hosted by Innovate UK KTN\u2019s Global Alliance Africa project.\n\nEquality, Diversity and Inclusion programme lead, Innovate UK, Rachel Obrike, underscored the importance of amplifying women\u2019s voices and showing women innovators that are making a difference in the community.\n\n\u201cSo how do we spotlight? How do we amplify the voices of our women? We do this through PR and media coverage. We do this through telling stories,\u201d said Ms Obrike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much power in telling stories. We tell stories from generation to generation, which is really powerful. And it\u2019s also about creating content as we heard at the beginning and also building awareness.\u201d\n\nMs Obrike said Innovate UK, supported by Innovate UK KTN, has two targeted programmes \u2013 the Young Innovators Programme and the Women in Innovation Programme \u2013 to help engender equality diversity and inclusion as well as address under-representation in business innovation.\n\n\u201cOne thing about the Women in Innovation Programme and the Young Innovators Programme is around the role model aspects,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe know how important it is for you to see someone that\u2019s like you or where you want to be and then you work towards that. So we are using the Women Innovation Programme and the Young Innovators Programme to shatter various stereotypes and perceptions this is really important.\u201d\n\nThree panellists took part in a Zoom discussion themed \u2018Break the Bias: Focus on the Nigerian Media.\u2019\n\nA panellist, Oluwaseyi Ebenezer, the founder of Triple G Eco Revival Solutions, said as a woman innovator, her major challenge is people not believing in her. She told a story of how her company registered as a consultant to a Nigerian government agency and she was invited for an interview.\n\n\u201cWhen I entered the interview room, the panel were all men. They didn\u2019t want to ask me a question that ordinarily they would ask\n\nI had to tell them \u2018I know you are expecting a man but I\u2019m the founder of the company and I think I\u2019m the right person to ask questions or answer questions.\u2019\n\n\u201cOne of the problems as a woman innovator is people not believing in what we have to say or bring to the table. It\u2019s a cultural thing, it\u2019s a stereotype thing that we have to continually prove ourselves over and over. Most times it\u2019s very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAnother panellist, Odunola Olabintan, founder and team lead, The Health City, said people expect that women should take supporting roles when it comes to innovation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t associate innovation with women,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere is a passive questioning of your intelligence and your capacity to do the work that you are doing. They keep testing you at\n\nevery turn to make sure you are actually capable of the work that you actually started. A lot of people believe that women should take less intellectually challenging roles.\u201d\n\nA key challenge facing women innovators is a dearth of access to venture capital funds, compared to their male counterparts.\n\nIn the UK, for instance, a government-commissioned research found that less than one per cent of venture capital funds go to start-ups wholly run by women.\n\nAnother panellist, Obo Henshaw, Technical Advisor of Science and Innovation, UK FCDO West Africa, said people, and women as well, have to be ready for funding opportunities when they come.\n\nAfrica Regional Lead, Innovate UK KTN, Sophie West, said the organisation is working in partnership to strengthen the innovation ecoinfo systems within Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo within Nigeria at the moment, we have four different interventions, one focused on strengthening the investment pipeline,\n\none looking at open innovation using some of our innovation exchange models, one focused on, place-based innovation, for which we selected Ekiti state, to collectively strengthen the innovation ecosystem through the delivery of activities against an Innovation Action Plan, one looking at innovation, governance and knowledge exchange and how, perhaps, through the lights of commerce and partnerships, we can look at how the policy innovation policy and environment stand.\u201d",

          "text": "Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, has stated why he does not vote, claiming that it would be an injustice to the rest of his political children if he did.\n\nAdeboye, who urged his congregation to vote by registering with any party of their choice and ensuring that their votes were tallied, explained that he is not a politician, but rather a man whose mission is to pray for his country and his children.\n\nDuring his monthly livestream, which our correspondent was watching, he revealed this on Sunday, immediately before lecturing on the topic \u201cWaiting without Wasting.\u201d\n\nAdeboye said, \u201cMy assignment has nothing to do with partisan politics. I have never told you the candidate to vote or party to belong to because every party is heavily represented here. The only reason I have never voted is that if I vote for anyone, I will be unjust to the rest of my children and I\u2019m the father of all.\n\n\u201cYou are first a Nigerian before a member of a party; you have a duty to register, vote, and make sure your vote counts, you have a duty to belong to a party. You can\u2019t refuse to vote and begin to complain about the government.\u201d\n\nThe General Overseer continued saying, \u201cWait to make sure they count your vote, make sure there is no more rigging, I don\u2019t care who or party that you vote.\u201d\n\nAdeboye stressed that prayer plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the country got it right.\n\n\u201cThis year, I asked for 1000 people to join me in praying for the country but I got 26,000 we prayed and whether or not you believe it, God heard and has answered us,\u201d Adeboye said.\n\nAccording to him, I\u2019m still unsure whether there would be 2023 general elections. There are myriads of issues that are of interest to God concerning the country than to be fixed on an activity that is scheduled in about a year.\n\nHe said, \u201cTalking about myself as I\u2019m standing before you, I still don\u2019t know whether or not there will be election next year (2023). The last time there was an election, God spoke to me in June, I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the security challenges bedeviling Kaduna State and the financial issues of the country, warning that the generation unborn may bear the consequences if not tackled.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go to Kaduna by road or airplane (airport) because you may be attacked; why Kaduna. From reports, more than 80 percent of our crude oil is being stolen, who is stealing the oil, and where is the money going? What will they want to do with the money? What are the foreign nations buying the oil?\n\n\u201cMore than 90 per cent of our income is used to pay interest of the money we have borrowed, we are borrowing more, we are moving steadily to bankruptcy, and your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren will be paying debt,\u201d Adeboye said.\n\nHe revealed that he would continue to pray for politicians, noting that he has a single prayer point for them when they come for intercession.\n\nAdeboye added, \u201cI will pray and I have only one prayer point for everyone; father let your perfect will for this fellow be done.\u201d",

          "title": "NIN: Bar Outgoing Calls From Unlinked SIMs, FG Orders Telcos",
          "text": "Effective today, April 4, 2022, the Federal Government has instructed telecommunications carriers such as MTN, Globacom, Airtel, and 9mobile to block all outgoing calls from any Subscriber Identification Module cards that have not yet been linked to a National Identification Number.\n\nIsa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, announced the decision in a statement on Monday, saying it was part of the government\u2019s NIN-SIM linking policy execution.\n\nIkechukwu Adinde, Director of Public Affairs at the Nigerian Communications Commission, and Kayode Adegoke, Head of Corporate Communications at the National Identity Management Commission, jointly signed the statement.\n\nAs part of the regime\u2019s \u201csecurity and social policies,\u201d the Federal Government mandated that telecommunications subscribers link their SIMs with their NINs by December 2020. However, many Nigerians have questioned the effectiveness of the NIN-SIM linkage, as kidnappers of Abuja-Kaduna train passengers and others continue to call victims\u2019 families to demand ransom and go untraced with their NINs.\n\nPantami stated in a statement released on Monday that over 125 million SIM cards have had their NINs submitted for linkage, verification, and authentication to far, with the NIMC issuing over 78 million NINs.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018NIN-SIM Linkage: Federal Government Commends Compliance and Directs Telcos to Bar Outgoing Calls on Unlinked Lines from 4th April, 2022\u2019.\n\nIt partly read, \u201cAccordingly, Mr. President graciously approved the many requests to extend deadlines for the NIN-SIM linkage.\n\n\u201cAt this point, however, Government has determined that the NIN-SIM Policy implementation can proceed, as machinery has already been put in place to ensure compliance by citizens and legal residents. The implementation impacts on Government\u2019s strategic planning, particularly in the areas of security and socio-economic projections.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the implementation of the Policy with effect from the 4th of April, 2022. Consequently, the Federal Government has directed all Telcos to strictly enforce the Policy on all SIMs issued (existing and new) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOutgoing calls will subsequently be barred for telephone lines that have not complied with the NIN-SIM linkage Policy from the 4th of April, 2022.\n\n\u201cSubscribers of such lines are hereby advised to link their SIMs to their NINs before the Telcos can lift the restriction on their lines. Affected individuals are hereby advised to register for their NINs at designated centres and thereafter link the NINs to their SIMs through the channels provided by NIMC and the Telcos, including the NIMC mobile App.\u201d",

          "text": "Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the new Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and a former Governor of Nasarawa state, has told Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi it was wrong for them to have criticised the same APC government they are part of.\n\nThis is coming following the aftermath of a recent attack on a Kaduna-bound train by terrorists, Amaechi had said the tragedy would have been averted if the government had procured N3 billion his ministry had proposed.\n\nEl-Rufai had threatened that North-West governors could opt for the services of foreign mercenaries if attacks continued in the country\n\nAdamu spoke in an interview with the Hausa Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), monitored by Vanguard in Kaduna.\n\nHe said he would not take issues with the party chieftains but cautioned that \u201cone should not use a knife to rip open his stomach\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am a human being, I don\u2019t know what was in their minds when they made their assertions, but I advise you to go and meet them,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked why he never took offence if people called him a wizard, he said he was not eating humans and such name-calling only amused him but he never felt angry.\n\nThe National Chairman of the APC, however, said they would work assiduously and round the clock to ensure victory for the ruling party come 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis job is not a child\u2019s play or joke. It\u2019s a great burden that\u2019s bestowed on us. Our prayer to Allah, and from all our good friends and well-wishers, is to wish us success\u2026..First of all, we should find ways of uniting members of our party. We should be united, like a broom tied with one rope. Once that is done, our next move should be to confront the forthcoming election. We are the government, nothing will earn us praise unless we win the election.\n\n\u201cWe should win, win again, this is the task ahead of us. By the will of Allah, we will do what we can to be successful.\u201d\n\nOn how they will pacify those who were aggrieved by the outcome of the recently concluded convention of the APC, the APC Chairman said, \u201cFirst and foremost, it should be known that Allah gives leadership and not man.\n\n\u201cAllah will not come down and give leadership, there must be a cause, your fellow human will be. Whoever believes in this would not be worried if he vied to be Chairman, Secretary, etc., but couldn\u2019t be successful.\n\n\u201cBut a human being has his limitations. Some would think they\u2019ve invested their money, and their time in seeking these positions that were opened for the contest. But we have a responsibility to our party. It is our responsibility to meet these people, as much as we can to pacify them.\n\n\u201cWe know they are respectable, we know they are men of integrity and as the President had mentioned, anyone amongst them could be Chairman. But there is no way 7, 8 people could become Chairman at the same time. So, we should do all we can to have a good understanding of these people.\u201d\n\nOn the assertion that going along with him would not be smooth because people consider him to be rigid and hard to work with, the former governor said \u201cno one should be worried simply because someone told him I\u2019m difficult to relate with.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t even understand who is a person that it will be easy to relate with. I know of a person that is principled, with a clear mission that is on the path of Allah. No matter what; such a person will stick to the path of truth, will ensure only the right thing is being done and people would be happy about that.\n\n\u201cWe know, human beings have their weakness. I\u2019ve mine, but whoever knows me and he feels he has a way of confronting me, that\u2019s left to him.\n\n\u201cBut there is nothing to ponder about that I could be rigid. I have my opinion. But this is a party affair, not my property. It\u2019s for the people so there is no way I can be dictatorial. If you come up with something contrary, I will say no right away. But if you\u2019re able to explain and convince me, that will be okay.\n\n\u201cBut if you try to force things on us, without cogent reasons, something that will not be good for us\u2026.or because you have a personal relationship with me, you come with something different and you want me to accept because I\u2019m the leader, I will not agree with that.\u201d",

After gathering ourselves and our packs, we headed down to our homestay family\u2019s small dining room for breakfast.\n\nRefreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.\n\nWe were making our way to the Rila Mountains, where we were visiting the Rila Monastery where we enjoyed scrambled eggs, toast, mekitsi, local jam and peppermint tea.\n\nWe wandered the site with other tourists\n\nYet strangely the place did not seem crowded. I\u2019m not sure if it was the sheer size of the place, or whether the masses congregated in one area and didn\u2019t venture far from the main church, but I didn\u2019t feel overwhelmed by tourists in the monastery.\n\nHeaded over Lions Bridge and made our way to the Sofia Synagogue, then sheltered in the Central Market Hall until the recurrent (but short-lived) mid-afternoon rain passed.\n\nFeeling refreshed after an espresso, we walked a short distance to the small but welcoming Banya Bashi Mosque, then descended into the ancient Serdica complex.\n\nWe were exhausted after a long day of travel, so we headed back to the hotel and crashed.\n\nI had low expectations about Sofia as a city, but after the walking tour I absolutely loved the place. This was an easy city to navigate, and it was a beautiful city \u2013 despite its ugly, staunch and stolid communist-built surrounds.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government is hoping to add 800,000 barrels to Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production from some important upstream projects being executed by Shell, TotalEnergies, and other oil companies, which had stalled due to funding and other reasons. Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Gbenga Komolafe, disclosed this in Abuja at the 2022 Oloibiri Lecture Series and Energy Forum (OLEF) organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Nigeria.\n\nRepresented at the occasion by his Special Technical Adviser, Mr. Abel Nsa, Komolafe listed some of the projects government was relying on to boost production to include TotalEnergies\u2019 Preowei project, Shell\u2019s Bonga South-west Aparo, and Bonga North projects, as well as other projects being executed by other companies.\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome of these projects, including the Preowei project, the Bonga South West Aparo project, the Bonga North project, and a host of others, when completed, all have the combined capacity to add upwards of 800,000 BOPD to Nigeria\u2019s production figures.\u201d\n\nPreowei is a deep-water hydrocarbon pool located north of the Egina field in the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 130, off Nigeria. Discovered in 2003, Preowei has a subsea tank with over 150 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent and is expected to pump about 50,000 barrels of oil per day at peak.\n\nThe field development plan entails a subsea tie back to the Egina field Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility\n\nFinal Investment Decision (FID) on Preowei was fixed for fourth quarter of 2020, but was stalled following the suspension of the project same year by TotalEnergies due to COVID-19 constraints, concerns around new fiscal provisions in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector, as well as the collapse of oil prices at the time.\n\nShell\u2019s Bonga South West FPSO, with the capacity to pump 150,000 barrels per day, is another project government is relying on to boost daily oil production by 800,000 barrels. Bonga South-west was planned to add around one billion barrels to Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves.\n\nHowever, in February, the contract for the development of the FPSO unit for Bonga South-west was delayed, as the tendering process was put on hold till 2024.\n\nBonga, Nigeria\u2019s first deep-water oil field, currently has the capacity to produce 225,000 b/d of crude oil and 150 MMcf/d of gas, which feeds the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) plant at Bonny.\n\nShell had previously said it would develop the Bonga South-west project across three phases with a total potential yield of 3.2 billion barrels.\n\nDeveloping the Bonga South-west would cost $10 billion, according to estimates by NNPC, the concessionaire of the field.\n\nThe bulk of Bonga South-west\u2019s resources are located in OML 118, but it also extends into OMLs 132 and 140, operated by US major Chevron, where it is called Aparo. Other partners in the project are France\u2019s TotalEnergies and Italy\u2019s Eni.\n\nNigeria has been grossly underperforming in oil production, with Africa\u2019s largest oil producer failing to meet its production quota by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for many months running.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s 37 billion oil reserve, its production hovered abysmally low at 1.5 million per day, against the country\u2019s normal 2.2 million bpd capacity.\n\nThe poor production performance had been blamed on multiplicity of factors, including massive oil theft, non-starting of oil platforms, underinvestment, and divestment by the international oil companies (IOCs).\n\nKomolafe noted that with the commission now empowered by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the government could embark on the projects. To meet the increasing global energy demand, he said the federal government was set to embark on further exploration, adding that government also plans to embark on development drilling in its bid to optimise reservoir extraction.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is also ready to drill into new targets and employ technological advances to increase production outputs for appropriate energy mix,\u201d the NURPC boss stated.\n\nAgain, OPEC Fails to Meet Planned Oil Production Volume in March\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, failed to achieve their target crude oil production, despite the modest volume it was scheduled to release in March, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe oil producers\u2019 group only succeeded in adding 90,000 barrels per day of its planned additional 400,000 barrels per day, with only Saudi Arabia, and its neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, significantly increasing production during the month.\n\nMany other member nations, such as Nigeria, pumped well below quota mainly due to declining investment and operational disruptions, which had eroded their capacity for some time.\n\nOPEC had consistently rejected requests for an increase in production, even as the Russian invasion of Ukraine shook markets and boosted prices to $139 per barrel a few weeks ago. The group insisted that it will stick to the regime of careful increases in supply agreed last year.\n\nAlthough the cartel\u2019s operations data for each month, popularly called the Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), had yet to be released for April, covering activities for March, a secondary survey by Bloomberg revealed that the 13 members of OPEC produced an average of 28.6 million barrels per day during the month.\n\nThe figures are based on ship tracking data, information from officials and estimates from consultants, such as Rystad Energy AS and JBC Energy GmbH, which represent sources, other than those directly released by OPEC.\n\nAfter its meeting last week, the cartel raised Nigeria\u2019s production quota from April\u2019s 1.735 million barrels per day to 1.753 million barrels per day in May, even though the country has been struggling to meet lower production allocations.\n\nThe country has been constrained in meeting its OPEC quota for months, and as at the last production circle had as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to theft, ageing upstream infrastructure, and sabotage, as well as technical reasons.\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels per day output allowed by the oil producers, the country had managed to increase production to about 1.4 million bpd, the highest in recent times, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nFor Nigeria, while production challenges remain, the country\u2019s rig count was up by two in February, pushing it to eight from the initial six.\n\nAfter piling pressure on the cartel to increase supply for months without success, the United States and its allies have also decided to release at least 1 million barrels per day into the market to tame rising prices.\n\nThe Sanusi Barkindo-led group has, however, objected to the request to pump more oil, insisting that markets are not yet experiencing shortages and there is a balance between demand and supply at the moment.\n\nAccording to the group, whatever is happening in the market, like the Russia-Ukraine war, are extraneous to its activities.\n\nMeanwhile, oil posted its biggest weekly loss in more than 10 years after the Joe Biden administration ordered an unprecedented release of US strategic reserves to tame rampaging prices.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate dropped one per cent early Saturday and over $14 this week, the most since 2011 as the US plans to release 1 million barrels a day for six months.\n\nMembers of the International Energy Agency (IEA) also agreed to release another round of crude stockpiles, with volumes to be decided later, although the US expects them to release an additional 30 million to 50 million barrels.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision follows rocketing gasoline prices in America and concerns about supply shortages following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The war has roiled global commodity markets and driven up the price of everything from fuels to food.\n\nIt has also led to tumultuous trading in oil, with massive intraday swings throughout March. WTI for May delivery fell $1.01 to settle at $99.27 a barrel while Brent for June settlement fell 32 cents to settle at $104.39 a barrel.\n\nThe U.S. already tapped its reserves twice in the past six months, but that has done little to cool prices.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s giant oil release contrasts sharply with OPEC+, which on Thursday ratified a planned, modest production increase of about 430,000 barrels a day.\n\nContributing to the week\u2019s slide, also, were concerns about Chinese demand as the world\u2019s biggest oil importer implements a series of lockdowns to curb a resurgence of COVID-19.\n\nAdded to that, in spite of pressure from the European Union (EU) for Nigeria to ramp up its gas production, it has been unable to do so, as it neither has the funding nor the infrastructure. Russia produces up to 40 per cent of Europe\u2019s total gas consumption.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho",

          "title": "Nigeria: PDP Governors Delusional, Presidency Says",
          "text": "The Presidency, Sunday night, lambasted the 13 opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors over their position a fortnight ago that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was unfit to participate in the 2023 general election. APC said the governors were delusional and only sought to cover up their criminal failures and damaging PDP years.\n\nPDP governors had passed a damning verdict on the APC administration of President Muhammadu Buhari at a meeting on March 24, at the Umuobiakwa country home of their Vice Chairman and Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu. The meeting had 12 governors and a deputy governor in attendance.\n\nIn a nine-point communiqu\u00e9 at the forum read by Chairman of the PDP governor\u2019s forum and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, the opposition governors said should APC insist on contesting the forthcoming general election, despite its woeful failure in every aspect of national life, Nigerians should reject the ruling party outright at the polls.\n\nHowever, in a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), Mallam Garba Shehu, the presidency rejected the PDP communiqu\u00e9 and described it as a work of fiction by those who believed black was white, and one plus one equalled three.\n\nShehu threw the blame back at the opposition party, and highlighted the alleged damage done by PDP in its 16-year administration, as well as how the APC government had worked in the last seven years to refocus the country.\n\nThe statement said the PDP governors\u2019 declaration sought to cover up the failures of the party in office, which the Buhari administration and APC had attempted in the past seven years to repair.\n\nIt further carpeted the governors of the opposition party, who were signatories to the communiqu\u00e9, stressing that their antecedents make them unfit for the trust of Nigerians. The presidency alleged that the PDP governors were persons who had long profited from playing divisive politics, and fanning hate.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe rejected Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) fantasy communiqu\u00e9 is a work of fiction by those, who truly believe black is white and one plus one equals three.\n\n\u201cThis statement of the delusional seeks to cover up the serial and criminal failures of the PDP long and damaging period in office, which the Muhammadu Buhari administration and All Progressives Congress (APC) have strived these past seven years to repair.\n\n\u201cWe cannot forget under PDP, the nation had an army full of phantom soldiers, whose pay went to PDP politicians\u2019 pockets while our under-resourced real soldiers died in the fight against terrorist insurgents and our international allies refused to supply Nigeria kit and military aid.\n\n\u201cToday, with the APC, the army is resourced, we have fighter jets from our partners, Boko Haram is being driven from every inch of Nigerian territory, and ISWAP\u2019s leader eliminated in a Nigerian airstrike.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore how PDP politicians sought \u2013 and continue to seek \u2013 to inflame ethnic and religious tensions by refusing to even proffer a solution to the herder-farmer clashes, which became most prevalent under their misrule.\n\n\u201cToday, with APC in government, there are ranches on federal land and in state land, where there is the willingness to establish them. Clashes are reduced. Lives are saved, and livelihoods are enriched.\n\n\u201cWe will always remember how PDP politicians intentionally encouraged and exploited the black market in currency exchange to convert ill-gotten gains to foreign currency and undermine our national currency, then spirited their funds abroad in their billions and into foreign bank accounts.\n\n\u201cToday, with APC we support our national currency; we have achieved self-sufficiency in rice and fertilizer production; we refuse to allow greedy politicians and businessmen to hide their money overseas, and instead, build an economy here in Nigeria for all.\n\n\u201cWe will always know how PDP politicians raided the NNPC, consistently failed to pay into the Federation Account and, in the last year of PDP misrule, $20 billion dollars was simply found \u2018missing\u2019.\n\n\u201cToday, with APC, funds from NNPC are directly and transparently used to fund social and health programmes \u2013 such as COVID-19 response, the construction of roads, bridges and rail, and equipping of hospitals to cope with new and existing challenges.\n\n\u201cAnd then there are those PDP leaders in attendance, who signed the communiqu\u00e9. Who would trust such people with the running of our country? Who can believe a word these people say, as they looked outwardly stylish but harrowed by power-sharing and other troubles inwardly?\n\n\u201cThese people, who play politics of division and hate, create communal disturbances, need to change. The governors reeled out numbers on the economy, pretending as if the once-in-a-life COVID-19 pandemic, with its huge and devastating effect, disrupting global supply chains, uniformly battering the world economy never happened.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 brought suffering and hardship to the doorstep of the entire global community, less maybe, of the affluent and pretentious PDP governors and to the credit of this administration, Nigeria\u2019s economy recovered faster and stronger than the entire world ever imagined. Check the facts and leave the politics: What does the country get with this kind of gimmick?\u201d",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the expression of frustration over the security situation and threats by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State to invite foreign mercenaries in the fight against terrorists was a further confirmation and admission of the failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in which he is a key player.\n\nThe PDP maintained that El-Rufai could not distance himself from those fuelling and aiding insecurity in the country.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, PDP said the alarming insecurity in Nigeria that had led to the killing and maiming of tens of thousands of Nigerians since APC took office in 2015, was the result of the actions and comments by APC leaders and government officials, who encouraged acts of terrorism in the name of politics.\n\nPDP said Nigerians could still recall how in July 2021, El-Rufai, when asked why the federal government was lethargic in going after bandits, stated that the terrorists were collections of independent criminals for whom banditry was a business.\n\n\u201cNigerians can also recall how ahead of the 2019 general election, Governor El-Rufai threatened that, \u2018those that are calling for anyone to come and intervene in Nigeria, we are waiting for the persons that will come and intervene, they will go back in body bags.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe party said the media was also awash with reports of how governors of APC-controlled states, especially, in the North-west, publicly romanced and empowered terrorists by paying them billions of naira of public funds in various hurried, uncoordinated, and hazy negotiations.\n\nPDP stated, \u201cNigerians have not forgotten how in November 2020 the Muhammadu Buhari presidency, through its spokesperson, Shehu Garba, rationalised the beheading of 43 rice farmers in Borno State by terrorists and blamed the farmers for not obtaining clearance before going to their farms.\n\n\u201cSuch comments and actions by Governor El-Rufai, the Buhari presidency, and other APC leaders have the propensity to embolden terrorists to unleash violence on innocent people, the results of which are now apparent and living with us.\n\n\u201cOur party challenges Governor El-Rufai and other APC leaders to speak out on the confession by a former APC leader that the terrorists pillaging our nation were brought in by APC leaders to rig the 2019 general election, but had remained in the country following the failure by the APC to pay them for the heinous \u2018services\u2019 they were contracted to provide against the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nPDP said El-Rufai should know that he and other APC leaders could not under any circumstance distance themselves from blame in the worsening insecurity, pain, horror, social dislocation of families, and life-discounting experiences being encountered daily by Nigerians under the APC.\n\nPDP told El-Rufai that his suggestion or threats to import foreign mercenaries was counter-productive and capable of compounding the already dire security situation in the country.\n\nThe opposition party said it believed in the competence and capability of the country\u2019s gallant armed forces to defend Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, adding that the security agencies are only encumbered by manifest complicity, conspiracy, incompetence, and failure of the security command and control coordination structure of the APC administration.\n\nSeven of 11 Coaches Re-railed to Safety, as 80 Metres of Affected Rail Track Repaired\n\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) said it had re-railed seven out of the 11 coaches of the Abuja-Kaduna AK9 train, which was bombed last Monday by terrorists between Rijana and Rigasa, in Kaduna State. NRC also disclosed that 80 metres of the affected rail tracks had been repaired.\n\nIn a statement by its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Fidet Okhiria, NRC confirmed that four coaches (SP 00004, SP00009, SP00012 and SP00013) out of the 11 involved in the incident had been re-railed and safely moved to Rigasa Station, while work was on-going on the track repairs.\n\nOkhiria stated, \u201cWe did also state that 170 of the passengers onboard the train are safe while 21 passengers are reported missing. At the end of today\u2019s evening work, (02/04/2022), the NRC\u2019s restoration team has further re-railed four more coaches and two of the coaches (SP 00007 and SP 00013) had been safely moved to Idu and Rigasa stations, respectively. The other two coaches are still at the site due to damaged tracks.\n\n\u201cThis brings the total coaches so far re-railed to seven, but only five successfully moved to the stations. However, efforts are on to linked the track, at the moment, a total of 80 meters of the affected section has been fixed, including replacement of affected sleepers and twisted rails.\n\n\u201cThe corporation also confirmed updates that a total of 172 passengers on board the AK9 are safe and okay while 21 passengers are still reported missing. Let us assure our esteem passengers that the corporation, in collaboration with the security agencies, will leave no stone unturned in our efforts at rescuing the missing persons.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss condoled with those who lost their loved ones and prayed for the repose of the lost souls. He also sympathised with the injured passengers and everyone onboard for the trauma the unfortunate incident had caused.\n\nOkhiria expressed gratitude to the security agencies, particularly, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air force, Nigeria Police, and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, for their support and cooperation.\n\nEditor",

          "title": "Buhari is Overwhelmed, Nigeria in Serious Situation, Obasanjo Says",
          "text": "Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Sunday, said Nigeria\u2019s security crisis was reaching a tipping point, stressing that the situation is made even more serious as President Muhammadu Buhari seems overwhelmed by the country\u2019s problems. Obasanjo, who spoke in Abeokuta, was reacting to the recent bomb attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train, which killed eight persons, with many other passengers kidnapped or missing.\n\nThe former president agreed with the position of some members of the House of Representatives, who declared last week that nowhere was safe in the country.\n\nThat was as the foremost northern socio-political body, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF); the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cautioned against the proposal to use mercenaries in the fight against terrorists in the country.\n\nThe idea of resorting to mercenaries was mooted recently by the Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, after confessing he was \u201cangry, frustrated and felt totally helpless\u201d over the activities of terrorists.\n\nBut, in a welcome development, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), on Sunday, said it had successfully re-railed seven out of the 11 coaches that were affected on the Kaduna-bound AK9 train, when it was attacked by terrorists. NRC also said 80 metres of the affected rail tracks had been repaired.\n\nObasanjo said recent happenings had shown that Nigerians were no longer safe anywhere in the country, whether in vehicles, on the train or at the airport.\n\nSpeaking at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, inside his residence, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, while receiving a PDP presidential aspirant, Dr. Ugochukwu Williams, and his team, Obasanjo lamented that Nigerians \u201care no longer safe on the road, on the train and at the airport.\u201d He called for a concerted effort by stakeholders to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe former president said the present government was overwhelmed by the situation, cautioning, however, that Nigerians must not allow the problem to overcome the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, if anybody comes to say I want to see you, I want to talk to you, I will say \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019. This is because I believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again that the situation we are in this country is not a situation, where one man will say, yes, he has a solution, unless we are deceiving ourselves. I believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation.\n\n\u201cA situation where you are not safe on the road, you are not safe on the train, you are not safe at the airport, shows a very serious situation. I believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObasanjo wished Williams well in the pursuit of his presidential ambition.\n\nIn his remarks, Williams, flanked by House of Representatives aspirants from Plateau and Imo states, said he had, with regard to his presidential ambition, visited Obasanjo for consultation. The presidential hopeful described the former president as a leader, who was passionate about the peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\nWilliams said he was on a mission to \u201crescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nACF Cautions Against Use of Mercenaries in Anti-terrorist War\n\nMeanwhile, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) warned against the use of mercenaries in the fight against terrorists in the country.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, whose state had of recent been under deadly attacks by terrorists, was reported as saying he, alongside four other governors in the North-west, would hire foreign mercenaries to fight terrorists if the military failed to end the persistent attacks.\n\nEl-Rufai had said during an interview last Friday with journalists, after briefing Buhari on the attacks in his state, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, \u201cWhy is it that up till now the security has not gone to kill them (terrorists)? Where are our soldiers? Why have they not done it? That is why I have come to see Mr President.\n\n\u201cAnd also I have said that if these actions are not taken, it becomes a must for us as governors to take measures to protect our citizens, even if it means we will import mercenaries from outside the country to do it.\n\n\u201cIf our soldiers fail, I swear to God, we will do that. This issue has gotten to an alarming state.\u201d\n\nBut ACF, in a statement on Sunday in Kaduna, signed by its Secretary General, Murtala Aliyu, warned, \u201cInviting mercenaries to fight our cause must be treated with utmost caution.\u201d\n\nThe forum said it understood the frustration of the governors over the security situation, but noted that the country should avoid any haphazard approach to its problems. It maintained, \u201cThe security of the country rests on the central government and calls for cursory, calm, implementable and lasting solution.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, on the proposal to escort trains from Abuja to Kaduna, and Ibadan to Lagos or the Itakpe routes by the Nigerian Air Force, the forum urged security agencies to redesign their strategies and operations by deploying machinery and manpower to launch attacks on bandit and terrorist enclaves.\n\nACF stated, \u201cDedicating such operations to only railway lines shall make air and road users more vulnerable to such attacks. The new dimension of the terror attacks in the country, both on human and infrastructure, calls for total war.\n\n\u201cThe authorities may look at the possibility of utilising volunteers, such as the ex-servicemen and women, the civilian task forces, hunters and whatever is available to make every inch of Nigeria habitable and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe must appreciate the responsibility bestowed on us by providence as the largest black nation and as a leader on our continent, must do everything within our powers to keep Nigeria stable and strong.\u201d\n\nAfenifere: Inviting Mercenary is Ominous\n\nAlso, Afenifere flayed the suggestion by the Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, to invite foreign mercenaries to fight terrorism in the state, saying it represents an ominous sign for the country.\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, said the idea, coming from one of the closest allies of Buhari and a top member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), whose state faced grave security challenges, \u201ccalls for serious interrogation and action on the part of all those who should act.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said the fact that El-Rufai made the suggestion immediately after a meeting with the president could be an indication that what the governor heard from Buhari, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, was not reassuring enough.\n\nAccording to Afenifere, \u201cIf El-Rufai was convinced with the readiness of the federal government to confront the security situation, he would not have talked about seeking an alternative action, particularly, seeking the help of foreign mercenaries. This point is very important to be borne in mind as we interrogate the security problems confronting us today.\n\n\u201cFor, hiring the services of foreign mercenary is certainly beyond the power of any state governor, according to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And El-Rufai knows this so well. So, for him to assert that he (and a few of his colleagues) will resort to this option could be a pointer to certain things that had hitherto not been so clear to members of the public.\n\n\u201cAmong those could be the possibility that, perhaps, armed foreigners are already in our midst. It could also be a pointer to the fact that El-Rufai saw some kind of unwillingness on the part of the federal government to confront this problem headlong, hence his desire to seek help his own way \u2013 even when the manner of seeking such help is constitutionally beyond his power.\n\n\u201cBut then, his position could be understood against the background of desperation and the need to put an end to the horror going on by any means possible.\u201d\n\nAfenifere asserted that the solution to the problem did not lie in hiring foreign mercenaries but sincerely seeking available local the answers. The group said the first step was for the Buhari government to be genuinely determined to put an end to the carnage.\n\nIt stated, \u201cIn this determination should be adequate funding of the armed forces, proper motivation of the forces, a stoppage to the kid glove treatment being given to terrorists, and more importantly, immediate approval for willing state governments to set up their own police forces.\n\n\u201cThere are dangers in bringing in foreign mercenaries by these governors, because their antecedents in the recent past do not give us reasons to trust them. They could, perhaps, use the said mercenaries against indigenous people.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said such a call by a sitting governor exposed the governor as preferring to address an issue on the surface rather than from its root.\n\nIt stated, \u201cWho would pretend not to know that many of our farmers and local people live in hamlets and villages? Would it not be those innocent people, who would be so \u2018cleared\u2019 especially since fifth columnists are likely to have informed the terrorists of the planned invasion beforehand? This is one of the reasons why the governors cannot be trusted on the issue of importing foreign mercenaries.\u201d\n\nBased on the claims by official sources that more than N4.27 trillion had been spent on defence in seven years, Afenifere lamented that in spite of this colossal sum, \u201cthe situation is getting worse by the day.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja, James Sowole in Abeokuta and John Shiklam in Kaduna",
