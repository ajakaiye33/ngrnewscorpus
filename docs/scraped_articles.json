          "title": "NPO, stakeholders tackle Reps over press regulation bill",
          "text": "The Nigerian Press Organisation, which comprises the Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria, Nigerian Guild of Editors and the Nigerian Union of Journalists, has called on the House of Representatives to step down a bill seeking to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, saying it is still a subject of litigation at the Supreme Court.\n\nSeveral media organisations and groups also criticised various clauses in the bill as discouraging freedom of speech and press in the country.\n\nThe House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values, which organised the hearing on the bill, however, insisted on going ahead with the exercise.\n\nThe committee had organised the hearing on five bills, including the \u2018Bill for an Act to Amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, to Remove Bottlenecks Affecting Its Performance and Make the Council in Tune with Current Realities in Regulating the Press and for Related Matters (HB 330).\u2019\n\nAt the opening of the event, the Chairman of the committee, Olusegun Odebunmi, apologised to the media bodies, especially NPAN, which had protested on Wednesday over exclusion from the exercise.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, I am sorry if there is anybody who thinks we did not invite them. It is not by intention; it was definitely a mistake. Notwithstanding, we have covered everybody through our advert,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of Leadership Newspapers, Azubuike Ishiekwene, who represented the NPO, stated that contrary to the claim of an \u201copen invitation\u201d by the committee, the organisation did not receive any notification that would have enabled it to engage the lawmakers and Nigerians robustly on the bill.\n\nIshiekwene said, \u201cThere is a matter and I am sure that as stewards of the people and the law, you are aware that there is a pending matter between the NPO and some parties involved in this legislation. That is why a negotiated conversation seems to us to be a way to deal with it because there is a matter pending before the Supreme Court between the NPAN and some parties involved in this bill that is being amended. And as stewards of the law, I am sure you are constrained, just as I am to make any further conversations on this matter because it is a pending matter before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe last time it came up in 2010 \u2013 it is a matter that has actually been pending since 1999 \u2013 17 of the 39 clauses contained in the bill that you are considering were ruled unconstitutional by the court at that time. Of course, the Federal Government appealed the ruling. We won the appeal and the matter is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI will rest my case by appealing to the honourable members of this committee; I crave your indulgence to refer to a conversation that was had on a similar matter in 2018 when this matter came up before the Senate and the pendency of this matter before the court was canvassed. The Senate \u2013 the 8th National Assembly \u2013 at that time agreed that the prudent thing to do was to step it down. I urge this House to also consider a similar step.\u201d\n\nOdebunmi, however, said, \u201cIt is not about the matter in court, it is an Act of the National Assembly and we deemed it fit to amend it and we are doing that. It does not stop you from what you are doing, but this is the position of the National Assembly,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, the International Press Centre, Media Rights Agenda, Centre for Media Law and Advocacy and the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, in a joint memorandum titled, \u2018For a Truly Independent and Media Freedom Friendly Nigeria Press Council\u2019, called on the National Assembly to expunge all laws intended to criminalise free speech and press.\n\nThe memo was signed by the Executive Director, IPC, Lanre Arogundade; Executive Director, MRA, Edetaen Ojo; Executive Director, CMLA, Richard Akinnola; and Executive Director, PTCIJ, Dapo Olorunyomi.\n\nArogundade, who read from the memo, said, \u201cFirst, we like to say that the international behaviour towards media regulation is peer regulation, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, and the expunging from statute all laws that criminalises freedom of expression. This is the line the committee should tow like Ghana has done and like South Africa has done; and with regards to throwing off defamation statute from the books, the way Sierra Leone has done.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Press Council noted that the NPC Act had been a subject of controversy and litigation since 1999.\n\n\u201cEfforts to resolve perceived disagreements have been carried out by former ministers of information and former members of the National Assembly, but some issues continued to linger,\u201d the Executive Secretary, Francis Nwosu, said.\n\nNwosu, in his presentation, called for amendment of Section 3(1)(a) which empowered the council to \u2018regulate the print media and related media houses\u2019, asking that the \u2018related media houses\u2019 should be limited to online print media.\n\nNwosu added, \u201cThe inclusion of fake news is a welcome development. The proposed Act should define what will constitute fake news for easy interpretation.\n\n\u201cThe council suggests that a provision against hate speech should also be included in this amendment.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, ABUJA\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission INEC has disclosed that 14 political parties and 472 candidates will be participating on February 12, 2022, in Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory FCT, Abuja.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu announced this on Thursday in Abuja at the second quarterly meeting with political parties.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the FCT Area Council elections, political parties have concluded their primaries for the 68 constituencies made up of 6 Area Council Chairmen and 62 Councillors. A total of 14 out of 18 political parties have nominated 110 candidates for Chairmanship/Deputy Chairmanship positions and 362 candidates for Councillorships.\n\n\u201cAltogether, 14 political parties have nominated 472 candidates to vie for 68 elective positions in the FCT. An infographic distribution of the nominations by Area Councils is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d, he stated.\n\nAlso Read: Nigerians paid more for fuel, kerosene, cooking gas in May \u2014 NBS\n\nYakubu noted that in respect of the Anambra State Governorship election, all the 18 political parties have expressed interest to participate and have scheduled their primaries for the election in line with the dates provided for in the Timetable released by the Commission.\n\nThe INEC Chairman however frowned at the recurrent judicial incursion into political party affairs especially with respect to the nomination of candidates, saying political parties must hold themselves to the same high standards that they expect of INEC during elections.\n\nHe said; \u201cI would like to remind political parties about the recent letters written to you by the Commission on the imperative of complying with the provisions of the law as well as our regulations governing the conduct of party primaries and nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is not happy that candidates for elections are now being determined through litigations long after elections have been concluded and winners declared by INEC.\n\n\u201cThe problem lies squarely with the conduct of party primaries and nomination of candidates by some political parties.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to hold yourselves to the same high standard of free, fair, and credible elections that you hold INEC in all elections. You must ensure strict compliance with your party Constitutions, the law and the Commission\u2019s regulations and guidelines on party primaries in particular and the management of party affairs in general. After all, Nigerians only exercise their democratic right to elect leaders from the candidates presented by political parties. Electing good leaders begins with the quality of primaries conducted by political parties. We will do our part to ensure that our elections continue to improve\u201d.\n\nOn election expenses, Yakubu regretted that only a few political parties who participated in the Governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states have complied with extant laws.\n\n\u201cMay I also draw your attention to your obligation under Sections 92 (3) and 93(4) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) which require political parties to submit to the Commission their election expenses reports within six months and election contribution report within three months after the declarations of the result of an election. We have reminded political parties of these obligations in respect of the Edo and Ondo governorship elections held last year.\n\n\u201cHowever, only seven out of 14 political parties have responded in the case of Edo State and eight out of 17 for Ondo State. We wish to remind political parties of the consequences of the failure to do so as enshrined in the Electoral Act. We, therefore, expect all defaulting parties to comply in earnest as you prepare for forthcoming elections\u201d, he stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

And the Senate \u2013 the 8th National Assembly \u2013 at that time agreed that the prudent thing to do was to step it down. I urge this House to also consider a similar step.\u201d\n\nOdebunmi, however, argued that the House was doing its constitutional job.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am very sure (that) no court will restrain us from doing the job.\u201d\n\nHe noted that while the lawmakers would not stop anybody from going ahead with the judicial process, the lawmakers had the mandate of Nigerians to amend laws.\n\n\u201cIt is not about the matter in court, it is an Act of the National Assembly and we deemed it fit to amend it and we are doing that. It does not stop you from what you are doing but this is the position of the National Assembly,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso, the International Press Centre, Media Rights Agenda, Centre for Media Law and Advocacy and the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, in a joint memorandum, titled \u201dFor a Truly Independent and Media Freedom Friendly Nigeria Press Council\u201d, called on the National Assembly to expunge all laws intended to criminalise free speech and press.\n\nThe memo was signed by the Executive Director, IPC, Lanre Arogundade; Executive Director, MRA, Edetaen Ojo; Executive Director, CMLA, Richard Akinnola; and Executive Director, PTCIJ, Dapo Olorunyomi.\n\nArogundade, who read from the memo, said: \u201cFirst, we like to say that the international behaviour towards media regulation is peer regulation, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, and the expunging from statute all laws that criminalises freedom of expression. \u201dThis is the line the committee should tow like Ghana has done and like South Africa has done; and with regards to throwing off defamation statute from the books, the way Sierra Leone has done.\n\n\u201cA consideration is that the amendment seeks an unabashed focus to restrict freedom of expression while masking the toga of something else. It attempts to do what other laws have done like the Cybercrimes Acts which Sections 24 and 38, which in no fewer than ten instances have been used to clampdown on bloggers or journalists for expressing opinion antagonistic to politically or economically powerful elites.\n\n\u201cBodies like the Amnesty International has documented 50 cases where the law had targeted, not cybercrime suspects, but bloggers and journalists for writing on what they \u2018know to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another.\n\n\u201cThe ethical code that should be operationalised by the council is the Code of Ethics of Journalists in Nigeria as adopted by the Nigerian Press Organisation, comprising the Nigeria Union of Journalists, the Nigerian Guild of Editors and the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria in Ilorin in 1998 and as may be regularly updated.\n\n\u201dThis has been the practice. A political and non-journalism office like that of the Minister of Information should not be given the power of approval over the code of conduct of journalists.\n\n\u201cThe power to determine sanctions relating to hefty fines should be vested in the courts and not the council. The Court of Appeal has clearly established this legal principle in NOSDRA v Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (2018) LPELR-44210 (CA) where it held that \u2018the imposition of fines by NOSDRA was contrary to its powers on the basis that penalties or fines are imposed as punishment for an offence or violation of the law and the power as well as competence to establish that an offence has been committed belongs to the courts and not a regulatory agency.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe provision relating to revocation of license for alleged publication of fake news should be removed from the Act. Decisions for appropriate sanctions in relation to such offences should be vested in the law courts.\u201d",
          "summary": "Media organisations and groups yesterday asked the House of Representatives to drop all press regulations bills before it, arguing that clauses contained in them discourage freedom of speech and press in the country.\nThe House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values, which organised the hearing on the bill, however, insisted on going ahead with the exercise.\nI urge this House to also consider a similar step.\u201dOdebunmi, however, argued that the House was doing its constitutional job.\nAlso, the International Press Centre, Media Rights Agenda, Centre for Media Law and Advocacy and the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, in a joint memorandum, titled \u201dFor a Truly Independent and Media Freedom Friendly Nigeria Press Council\u201d, called on the National Assembly to expunge all laws intended to criminalise free speech and press.\n\u201cThe power to determine sanctions relating to hefty fines should be vested in the courts and not the council.",

So the argument that Urhobo or other ethnic groups contested during the turn of other senatorial districts will no longer be there\u201d.\n\nHe appealed to Chief Clark to help prevail on their Ijaw brothers to see reason with Delta Central Senatorial District on the need to strengthen the zoning arrangement on senatorial order for peace and stability.\n\nAlso, former Minister of Information, Prof. Sam Oyovbaire who spoke in the same vein, said the rotation of the governorship along senatorial line has brought peace in the polity of the state.\n\nOyovbaire said: \u201cThe moment we reduce the Nigeria or Delta state zoning arrangement to ethnic line, we will be in trouble. So we are pleading with our leader to prevail on our Ijaw brothers to reason in same line with us\u201d.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, asked for an amendment to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act to enable it regulate the use of the Internet by private broadcasting stations as well as other online broadcast media.\n\nMinister of Information and Orientation, Lai Mohammed, said the government has a duty to monitor all broadcast contents in the country.\n\nMohammed spoke at a public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values on a bill seeking to amend the NBC Act.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in the media industry kicked against the proposal which came barely a week after the NBC had asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nGovernment moved to license social media companies after Twitter took down a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, after stating that the message violated its policy.\n\nIn the tweet, the president had threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe bill sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values, Segun Odebumni and two others is seeking an amendment for the NBC Act.\n\nSection 2c of the proposed amendment listed the categories of licenses to be granted which include Cable Television Services, Direct Satellite broadcast, Direct to Home, IPTV, Radio, EPG and Digital Terrestrial television; radio and television stations owned, established or operated by the federal, state and local governments, broadcast signal distribution, Online broadcast, community broadcasting, public service broadcasting, among others.\n\nThe Information Minister said: \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have responsibility to monitor content, including Twitter.\u201d\n\nOn a proposal that the NBC should regulate and provide digital broadcasting in Nigeria in line with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) agreement 2006, he said the laws of the country cannot be subservient to any treaty\n\n\u201cWith due respect, our laws cannot be subservient to international telecommunication union treaties. It is true that we are part of the treaty, but our laws and act cannot be made subservient to any treaty. Treaties re made, but our laws will have to protect peculiar situations in our country. So, will suggest we take another look at this.\u201d\n\nBut the Institute for Media and Society (IMS), International Press Centre (IPC) and Centre for Media Law and Advocacy (CMLA) faulted the proposal.\n\nThey argued that inclusion of internet broadcast and online media to the category of broadcast service licenses to be issued by the NBC will be injurious to freedom of expression and press freedom.\n\nThe CSOs, in a memorandum submitted to the committee, also kicked against a proposal to empower the NBC to fix price for Pay-TV in the proposed amendment.\n\nExecutive Director of IPC, Mr. Lanre Arogundade said fixing tariffs arbitrarily could lead to excessive pricing, which could discourage investment in the sector.\n\nArogundade argued that the conduct of NBC over time presented it as an extension of the office of the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\n\u201cFixing tariffs arbitrarily could lead to excessive pricing that has the potential of discouraging investment in the sector and the attendant job losses. Giving the NBC the sole right over tariff issues which cannot be interfered with could be interpreted as an ouster clause that arrogates to it arbitrary powers that cannot be challenged even in the court of law.\u201d\n\nIn his intervention, Akin Akingbulu, executive director, IMS said the commission should not receive directives from the minister.\n\n\u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section six should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector,\u201d he said.\n\nIn their joint submission, IPC and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy said the appointment of the NBC board should be subject to the confirmation of the national assembly.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of the NBC has over time presented it as an extension of the minister of information and culture which rarely acts independently,\u201d they said.\n\nOnly recently, NBC had asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers to apply for broadcast licence.\n\nIts Director General, Armstrong Idachaba, gave the directive in a newspaper advertorial following Federal Government\u2019s announcement that Twitter and other social media platforms must register as a Nigerian company for them to do business in Nigeria.\n\nIdachaba said in the advertorial that the NBC establishment code empowers the commission to ask the companies to be licensed.",

The actor was limping and visibly shaking \u2013 an appearance which suggested a bad health condition.\n\nThe court clerk read out five count charges of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a Child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault-which contravenes sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015.\n\nThe actor pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\n\nWhile in the dock, Baba Ijesha showed signs of discomfort as he kept bending intermittently. The concerned magistrate, noticing the stress of the defendant, asked if he was fine.\n\n\u201cAre you okay? Do you want to sit down? Give him a chair to sit on,\u201d the magistrate said.\n\nThe actor was arrested in April over alleged defilement of a 14-year-old foster daughter of actress/comedienne, Princess.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nGunmen, again, struck at Obibi, Awo-Idemili in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State, and beheaded a private security guard of Imo lawmaker, Ekene Nnodimele, representing Orsu State constituency, before setting his house on fire.\n\nThe incident, which occurred at about 1am, yesterday, according to a source from the area, caused panic among the people of the community.\n\nThe guard was said to have been overpowered by a large number of hoodlums who invaded the lawmakers house. He was said to have attempted to run away from the hoodlums but could not, as they had him surrounded.\n\nThe lawmaker, who confirmed the incident, expressed shock and said he was still in disbelief on why he was attacked.\n\n\u201cMy security man was not just killed, but was beheaded. I call on security operatives to strengthen security in Orsu LGA and ensure that lives and property are protected,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a related development, the lawmaker also confirmed an attack on the country home of immediate past Attorney General of the state, Cyprian Akaolisa, in the same council area the same day.\n\nHe said the gunmen first attacked the erstwhile Commissioner for Justice before heading to his own home.\n\nHe confirmed that the houses were burnt, but no lives were lost except his guard who was beheaded.\n\nSimilarly, Daily Sun gathered that the gunmen also beheaded an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in the area, Jonathan Ugochukwu.\n\nVillage sources, also, revealed that the house and vehicle of the councillor representing Amaebu Ebenatu ward, Clifford Mazi, was not spared by the gunmen as they set it on fire, fortunately, he was said not to be around when the hoodlums stormed his home.\n\nAlso, the gunmen razed the house of the President General of Amaebu Ebenatu, Oliver Ejelonu, who was said to have narrowly escaped before they invaded his house.\n\nWife of the APC chieftain, Mrs Nkechi Ugochukwu, disclosed that the gunmen carried her husband outside and beheaded him before torching their house.\n\nMrs Ugochukwu said that the gunmen went away with her husband\u2019s head. A community source also revealed that the rampaging gunmen also left with the head of the lawmaker\u2019s guard.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe hoodlums did not meet the lawmaker and, in anger, they beheaded his gate man and left with his head.\n\n\u201cThey also invaded the house of another APC chieftain here, Jonathan Ugochukwu, burnt his house, beheaded him and left with his head. They also burnt the houses of the president general and the councillor representing our ward.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the former Attorney General, Akaolisa, said that he had reported the incident to the police. The state Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, said the police were already investigating the multiple incidents and noted that his men were closing in on the perpetrators.",

          "text": "Says banking sector remains liquid, well capitalised\n\nBy Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised the federal government to keep reliance on overdrafts from the Central Bank Bank of Nigeria ((CBN) within legal limits.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution said this should be done while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nSection 38(1) of the CBN Act allows the apex bank to grant overdrafts to the federal government to address any temporary deficiency of budget revenue, with sub-section 2 providing that any outstanding overdraft shall not exceed 5 per cent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the federal government.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s admonition was contained in a statement from preliminary findings of a virtual visit to Nigeria by its staff.\n\nAccording to the IMF, real gross domestic product (GDP) is recovering but unemployment and inflation remain elevated, noting that recent exchange rate measures were encouraging.\n\nIt, however, called for reforms to achieve a fully unified and market-clearing exchange rate, even as it expressed concern on the re-emergence of fuel subsidies, particularly in the context of low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe IMF team led by Ms. Jesmin Rahman, the statement added, held virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities between June 1 and 8, 2021 to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigerian economy has started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Following sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in Q4 2020 and growth reached 0.5 per cent (y/y) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the employment level continues to fall dramatically and together with other socio-economic indicators, is far below pre-pandemic levels. Inflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.9 per cent, owing to high food price inflation.\n\n\u201cWith the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued FX shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 per cent in 2021.\u201d\n\nThe IMF noted that inflation is expected to remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 per cent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\n\nTax revenue collections, it observed, are gradually recovering, adding that: \u201cWith fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for Covid-19 vaccines, and to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the Consolidated Government is expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent of GDP,\u201d it said.\n\nThe multilateral financial institution stated that downside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the COVID-19 pandemic both globally and in Nigeria.\n\nWhile commending the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of Covid-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination programmes under the COVAX initiative, it strongly expressed support to the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\nHowever, it expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies, reiterating the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor.\n\nThe IMF mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilise additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\n\nIt urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nIt also described as encouraging the recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate.\n\nThe IMF called for the sustenance of the momentum towards fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate.\n\nOn monetary policy to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, it recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using central bank or government bills of short maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the Nigerian banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalised, while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained.\n\nBut it advised that the extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalized except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability.\n\n\u201cThe IMF mission would like to thank the authorities and other counterparts for the open and thoughtful discussions and excellent cooperation,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I want to seize this opportunity to put it on record that our nation will forever be indebted to you, for your patriotic commitment to the defence of our fatherland against insurgency and criminality.\n\nI therefore commend you and remember all the personnel who have paid the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains an indivisible and secure entity. As I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, I want to assure you that this administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country, are well cared for. Furthermore, we will continue to ensure that our wounded comrades get the best medical attention towards their full recovery. While acknowledging your collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of our nation, I also wish to extol your steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties you experience in the Theatres of Operation. Your collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. We should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality. I am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East. The outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d By pooling together, the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve. Side by side with the efforts of the Armed Forces and security agencies, this Administration is developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building. Concerted efforts are being made to fast-track re-construction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East. I am hopeful that this will lead to the speedy resettlement of displaced persons, as well as the restoration of bubbling community life as the people return to their homes. Alongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d. Several interventions by this government have led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition. Many have been injected into the Theatre and soon other equipment that have just arrived the country would also be deployed to the Theatre of operations. Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long-term requirements. I would like, at this point to also commend the hierarchy of our Armed Forces for their strategic foresight in ensuring that some of our critical military equipment are fabricated locally. The repairs and maintenance of some of these vital weapons are now being carried out in the country thereby saving the nation a lot of foreign exchange and also creating jobs for our teeming population. As personnel of our Armed Forces and security agencies, you must understand that these items of equipment must be put to good use against the terrorists and other criminal elements. There is no room for complacency, and no need to be less than 100 per cent alert at all times. As your Commander-in-Chief, I want to assure you that this government will continue to work towards the provision of timely funding and procurement of equipment for the Armed Forces and other security agencies. This is intended to boost the prosecution of the ongoing war to a logical conclusion and also to serve our collective interests and well-being. In addition, your welfare is of utmost importance and concern to this government. I am glad that the gradual rotation of the troops in the field has commenced, as I directed. I am sure that this will minimize and possibly eliminate battle fatigue, as well as enhance troops\u2019 morale. I now wish to thank you for your unalloyed loyalty and selfless sacrifices towards the defence of our country. Your courage and gallantry will continue to inspire others, as they echo into the future. While I commend your resilience, let me remind you that there is still a lot of work to be done, to completely restore peace to the North East, stem the activities of armed bandits in the North West and North Central, as well as deal with other security challenges across the country. You must therefore remain steadfast and see this war to a conclusive end. In doing so, you must rely on interagency cooperation, strengthen your cohesion with the troops of neighboring Republics of Cameroon, Chad and Niger in our collective fight against the terrorists, under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force.

Very bad example for the next generation.\"\n\nOnly two days ago, Nigerian tweeps had taken to their social media handles to call out Nigerian football super star, Mikel Obi, stressing that Kogi State Governor, Bello's administration was not deserving of the accolade the footballer gave him.\n\nThey had called him out for pledging support for the political aspirations of the Kogi governor.\n\nObi had said he was hopeful that Bello and himself could work together as a team to achieve success.\n\nSowore, also via his Twitter handle on Monday, described Obi as a sycophant.\n\nSowore wrote, \"@mikel_john_obi As ur career in football flames out, another one starts in sycophancy + ass licking!

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) says Africa is currently experiencing a third wave of COVID-19 infections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, disclosed this at a media briefing on Thursday.\n\nThe development comes amid concerns over new variants of COVID-19, said to be responsible for increased infection rates.\n\nOn Tuesday, the ministry of health in Zambia had said the country\u2019s bed occupancy rate in COVID care centres had exceeded 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoeti, who noted that several countries in Africa have experienced a surge in infections, said it is time to step up efforts on vaccination.\n\n\u201cAfrica is in the midst of a full blown third wave. The sobering trajectory of surging cases should rouse everyone into urgent action. We\u2019ve seen in India and elsewhere just how quickly COVID-19 can rebound and overwhelm health systems. So public health measures must be scaled up fast to find, test, isolate and care for patients and to quickly trace their contacts,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe rise in cases and deaths is an urgent wake up call for those countries lagging behind to rapidly expand vaccination sites, to reach priority groups for vaccination and to respond to community concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA number of African countries have shown that they can move vaccines quickly, so while we welcome the recent international vaccine pledges, if we are to curb the third wave, Africa needs doses here and now.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement from the WHO, \u201cCOVID-19 cases in Africa are surging by over 20% week-on-week as the continent\u2019s third wave gains pace and nears the first wave peak of more than 120,000 weekly cases recorded in July 2020\u201d.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 cases rose to over 116,500 in the week ending on 13 June, up from the previous week\u2019s nearly 91 000 cases, following one month of progressively rising case numbers that pushed the continent over the 5 million case mark. In 22 African countries\u2014nearly 40% of Africa\u2019s 54 nations\u2014cases rose by over 20% in the week ending on 13 June. During the same week, deaths rose by nearly 15% to over 2200 in 36 countries,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cNew cases recorded weekly in Africa have now exceeded half of the second wave peak of more than 224,000 weekly cases in early January 2021. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia and Uganda have reported their highest number of new weekly cases since the pandemic began.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlong with other factors, a lack of adherence to transmission prevention measures has fuelled the new surge that coincides with colder seasonal weather in southern Africa and as more contagious variants spread. The Delta variant has been reported in 14 African countries and the Alpha and Beta variants have been found in over 25 African countries.\u201d",

          "title": "TeamApt anticipates unicorn bells on the back of $16bn agent banking blitz",
          "text": "TeamApt has become a leader in Nigeria\u2019s agent banking business and that could drive it to the envied status of a billion-dollar startup in the coming months.\n\nHeadquartered in Lagos Nigeria, the company started off in 2015 building applications for banks. By the end of 2018, it processed an average of $160 million transactions per month by supporting the operations of 26 banks.\n\nA year later, it launched Moniepoint, a platform for agent banking.\n\nAs one of the \u201cSuper Agents\u201d licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, TeamApt\u2019s Moniepoint powers thousands of shops where typical banking transactions \u2013 deposits, withdrawals, account opening and more \u2013 are now performed in Nigeria using point-of-sale devices.\n\nBut facing competition from other players, how well is Moniepoint performing?\n\nLeading the pack\n\nTosin Eniolorunda, TeamApt\u2019s founder and CEO, is confident that it is the industry\u2019s number one.\n\nHis audacity is based on data from SANEF, the body empowered by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria. According to this data, TeamApt accounts for 74% of the agent banking industry based on the volume of transactions processed monthly.\n\nSANEF\u2019s agent banking data is not public. It is sent confidentially to startups in the sector. TechCabal has not independently verified ranks of performance among these companies.\n\nEniolorunda points to the company\u2019s transaction value numbers as another measure of TeamApt\u2019s maturity in the fintech sector \u2013 and future valuation.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time, according to the CEO. The value for May was \u20a61.4 trillion ($3.5 bn) from a base of 68 million transactions. Total value of transactions TeamApt has processed between April 2020 and April 2021 is $16 bn.\n\nTeamApt says it processed $3.5bn in May 2021, thanks to its leading share of Nigeria\u2019s agent banking sector\n\nThese transactions are from four use cases: deposit, withdrawal, as well as airtime and bill payments. Moniepoint, the company says, has 14 million unique customers monthly.\n\nUnicorn calling?\n\nEniolorunda does not specify what the company\u2019s present valuation is. But based on the above numbers and those of other Nigerian fintechs, he believes TeamApt seats comfortably among the continent\u2019s most valued startups.\n\n\u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal earlier in May.\n\nIn March, Flutterwave said it had processed over 140m transactions worth over $9bn since its founding.\n\nAvailable numbers for Opay are from 2020; the Opera-backed company claimed to have processed $1.4 bn in October and $2bn in December of that year. Paga, on the other hand, processed $2.3 billion in 2020 and $8 billion over the last four years according to CEO Tayo Oviosu.\n\nBig Milestone for Paga @mypaga & Digital Acceleration\n\n\n\nWe crossed 3 Trillion Naira in transaction values processed since the start of commercial operations in 2012.\n\n\n\nHit N2 Trillion in March 2020\n\n\n\nHit N3 Trillion in May 2021\n\n\n\n15 months to process 1 Trillion!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 #JustPagait \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) June 7, 2021\n\nNot much is known about Firstmonie, also in the agent banking heavyweight category. Observers say it is more private due to its ownership by First Bank.\n\nUnless TeamApt is acquired for a billion dollars or goes public, the only available way to estimate its valuation will come after a funding round.\n\nRumors of an announcement circulated briefly in May but the company has yet to officially declare a round. Its last fundraise was $5.5m Series A in February 2019, led by Jim Ovia\u2019s Quantum Capital.\n\nAt a media event this week Thursday, Eniolorunda confirmed the round \u2013 \u201ca couple of tens of million\u201d \u2013 has been closed. Another \u2013 \u201ca lot more\u201d \u2013 is in progress.\n\nWhen these are announced, a clearer picture will emerge of the company\u2019s valuation, direction and, more broadly, investor appetite for high-growing fintech companies in Africa.\n\nFlutterwave and Chipper Cash have made headlines in the first half of the year with $100-million-plus rounds that catapulted them to unicorn status. OPay is reported to have a $400 million deal in the works which could value it at $1.5bn, and Paga expects to be a unicorn in a year or two.\n\nIs TeamApt next in line?\n\nDigital bank on the horizon\n\nMeanwhile, the company is evolving to a more consumer-facing company.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we are directing our business towards becoming a digital bank,\u201d Enioolorunda says.\n\nIn this new direction, Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking but will also be used as an app by individuals as a digital bank. Eniolorunda says this \u201chybrid approach\u201d is essential to truly serve underserved people in Africa who, for good reason, retain a need to physically visit service providers when quality falls short.\n\nThe other expansion on the company\u2019s playbook is geographical; TeamApt plans to start operating in the \u201cthird-largest francophone country\u201d in Africa by the third quarter of the year, the CEO says.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Banks and startups need to partner for growth but who can solve the risks involved?",
          "text": "Five Nigerian banks have signed up as pioneer members of a new initiative that aims to increase partnerships between corporations and startups in emerging markets.\n\nThe initiative is called the Circle of Corporate Investors and is organised by Catalyst Fund, an accelerator operating in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe aim is to help startups and corporates \u201cbetter discover technical and commercial synergies while sharing learnings and insights with the wider industry,\u201d says Maelis Carraro, Catalyst Fund\u2019s managing director.\n\nThe banks joining the partnership are Access, Sterling, Ecobank, and Fidelity. VFD Group, an investment company that owns VBank, a digital bank, has also signed up.\n\nThe startup-corporates face-off\n\nAdvances in digital technology have limited the barrier to service delivery in sectors like financial services. As mobile phones replace office buildings as access points, competition has increased between slow-moving old corporations and agile up-starts.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, the likes of Paystack and Flutterwave have taken command of online payments, enough to make respected institutions like Guaranty Trust Bank set up new structures to counter the threat.\n\nBut emerging market narratives of disruption that pit startups and corporates against each other gloss over many avenues of collaboration that currently lie fallow.\n\nFor all that is impressive about the current state of tech progress, the reality is that traditional corporates retain a stronger hold of offline markets and cover wider geographies than startups.\n\nOne example is Access bank. Founded in 1988, it has risen through managerial adjustments and corporate acquisitions to become Nigeria\u2019s largest bank.\n\nAccess has 36 million customers across 600 service locations in 12 countries on three continents. Somewhere in there is a trove of market resources that will be invaluable for startups that enter into strategic partnerships with the bank. Landing such a partner can signal a startup\u2019s ambition to competitors and legitimacy to customers.\n\nCorporates could benefit from startups\u2019 agility, innovation and flexibility to increase value to customers and speed up digital innovation, Carrro said.\n\nWhile their history and coverage are impressive, traditional banks were slow in pushing Nigeria past a 3% credit penetration mark until digital lenders came on board with avant-garde instant loans.\n\nBut partnerships are risky, yes?\n\n\u2018Leverage my market and network, while I leverage your tech and agility\u2019 should create a win-win for both sides. However, such business partnerships are not straightforward.\n\nA 2019 Harvard Business Review article explained that \u201cdisparities in size, structure and power\u201d can make it difficult for startups to connect with the right nodes within a large corporation. These disparities throw up risks for both parties.\n\nA startup may spend too much time building a custom solution for one large corporate partner, thereby failing to think of itself as a platform that can scale universally. Also, the corporate partner, distracted by other interests, may not devote the requisite high-level manpower to make the best of this partnership.\n\nThere are risks for corporates too. Startups are experiments and could come with reputational risks for corporates when they fail or splinter into some sort of scandal. As this World Economic Forum whitepaper notes, \u201cmany start-ups fail, so the investment risk for corporates is high compared to their usual investment projects.\u201d\n\nFrom the above, it becomes clear that for startup-corporate partnerships to succeed, some work needs to be done to mitigate the risks involved. It is possible that startups and corporates can, on their own, set up the right structures and interfaces to reduce such risks.\n\nBut what if a middleman does the work?\n\nDe-risking partnerships\n\nWith its Circle of Corporate Investors, Catalyst Fund hopes to be a partnerships accelerator by providing an ecosystem of tools that de-risk partnerships.\n\nIn its best form, such an accelerator should add precision to how corporates source, assess, and implement new innovations for their customers. Though its first members are banks, the initiative has plans to include telcos, FMCGs and logistics providers.\n\nThe perks of membership for corporates includes access to Catalyst Fund\u2019s portfolio of 40+ active startups in three regions. In Africa, that portfolio includes Chipper Cash, Cowrywise, Sokowatch and 27 other startups.\n\nCatalyst Fund is also promising \u2018custom toolkits\u2019 that will strengthen and streamline partnership processes. It plans to facilitate \u201cknowledge sharing roundtables\u201d with global corporate innovators.\n\nUntil now, Catalyst Fund\u2019s main focus has been to offer venture building support \u2013 product design, marketing strategy, and more to startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this experiment will fare. They point to helping Unilever reach millions of new consumers through Sokowatch as one instance of what they can help achieve.\n\nEither way, the Nigerian banks that have signed up think it will be a worthwhile adventure.\n\nNvalaye Kourouma, Chief Digital Officer at Ecobank, describes the initiative as \u201ca major step in building a framework for a productive engagement with startups and other key stakeholders to make this a success.\u201d\n\nFor VFD Group, it provides an opportunity to accelerate their vision of reaching the last mile with practical and empowering solutions, according to Gbenga Omolokun, the company\u2019s Executive Director for Group Risk, Compliance and Technology.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "Five Nigerian banks have signed up as pioneer members of a new initiative that aims to increase partnerships between corporations and startups in emerging markets.\nVFD Group, an investment company that owns VBank, a digital bank, has also signed up.\nBut emerging market narratives of disruption that pit startups and corporates against each other gloss over many avenues of collaboration that currently lie fallow.\nStartups are experiments and could come with reputational risks for corporates when they fail or splinter into some sort of scandal.\nIt is possible that startups and corporates can, on their own, set up the right structures and interfaces to reduce such risks.",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenya-based foodtech startup, has announced raising $1 million in pre-seed funding. This raise was led by pan-African early-stage VC, Launch Africa Ventures. Consonance Investments, Liechtenstein-based investment company, Century Oak Capital GmbH, and Pariti, an ecosystem management firm also invested in this round.\n\nFounded in December 2020 by France-born Robin Reecht, Kune\u2019s objective is to provide ready-to-eat food services at a moderate price.\n\nReecht revealed, per TechCrunch, that when he moved to Kenya in 2020, he found it difficult to get affordable and well-cooked food anywhere other than Uber Eats, Jumia, or Glovo with foods that go for $10. The alternative \u2014 cheap roadside food \u2014 didn\u2019t taste as good.\n\nHe took it upon himself to proffer a sustainable solution to bridge the gap between great food and affordable pricing. The following month, he started Kune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReecht tested for product/market fit by creating a trial in a week, from which he got 50 excited customers who had probably been waiting for such a solution. After the trial, his customer base grew to 150 people, and the startup sold over 500 meals.\n\nFood prices cost as little as $4, and Kune raised $50,000 from customers to sustain operations.\n\nBusiness was so good that the startup\u2019s small team struggled to meet their orders. Consequently, the quality of service dropped, and the company decided to retreat and take a break.\n\nIt turned out to be a time to rethink their strategy, as Kune resumed operations with more hires. The company began building a factory with the capacity to cook and package 5,000 meals daily. Kune was ready to raise, and investors took notice.\n\nTwo months later, with a million-dollar check in hand, Kune is one of the first non-fintech startups in the African tech ecosystem to raise a seven-figure pre-seed.\n\nThis funding will be used to internalise all production and human resources capacities, including hiring more team members, completing the factory building, and launching officially in August.\n\nLaunch Africa\u2019s Director of Operation, Baljinder Sharma, believes that having complete autonomy over their supply chain will provide massive growth and scaling opportunity for the startup; hence plans include owning a fleet of 100 electric motorcycles and hiring 100 female riders by 2022.\n\nReetch also revealed plans to create a food media company where Kenyans will be kept up-to-speed with the global food scene and export African foods to Europe and the US by creating weight-reduction, retail, and microwaveable meal offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe aim is to be the go-to for quality, freshly-made and affordable ready-to-eat meal delivery service and be a number one culinary major.

The executive producer, Peter Ramsey, is also the director of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse.\n\nIn an official statement, Ramsey pointed out that \u201cThe films in the anthology kind of run the gamut when it comes to science fiction. There are stories that touch on other worlds, time travel, and alien beings, but all of these genre conventions are seen through an African lens that makes them totally new.\u201d\n\nThe ten stories adapted for the series were selected after 15 projects were shortlisted and mentored from a stream of pitches received from several African creators.\n\nThe ten films include Stardust, Mkhuzi: The Masked Racer, Hatima, Enkai, Surf Sangoma, Moremi, Mukudzei (Adventures of Muku), First Totem Problems, Henderboy, and You Give Me Heart. These stories are based on themes ranging from fantasy, mythology, sci-fi, and politics.\n\nCreators behind the series include Ahmed Teilab (Egypt), Simangaliso \u2018Panda\u2019 Sibaya and Malcolm Wope (South Africa), Terence Maluleke and Isaac Mogajane (South Africa), Ng\u2019endo Mukii (Kenya), Shofela Coker (Nigeria), Nthato Mokgata and Terence Neale (South Africa), Pious Nyenyewa and Tafadzwa Hove (Zimbabwe), Tshepo Moche (South Africa), Raymond Malinga (Uganda) and Lesego Vorster (South Africa).\n\nApparently, the African animation industry has continued to be taken seriously, considering the growing interest from global animation studios like Disney.\n\nIt is also necessary to acknowledge other factors contributing to this: an increase in self-taught talents and indigenous animation studios daring to take on and execute projects \u2014 a notable mention is Nigeria\u2019s first feature-length animated movie, Lady Buckit and the Motley Mopsters (LBMM).",

          "text": "The Nigerian media industry has called on the House of Representatives to step down a bill seeking to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, saying it is still a subject of litigation at the Supreme Court.\n\nThis message was given by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO), which covers the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), and the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), at the House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values organised public hearing on the bill. The House, however, insisted on going ahead with the exercise.\n\nIn recent time, several media organisations and groups have criticised various clauses in the bill as possibly discouraging Freedom of Speech in the country.\n\nThe committee had organised the hearing on five bills that include the \u2018Bill for an Act to Amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, to Remove Bottlenecks Affecting Its Performance and Make the Council in Tune with Current Realities in Regulating the Press and for Related Matters (HB 330).\u2019\n\nOlusegun Odebunmi, chairman of the committee, apologised to the Nigerian media, especially NPAN that protested on Wednesday over exclusion from the exercise, saying an open invitation to the event was extended to all stakeholders.\n\nOdebunmi said, \u201cSo, I am sorry if there is anybody who thinks we did not invite them. It is not by intention; it was definitely a mistake. Notwithstanding, we have covered everybody through our advert.\u201d\n\nHowever, Azubuike Ishiekwene, editor-in-chief of Leadership Newspapers, who represented the NPO, said contrary to the claim of an open invitation by the committee, the organisation did not receive any notification that would have enabled it engage the lawmakers and Nigerians robustly on the bill.\n\n\u201cThere is a matter and I am sure that as stewards of the people and the law, you are aware that there is a pending matter between the NPO and some parties involved in this legislation. That is why a negotiated conversation seems to us to be a way to deal with it because there is a matter pending before the Supreme Court: between the NPAN and some parties involved in this bill that is being amended. And as stewards of the law, I am sure you are constrained just as I am to make any further conversations on this matter because it is a pending matter before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe last time it came up in 2010 \u2013 it is a matter that has actually been pending since 1999 \u2013 17 of the 39 clauses contained in the bill that you are considering were ruled unconstitutional by the court at that time. Of course, the Federal Government appealed the ruling. We won the appeal and the matter is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI will rest my case by appealing to the honourable members of this committee; I crave your indulgence to refer to a conversation that was had on a similar matter in 2018 when this matter came up before the Senate and the pendency of this matter before the court was canvassed. And the Senate \u2013 the 8th National Assembly \u2013 at that time agreed that the prudent thing to do was to step it down. I urge this House to also consider a similar step,\u201d Ishiekwene stated.\n\nOn his part, Odebunmi argued that the House was doing its constitutional job \u201cand I am very sure (that) no court will restrain us from doing the job,\u201d saying while the lawmakers would not stop anybody from going ahead with the judicial process, the lawmakers had the mandate of Nigerians to amend laws.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is not about the matter in court, it is an Act of the National Assembly and we deemed it fit to amend it and we are doing that. It does not stop you from what you are doing but this is the position of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn a memo was signed by Lanre Arogundade, executive director, IPC; Edetaen Ojo, executive director, MRA; Richard Akinnola, executive director, CMLA, and Dapo Olorunyomi, executive director, PTCIJ, the International Press Centre, Media Rights Agenda, Centre for Media Law and Advocacy and the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, a joint memorandum titled \u2018For a Truly Independent and Media Freedom Friendly Nigeria Press Council,\u2019 called on the National Assembly to expunge all laws intended to criminalise free speech and press.\n\nArogundade, who read from the memo, said, \u201cFirst, we like to say that the international behaviour towards media regulation is peer regulation, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, and the expunging from statute all laws that criminalises freedom of expression. This is the line the Committee should tow like Ghana has done and like South Africa has done; and with regards to throwing off defamation statute from the books, the way Sierra Leone has done.\n\n\u201cA consideration is that the amendment seeks an unabashed focus to restrict freedom of expression while masking the toga of something else. It attempts to do what other laws have done like the Cybercrimes Acts which Sections 24 and 38, which in no fewer than ten instances have been used to clampdown on bloggers or journalists for expressing opinion antagonistic to politically or economically powerful elites.\n\n\u201cBodies like the Amnesty International has documented 50 cases where the law had targeted, not cybercrime suspects, but bloggers and journalists for writing on what they \u2018know to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another.\u2019\u201d\n\nOthers are that, \u201cThe ethical code that should be operationalised by the council is the Code of Ethics of Journalists in Nigeria as adopted by the Nigerian Press Organisation, comprising the Nigeria Union of Journalists, the Nigerian Guild of Editors and the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria in Ilorin in 1998 and as may be regularly updated. This has been the practice. A political and non-journalism office like that of the Minister of Information should not be given the power of approval over the code of conduct of journalists.\n\n\u201cThe power to determine sanctions relating to hefty fines should be vested in the courts and not the council. The Court of Appeal has clearly established this legal principle in NOSDRA v Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (2018) LPELR-44210 (CA) where it held that \u2018the imposition of fines by NOSDRA was contrary to its powers on the basis that penalties or fines are imposed as punishment for an offence or violation of the law and the power as well as competence to establish that an offence has been committed belongs to the courts and not a regulatory agency.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe provision relating to revocation of license for alleged publication of fake news should be removed from the Act. Decisions for appropriate sanctions in relation to such offences should be vested in the law courts.\u201d",

          "title": "Airfares may crash in summer as Boeing Max 8 returns, COVID-19 fears hover",
          "text": "Nigerians travelling to various countries for summer holidays this year may be paying less for airfare as airlines deploy more aircraft to various destinations with the return of Boeing Max 8. This will increase capacity of airlines than it was during the grounding of the aircraft type in 2019.\n\nIn addition, airlines are not seeing as much traffic for summer as they used to because of COVID-19, making them introduce incentives to attract passengers to fly again, one of which is low airfares on frequently visited destinations.\n\nThe Boeing Max 8 aircraft was grounded worldwide on March 13, 2019, after two crashes, one in Indonesia in 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in 2019, killing 346 people.\n\nApart from the human tragedy, it was a huge blow to Boeing\u2019s business, since the company had thousands of 737 Max orders on its books. In addition to the flight control system at the centre of both investigations, other reports identified concerns with the airliner\u2019s flight control computer, wiring and engines.\n\nAirlines are now slowly adding the 737 Max back into their schedules. Southwest was the latest carrier to do so when it resumed flights March 11. The plane is now back in service with all US carriers and more carriers are expected to resume usage of the aircraft.\n\nAfter the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in November 2020 cleared the Boeing 737 Max to return to service, other regulators \u2013 notably those in Brazil, Canada, Europe and the UK \u2013 have done likewise.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa disrupts airline business with cheap airfares\n\nIn all, 13 carriers are now flying the 737 Max on commercial services. Cirium flight tracking data show that on March 5, operators carried out 280 revenue flights using the Max and that the in-service fleet had passed 100 aircraft.\n\nDestinations where carriers have resumed usage of these aircraft and are currently flying to are destinations where Nigerians frequently visit, some of which are US, Canada and Paris. Airfares in and to these destinations are expected to crash.\n\nSusan Akporiaye, national president, National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), states that globally, there are many aircraft on ground, especially with the return of Boeing Max 8, but a lot of passengers may not be willing to fly the aircraft, while others may be apprehensive of travelling as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAirlines are not having as much volume as they would have had. As a result, airlines are not increasing fares for summer. If there was no COVID-19, the impact of the return of Boeing Max 8 would have been appreciated but a lot of people are still afraid to fly because of COVID-19,\u201d Akporiaye says.\n\nShe acknowledges that ticket sales may be higher for July, which is summer as students are returning home, but traffic will still be low compared to the year 2019.\n\nShe says the thought of spending so much money on four to five COVID-19 tests for a return flight has continued to discourage passengers from travelling, noting that once the UK government relaxes the travel restrictions, there should be an increase in bookings to London.\n\nAlready, an economy class return ticket from London to Nigeria, which costs between N500,000 and N700,000 during summer now cost between N300,000 and N350,000.\n\nWorld airlines had earlier announced full-year global passenger traffic results for 2020 showing that demand fell by 65.9 percent compared with the full year of 2019, by far the sharpest traffic decline in aviation history.\n\nThe airlines, under the aegis of International Air Transport Association (IATA), show that the sector has shown little signs of recovery with December 2020 total traffic put at 69.7 percent below the same month in 2019 \u2013 little improved from the 70.4 percent contraction in November. Capacity was down 56.7 percent and load factor fell 24.6 percentage points to 57.5 percent.\n\nBookings for future travel made in January 2021 were down 70 percent compared to a year ago, putting further pressure on airline cash positions and potentially impacting the timing of the expected recovery.\n\nIkechi Uko, aviation analyst, says there are fewer passengers for summer with available aircraft, noting that some airlines are pulling some of their aircraft out from service since passengers are not available.\n\nUko notes that the number of annual tourists\u2019 visitation to Dubai reduced from 16 million in 2019 to 5 million in year 2020 as a result of COVID-19.\n\nDubai has stopped flights to certain destinations as a result of COVID-19, Uko states, adding that airlines that are operating may need to introduce incentives to lure passengers to travel again.\n\nTravel may soon gain momentum, especially in countries with high-vaccination rates. These countries include UAE, Seychelles, Malta, San Marino, Bermuda, Israel, Jersey, Guernsey Mongolia, Chile, Isle of Man, UK, Anguilla and Cura\u00e7ao, among others.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has restated that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is not living up to its responsibility of ensuring infrastructural development in the Niger Delta and raising the standard of living of the people.\n\nObaseki said this on Thursday when he received the Odiowere and elders of Ugha Quarters of Urhonigbe Town in Orhionmwon Local Government Area, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, represented by his Chief of Staff, Hon. Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain ongoing infrastructure projects across the state to boost economic activities and improve the lives of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are aware and know that the road has been awarded by NDDC. We make sure that we don\u2019t duplicate efforts. NDDC has not been forthcoming with contracts that have been awarded at that level.\n\n\u201cIn a normal system, if the NDDC has lived up to their responsibility and done the right thing, the government will not need to do the same project. We don\u2019t duplicate work; it amounts to a waste of funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNDDC left the road in a worse shape than it was before the construction started. It is not an excuse to allow the people suffer, following the failure of an agency to perform their statutory responsibility,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cAs soon as possible, we would send government agencies to check the immediate state of the road and report back.

Chinese President Xi Jinping once stressed the strategic importance of the ocean in China\u2019s pursuit of high-quality development, urging progress in the construction of world-class sea ports, a modern maritime industry system, and a green and sustainable marine ecological environment to push for the building of maritime power.\n\nThe Shandong Port Group Co., Ltd. established two years ago is now serving as a playmaker of the logistics industry. Regarding maritime transport, it has opened new sea routes, expanded shipping capacity, and reinforced transfer capability; in terms of land transport, it has launched train services, built land ports and exploited cargo resources. With 19 land ports and 72 combined sea-rail routes, the group has established a broad channel of international logistics, which has forcefully protected the smooth operation of the industrial and supply chains.\n\nThriving ports lead to prospering trade. Currently, the Shandong Port Group Co., Ltd. is accelerating the development of emerging businesses, such as shipping finance, to expand its pivotal role. It has also launched multiple cold-chain express routes to Southeast Asia and reinforced its handling capability of basic commodities.\n\nAt present, high-end cold-chain logistics, cross border trade, and bulk commodity distribution centers are under construction, while freight trains are running busily between the province and Europe, bringing products from thousands of miles away to more and more Chinese families.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nCities and industries are interdependent. Establishing interaction between port construction and urban development, Shandong Port Group Co., Ltd. is magnifying its influence with port-industry-city integration. It has joined hands with 16 cities in Shandong province to develop featured logistics park and chain-style industrial parks. By placing headquarters of ports in downtown areas, it is investing in port-centered projects to promote local economy. Besides, Shandong Port Group Co., Ltd. is also advancing overseas port projects such as the Port of Vado in Italy.\n\nBy tackling a series of technical problems and building a whole set of technical standards, a technical team from Qingdao Port under the management of Shandong Port Group Co., Ltd. has independently built a fully automated terminal, becoming a successful case of industrial internet application in port scenarios.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShandong Port Group Co., Ltd. is also working to apply new transport methods, building home ports of offshore wind farm, as well as demonstration ports of green energy and low-carbon development.",

Some of the legislators who claimed to lack the required financial deposits were also assisted to access loans by the CBN governor.\u201d\n\nOther sources listed infractions involving the CBN governor and his role in diverting the traditional agricultural insurance responsibility of the government insurance company to private companies in which his family members have an interest.\n\n\u201cThe 9th Assembly of National Assembly under Senator Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila can better be described as a compromised and silenced legislative arm of government under the current dispensation. No thanks to free access to contracts, cash, and patronage from strategic revenue-generating agencies under the legislative supervisory power of the legislators.\n\n\u201cThe legislators and their principal officers have graduated from constituency project implementation to allocation of slots in employment, where the current Minister of Humanitarian Affairs also settled them with N-Power and conditional Cash Transfer slots contrary to principles guiding the projects,\u201d another source stated.\n\n.",

          "text": "Laurent Gbagbo, the former President of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, has boarded an airplane to return home for the first time since being deposed in 2011.\n\nMr. Gbagbo was extradited to The Hague on charges of war crimes, although he was later acquitted.\n\nThere was a substantial police presence in Abidjan, the commercial hub of Ivory Coast, to prevent any violence, even as President Alassane Ouattara\u2019s government and Mr Gbagbo\u2019s supporters expressed hope that his return would aid in the country\u2019s reconciliation.\n\nHundreds of people took to the streets in Abidjan\u2019s Yopougon district, which is considered Mr Gbagbo\u2019s political stronghold. Hundreds took to the streets to demonstrate in support of his arrival. Police fired teargas in other neighbourhoods to disperse similar crowds.\n\nOne group chanted, \u201cGbagbo is coming. We will install him,\u201d while others shouted, \u201cRespect the power of Gbagbo,\u201d from mini-vans heading towards the airport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for me to go and welcome Gbagbo,\u201d said Liliane Kokora, who wore a t-shirt with Gbagbo\u2019s face printed on it. \u201cHe is finally arriving in his country to give us hope.\u201d\n\nMr Gbagbo, who came to office in 2000, was arrested after a brief civil war prompted by his refusal to concede defeat to Mr Ouattara in the 2010 election.\n\nMore than 3,000 people were killed in the conflict, which was fought largely along ethnic and regional lines.\n\nHe was acquitted in 2019 of war crimes and crimes against humanity charges by the International Criminal Court for his role in the violence.\n\nAt least 85 people died in the unrest surrounding the bitterly contested October 2020 presidential election, in which Mr Ouattara won a third term.\n\nMr Gbagbo\u2019s return comes after protracted negotiations between his camp and the government, which delayed granting him a passport until after the 2020 election had passed.\n\nAfter Mr Gbagbo announced the date of his return, the government initially complained that it had not been consulted but later said he would be welcomed back in the interest of national reconciliation.\n\nMr Gbagbo, 76, faces an outstanding 20-year prison sentence handed down in November 2019 on charges he misappropriated funds from the regional central bank.\n\nAt the airport in Brussels, a small group of Mr Gbango\u2019s supporters from Paris waited to see him off. Some wore T-shirts bearing his effigy, including one with text reading \u201cGbagbo the Unavoidable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would an individual seek to return to their country? Because it is his country. It is where he belongs,\u201d said Habiba Toure, one of Gbagbo\u2019s lawyers, before entering the terminal.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nSolomon Elusoji, Lagos\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, on Thursday said he is more at ease when visiting Maiduguri than Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nMaiduguri, the Borno state capital, is closer to Nigeria\u2019s insurgency war in the North-East.\n\nThe war has raged on for over a decade.\n\nBut Ndume, while speaking on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, said the insurgents have been kept away from the city and can only attack soft targets in other areas of Borno State.\n\n\u201cI live in Abuja and also live in Maiduguri,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I come to Maiduguri, I feel safer than in Abuja, because somebody can knock down your door with a gun. In Maiduguri, we don\u2019t hear of that.\n\n\u201cIt is outside Maiduguri where the insurgents are marauding around and attack intermittently. And that\u2019s normal with insurgents, that\u2019s why they are called insurgents, they do hit and run on soft targets.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that \u201cin every society, you can\u2019t wipe out criminality completely. In America, there is school shooting. Our own is that we have known terrorists and the army is fighting them.\u201d\n\nSenator Ndume, who has repeatedly called for more funding for the army, said the situation seems to be improving with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s commitment to the welfare of the fighting troops.\n\n\u201cWith the new budget, things will soon change,\u201d he said.\n\nA turning point\n\nSenator Ndume was speaking on the heels of President Buhari\u2019s visit to Borno earlier on Thursday.\n\nThe Senator described the visit as a boost to the morale of the Nigerian troops.\n\n\u201cThe President went round for six hours \u2013 I was tired. He came in 10 o\u2019clock and we were going to see various projects until four o\u2019clock this evening before he left,\u201d he said, praising President Buhari\u2019s stamina.\n\nSenator Ndume also commended President Buhari\u2019s bold welfare plans for the state, including the decision to build 10,000 houses for displaced persons and the provision of financing for a power plant.\n\nBut he urged the federal government to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d and fast-track its financing of army operations, especially the acquisition of improved fighting equipment.\n\n\u201cWe should now walk the talk by accelerating the release of funds on time,\u201d Senator Ndume said. \u201cThe army now has the numbers.\u201d\n\nA less hideous enemy\n\nWith the apparent death of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, terrorist group ISWAP appears to have replaced Boko Haram as the new face of insurgency in the region.\n\n\u201cISWAP is more deadly, more sophisticated, have international connection, access to military armament and the likes, but the other side of them is that they don\u2019t kill civilians indiscriminately like the Boko Haram and in fact that was what ignited the fight between the ISWAP and the Shekau group,\u201d Mr Ndume said.\n\n\u201cNow the Shekau group have been virtually eliminated, it means that our Nigerian troops are going to face what they know specifically.\n\n\u201cWhat was frustrating them most was the indiscriminate killing of civilians and other soft targets, destruction of public property by the Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cBut now that the ISWAP is saying we are just going after the military or the armed forces or the security agencies. Our security agencies are up to the task; Our security agencies are up to the task and ready for them. They have engaged themselves and (ISWAP) have suffered serious casualties.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has urged the military and other security agents not to give breathing space to terrorists and criminals in the country.\n\nThe President gave the charge on Thursday while addressing personnel of the Armed Forces and security agencies in Operation Hadin Kai at the Maimalari Cantonment during a visit to Borno State.\n\nHe said the war against insurgency must be concluded with the restoration of peace and reconstruction of all the affected areas.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging your collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of our nation, I also wish to extol your steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties you experience in the Theatres of Operation.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gunmen Kill Five Security Personnel In Zamfara\n\n\u201cYour collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari also said the nation owes a debt of gratitude to military men and women, and security agencies currently tackling security challenges in the country, particularly the many who paid the supreme price.\n\nHe assured that the government will continue to support all the loved ones.\n\n\u201d I want to seize this opportunity to put it on record that our nation will forever be indebted to you, for your patriotic commitment to the defence of our fatherland against insurgency and criminality.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, commend you and remember all the personnel who have paid the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains an indivisible and secure entity.\n\n\u201cAs I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, I want to assure you that my administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country are well cared for,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said wounded comrades will get the best medical attention towards their full recovery and commended the military and security agencies for the synergy that translated into successes in restoring peace and order.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy pooling together the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve,\u201d the President said.\n\nBuhari also assured that his administration is developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building.\n\n\u201cConcerted efforts are being made to fast-track reconstruction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that this will lead to the speedy resettlement of displaced persons, as well as the restoration of bubbling community life as people return to their homes.\n\n\u201cAlongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the carrot and stick,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said several interventions by the Federal Government had led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition.\n\n\u201cMany have been injected into the Theatre and soon other equipment that have just arrived in the country would also be deployed to the Theatre of operations. Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long-term requirements.\n\n\u201cI would like, at this point, to also commend the hierarchy of our Armed Forces for their strategic foresight in ensuring that some of our critical military equipment are fabricated locally.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the President\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in bringing the war to a conclusive end.\n\nThe Commander thanked the President for the visit to the troops, which he said will greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Babagana Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor, Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen Farouk Yahaya, Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo, Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao and National Security Adviser, Maj Gen.

President Kaunda was visibly pained in his response and at some point he broke down and wept. It was obvious to me how disappointed he was about some of the challenges that have plagued our continent for decades since independence.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Kaunda\u2019s death should remind Africans of the vision of a free, strong, united and prosperous continent the pioneer leaders had for the people.\n\n\u201cLet us, African leaders and people, never let the labour of these heroes\u2019 past be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nZambia Mourns\n\nKaunda died on Thursday following a struggle with pneumonia.
