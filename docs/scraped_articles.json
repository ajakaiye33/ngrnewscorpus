          "text": "Days after his death, a video has re-emerged on social media showing former Deputy Senate President, Ibrahim Mantu, confess how he rigged elections in Nigeria.\n\nMantu, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, was a member of the Senate who represented Plateau Central Constituency from 1999 to 2007. He emerged Deputy Senate President in 2003.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the member of PDP Board of Trustee died on August 16, 2021, at the age of 74.\n\nMantu had been actively involved in politics all his life before the annulled presidential election in 1993. He was the National Chairman, defunct Peoples Democratic Alliance; and National Publicity Secretary defunct United Nigeria Congress Party, amongst others.\n\nIn a video that has since gone viral, Mantu had said that he was a born-again politician after he graphically painted how he rigged elections for himself and his party.\n\nThe politicians had made the revelation in March 2018 during a Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Hard Core\u2019 programme.\n\nResponding to a question on whether he rigged elections in the past, the senator had said, \u201cYes, I did because I am now confessing the truth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to go and change results but when you provide money, you give money to INEC boys to help if they see any chance that they should favour you. You provide money to the security (agents).\n\n\u201cAll our elections in the past, I have been in this game for about 40 years and I tell you each time, it is not necessarily when I am contesting election but when my party sponsors a candidate, I will like the candidate to win an election.\n\n\u201cWhat we used to do before, we make provisions for INEC (Independent National Electoral Commission), we make provisions for security (agents), we make provisions for even agents of other parties so that they would not raise any objection to whatever we are able to get.\n\n\u201cSo, whether I rig myself or not, by providing those resources, financial inducement to the officials, I am rigging.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether there was any hope for a change in the political arena, Mantu had said it all depended on the players.\n\n\u201cIf people who are born-again like me refuse to do it. If we, the players, unless we give before somebody will take. So, don\u2019t give and you won\u2019t get takers.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even ask me why am I thinking this way? I am tired of being seen as a criminal in the streets of the world because I am a Nigerian. You assume that everybody is an innocent human being until his proven otherwise. But once you are outside this country with a green passport and they say you are a Nigerian, even if you are a Pastor or Imam, they assume that you are a criminal or you have criminal tendencies. That must change.\n\n\u201cI am tired of living in poverty in the midst of plenty. I am tired. No matter how much you have, you see people coming every day, relations, friends, (saying) \u2018my wife has given birth\u2019, \u2018my mother is in the hospital\u2019, this and that, every day.\n\n\u201cBut if everybody has enough to take care of his or herself they won\u2019t come bothering you saying give me this, give me that. And I believe that we have the resources, that people can live decent lives without being beggars to those in government.\n\n\u201cWe need good governance and good governance can be provided by good people who are truly repentant, who are there to serve the people, who are concerned about the primary wellbeing of the people.\u201d\n\nMany Nigerians including Leke Adeboye, son of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, have since shared the video of the Senator\u2019s confession after his demise.\n\nOne Othniel Gongden on Facebook said the Senator \u201cconfessed his sins before he died. May God forgive and grant him eternal rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis confession should not be swept under the carpet,\u201d another Facebook user, Bankole Olukunle noted.\n\nSince the return to democracy in 1999, elections in Nigeria have never been devoid of malpractices and violence. Rigging is one of the electoral offences provided for in sections 23, 24,117-132 of the Electoral Act 2010 as amended. Several penalties for the offences are provided in the Act as well. The United States had in the past hit election riggers in Nigeria with travel restrictions.\n\nINEC, the electoral umpire, had introduced a number of technological innovations including Smart Card Readers but underage and multiple voting, amongst others, have marred previous elections, resulting in legal tussles between contesting political parties and candidates.\n\nWith the 2023 general elections fast approaching, INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, had earlier in 2021, said, \u201cBy the principle established by the Commission, the 2023 General Election will hold on Saturday, 18th February 2023 which is exactly one year, nine months, two weeks and six days or 660 days from today.\u201d\n\nYakubu had also described as challenging, the prosecution of electoral offenders.\n\n\u201cFor instance, since the 2015 general election, 125 cases of electoral offences were filed in various courts out of which 60 convictions have been secured so far, including the most recent one in Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201cThe commission would like to see more successful prosecution of offenders, not just of ballot box snatchers and falsifiers of election results but most importantly their sponsors.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the day when highly placed sponsors of thuggery, including party chieftains and candidates that seek to benefit from violations of the law, are apprehended. We believe that the work of the proposed Commission will help in this regard,\u201d the INEC boss had said.\n\nWatch video:",

The group said \u201cmigrants from other countries smuggle arms through grazing routes without being checked\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigerian Army denies enlisting former terrorists into the Force\n\n\n\nThis is even as the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, yesterday, alleged that the attack on the heavily guarded Nigeria Defense Academy, NDA, Kaduna by the people it described as \u201crag-tag Fulani bandits\u201d with ease and without resistance, was a deliberate ploy by the present government in Nigeria to hand Nigeria over to Jihadists, adding that the attack at the NDA Kaduna was an indication that they may be planning to attack the Headquarters of the Department of State Services, DSS, where its leader Nnamdi Kanu is currently detained, intending to kill him and tell a fabricated story about his death.\n\nOhanaeze urges army to be humane\n\nObiozor who made the call Tuesday when the GOC of the 82 Division of Nigerian Army, Major General T.A Lagbaja paid him a courtesy visit at the National Secretariat of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Enugu, commended the GOC for the visit to exchange ideas.\n\n\n\nThe President General also appreciated the idea of having constant consultations with the GOC on the security situation in the southeast zone and emphasized the need to create an environment to reduce tension and feeling of insecurity in the zone.\n\n\n\nA statement by Ohanaeze spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia said that Obiozor used the opportunity to relay to the GOC, various complaints by commuters plying the roads in South East, over what they encounter on the various Army checkpoints in the region and urged the GOC to look into the complaints.\n\n\n\nIn his remarks, Gen. Lagbaja promised to look into the complaints, including the issue of demanding that commuters come out of their vehicles and raise their hands while crossing the checkpoints.\n\n\n\nThey resolved to be having constant consultations to ensure a cordial relationship between soldiers and the people.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr Osita Okechukwu has maintained that the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have a history of long cosy political understanding dating even back to 2013 when a faction of APGA joined the merger of APC.\n\nHe equally said that in 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cmore or less saved His Excellency Wille Obiano from his traducers, hence his re-election.\u201d\n\nOkechukwu, who is also one of the founding members of APC, said it was that background of cordial relationship that informed his recent counsel to APGA leaders to fuse into APC as a pragmatic step towards successful and seamless prosecution of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cSo, that suggestion was made from the prism of the pragmatic Zikist political model, which joins us with APGA. Pragmatism is the best strategy for Ndigbo to kill two birds with one stone, because if APGA fuses into APC that will gift APC with three states in the Southeast geopolitical zone \u2013 a milestone,\u201d he told journalists on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWith three strategic states of Southeast in APC\u2019s kitty, that is a halfway stroke to Ndigbo\u2019s ambition of achieving Nigeria president of Igbo extraction in 2023. Therefore, I implore to kindly consider the fruit in APGA joining APC to win the Anambra governorship. Other details will be cordially harmonized.\n\n\u201cMy take is that if the two parties-APGA and APC-come together under one bloc, it would then be possible for us to weigh the two flag bearers, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo and Senator Andy Uba, on the scale of which of them could better win the election in terms of acceptability, integrity, public service record, capacity and vision for good governance,\u201d the VON DG stated.\n\nOkechukwu, while faulting the claim by Chinedu Obidigwe that APC was plotting a forceful takeover of Anambra State insisted that the feasibility of his suggestion could be seen from the political understanding between the All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) in 1999.\n\nHe recalled: \u201cwe must recall that in 1999, based on strategic thinking, AD and APP were merged for the Presidential election.\n\n\u201cBut, although the powers that be wanted Chief Olusegun Obasanjo of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), every stakeholder in APP and AD, and indeed all progressive Nigerians saw the political understanding as a win- win offering on the ballot. So, with the benefit of hindsight, I am seeing the same opportunity for APGA and APC in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nObidigwe, the National Coordinator of APGA Media Warriors, had in a statement to journalists, criticised Okechukwu for asking APGA to integrate fully into APC and join the mainstream of Nigeria politics so as to help Igbo pick the Presidential seat in 2023.\n\nOkechukwu, responding, said APGA was missing the point by seeking to remain as a big fish in a small pond of regional politics that has only earned it just one state out of the entire federation.\n\nHe insisted that APGA can, apart from solving its intractable myriad of post-governorship primary litigations join its old ally, APC, to win the governorship, insisted of doing the same thing the same way and expecting a different result.\n\nThe VON DG pleaded with APGA leaders to give serious thoughts to his pragmatic suggestions, noting that indeed time has come for APGA to explore other avenues to achieve collective purpose for Ndigbo by teaming up with APC.\n\n\u201cThis tunnel vision of rigid partisanship has remained the bane of Southeast politics. Therefore, I am still calling on my friends in APGA to look up and count the stars. In 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari restored Governor Obiano\u2019s security details on the APC governorship campaign ground. In 2019, Obiano led APGA to reciprocate the grand political gesture of understanding by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, would it not make for a greater political impact and success, if APGA consummates what its leaders started right from 2014 by embracing APC in a closer embrace? They should show patriotism and respect for the campaign for Nigeria President of Igbo extraction by joining the mainstream, which APC\u2019s victory in the governorship poll will enhance,\u201d Okechukwu contended.",

According to NBS, the growth is an indication that the nation\u2019s economy has bounced back after the COVID -19 pandemic constrictions.\n\n\n\nThe NBS disclosed this in the latest report on the nation\u2019s GDP entitled Nigerian Gross Domestic Product Report (Q2 2021) released on Thursday.\n\nIt explained that the increase in the GDP index marked three consecutive quarters of growth following the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Q2 2021 growth rate was higher than the -6.10% growth rate recorded in Q2 2020 and the 0.51% recorded in Q1 2021 year-on-year, indicating the return of business and economic activity near levels seen prior to the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions,\u201d the report read.\n\n\u201cThe steady recovery observed since the end of 2020, with the gradual return of commercial activity, as well as local and international travel, accounted for the significant increase in growth performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 when nationwide restrictions took effect.\n\n\u201cYear to date, real GDP grew 2.70% in 2021 compared to -2.18% for the first half of 2020.\u201d\n\nBut the real GDP (quarter-on-quarter) grew at -0.79% in Q2 2021 compared to Q1 2021, indicating slightly slower economic activity than the preceding quarter due largely to seasonality.\n\nIn the quarter under review, the NBS revealed that the aggregate GDP stood at N39,123,713.32 million in nominal terms \u2013 higher than the second quarter of 2020 with aggregate GDP of N34,023,197.60 million, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 14.99%.\n\nIt added that the nominal GDP growth rate in Q2 2021 was higher than -2.80% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2020 when economic activities slowed sharply at the outset of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe Q2 2021 nominal growth rate was also higher than 12.25% growth recorded in Q1 2021,\u201d the agency said.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Igbo National Movement (INM) and Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) have rejected the proposed open grazing routes policy of the Federal Government.\n\nIn separate statements in Owerri, yesterday, they warned against its implementation in Igbo land.\n\nThe groups alleged that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was on a land grabbing scheme and the target was to appropriate lands belonging to other ethnic nationalities for the interest of Fulani herdsmen.\n\nINM National Director, Anthony Okolo, described the grazing routes policy as a deliberate action only the Federal Government to encourage armed Fulani herdsmen to further perpetrate their heinous activities in the South East.\n\n\u201cINM categorically asserts that no grazing routes exist in Igboland. We urge the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to steer clear of extending this desperation to seize lands for Fulani herdsmen away from Igboland. In Igboland, open grazing of whatever domestic livestock is abhorred and in most communities\u2019 sanctions are placed against owners of livestock found openly grazing or loitering in the community.\n\n\u201cBuhari\u2019s desperation encourages brazen conducts by Fulani herdsmen across Nigeria. INM is deeply worried by the fact that the continuing efforts by the Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to appropriate lands belonging to other indigenous ethnic nationalities in Nigeria for the benefit of Fulani herdsmen is directly encouraging the said Fulani herdsmen to act in audaciously brazen manners across Nigeria. Acting in manners to suggest they are above the laws and basically getting away with the commission of mass atrocities,\u201d Okolo said.\n\nPresident General of COSEYI, Goodluck Ibem, on his part condemned the policy saying Igbo youths were disappointed with the President for not concentrating on winning the fight against banditry and terrorism instead of creating more crisis in his grazing routes policy.\n\n\u201cWe condemn in strongest terms the approval for review of 368 grazing routes with dispatch by President Muhammadu Buhari despite condemnations by Nigerians. This is an intentional show of wicked ignorance by the President whose interest should be what will bring peace and security.\n\n\u201cThe President has not done anything to address the killings in Benue State and other states, nor has he addressed the assassination attempt on the life of the Governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom by his Fulani kinsmen. But he is rather interested on how to acquire land through the back door for his Fulani kinsmen,\u201d Ibem said.\n\nOpen grazing routes: Not in Yoruba land\n\n\u2022Region\u2019s self-determination group, OPSOM, dares FG\n\nFrom Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nOn Thursday, August 19, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari, approved 368 grazing routes in 25 states. The approval followed the recommendations of a committee set up to review \u201cwith dispatch\u201d 368 grazing sites in 25 states to determine the levels of encroachment.\n\nBut the approval kept on attracting criticisms from different parts of the country, especially states where open grazing has been banned based on criminality and insecurity associated with it. Some said cattle rearing ought to be a private business and the government should not use the country\u2019s commonwealth to promote one ethnic group to the detriment of others. Some even accused Buhari of trying to turn the country to a cow republic.\n\nOne such group, a pan-Yoruba self-determination group, Oodua People\u2019s Sovereign Movement (OPSOM), has vowed to resist establishment of grazing routes in Yoruba land.\n\nBut a statement from the presidency said the Federal Government took the step to curb the bloody clashes between herders and farmers across the country. The statement read in part: \u201cThe President\u2019s directive followed his approval of the recommendations of a committee chaired by the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.\n\n\u201cThe committee also recommended production of maps and geo-mapping/tagging of sites, analysis of findings and report preparations as well as design appropriate communication on grazing reserves and operations.\n\n\u201cThe number of the Grazing Reserves and States were deduced from considerations of existing security concerns and other pre-existing socio-economic conditions. The President directed that the assignment be undertaken with dispatch to bring more understanding on the grazing reserves and implementation.\u201d\n\nBut Oodua People\u2019s Sovereign Movement (OPSOM) made a commitment at the inaugural meeting of its governing council or the organisation, chaired by the Convener, Mr Maxwell Adeleye, to resist any attempt to establish grazing routes in any part of Oyo, Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti states. The group argued that grazing routes would not solve any problem as it would aggravate the existing ones.\n\nThe meeting ratified the objectives of the organisation, which is public interest advocacies with a view to supporting the self-determination rights of the Yoruba people.\n\nOPSOM, registered under the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), led by a renowned historian, Prof Banji Akintoye, expressed its displeasure in the way the \u201cFederal Government has consistently devised means to ensure the establishment cattle colonies in Yoruba land through a backdoor policy of tracing and reclaiming abandoned and archaic practice of grazing routes that was in existence in the 1960\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe council resolved to apply the instrumentalities of the law, media and intellectualism to fight what is considered illegality and a subtle attempt at land grabbing in favour of certain part of the country.\u201d\n\nDirector of Media and Communications, OPSOM, Mr Femi Oluwajuyitan, stated that the council also ratified the appointment of some people as interim management executive of the group, comprising Mrs Tosin Adeleye, as deputy coordinator; Oladapo Kayode, as Director of Legal and Compliance; Sola Adefehinti as Director of Finance and Administration; Mayokun Irekefe as Director of Research, Planning and Strategy; Kehinde Timilehin as Deputy Director of Administration and Finance and Desmond Adeyeye as Director of Contacts and Mobilisation.\n\nThe council agreed to give more room for consultations on the appointment of national coordinator as the deputy coordinator, Tosin Adeleye, was mandated to act as coordinator, pending the formal appointment of national coordinator.",

          "text": "\u2022Says invasion won\u2019t deter military\u2019s resolve to end criminality\n\n\u2022Commiserates with victims\u2019 families\n\n\u2022DHQ orders probe, denies staff slept on duty\n\n\u2022FG needs political will to deal with terrorists, says Okowa\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh, Michael Olugbode, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Ugo Aliogo in Lagos and Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said Tuesday\u2019s attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna, had provided grounds for more urgent measures to rid the country of \u201cvermin\u201d and emancipate the polity. Buhari stated this in a release by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina.\n\nThe president declared that rather than demoralise the country\u2019s Armed Forces, the attack would strengthen their determination to make a decisive end to criminality in Nigeria. He urged his critics to desist from politicising the terrible act.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters has ordered an intensive probe of the audacious invasion of the strategic military training institution. But it denied stories making the rounds that officers in charge of the Closed-circuit Television (CCTV) at the academy slept on duty while the criminals conducted the assault.\n\nBut Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, called on the federal government to muster the political will to deal decisively with bandits, criminals, and kidnappers, regardless of their ethnic group, religion, or status. Okowa spoke yesterday in Lagos while delivering a keynote address at the 2021 Ripples Nigeria Dialogue, with the theme, \u201cRebuilding Trust in a Divided Nigeria: Advancing the Conversation,\u201d organised by the Ripples Centre for Data and Investigative Journalism.\n\nThat was as more groups continued to condemn the development, which they said had grave implications for the country\u2019s fight against terror.\n\nBuhari, in the release, said the attack, which resulted in loss of lives and the kidnap of an officer, \u201ccame at a time that the military had put insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, and other types of criminals on the retreat.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe heinous action would accelerate the total uprooting of evil in the polity, which members of the Armed Forces are solidly resolved to accomplish in the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nWhile commiserating with the families, who lost loved ones in the attack, and praying God to comfort them, the president \u201cvowed that the deceased would not die in vain, as the degenerate act would have consequences that will eventually clean the country of vermin, and emancipate the polity from deliberate, targeted and contrived atrocious acts.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Nigerians, who valued and appreciated the efforts of the military to root out criminality from the whole country. But he urged those playing hateful politics with the base assault on the military academy to desist from such. The president said rather than resort to recriminations, \u201cthis is the time for all patriots and people of goodwill to support and encourage those who are in the vanguard of the battle against wickedness in the land.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Headquarters, which said search and rescue operation for the missing personnel was on-going, directed the management of the military institution to constitute a board of inquiry to look into the incident.\n\nA statement signed by the Director, Defence Information (DDI), Major General Benjamin Sawyerr, said the board, whose membership was ordered by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, was not disclosed, but it would ascertain the remote and immediate causes of the security breach.\n\nThe board, according to Sawyerr, was also expected to sanction personnel found culpable and make recommendations to prevent a future occurrence.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cLet me use this opportunity to reiterate that the NDA authorities, acting on the directive of the Chief of Defence Staff, has constituted a board of enquiry to ascertain the remote and immediate cause(s) of the breach of security with a view to sanction any personnel found culpable and also prevent future occurrence.\n\n\u201cLet me also assure that we shall continue to update the general public as events unfold as we are all aware the search and rescue of the abducted officer is still on. Troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria will continue with its operations to ensure all those involved in the dastardly act are brought to justice.\u201d\n\nDenying reports that personnel on duty at the CCTV monitoring room were asleep, when the bandits attacked the officers\u2019 residential quarters, the statement explained, \u201cThe Nigerian Armed Forces wishes to state categorically that the allegation is untrue and hence challenge the publication to publish forthwith a verifiable proof of personnel sleeping during the incident.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative to caution the publication to guard against being used as a propaganda tool by enemies of our dear country.\n\n\u201cIt should not consciously or unconsciously collaborate with these unscrupulous elements to spread unverified stories on the unfortunate event that occurred at NDA Kaduna while tarnishing the good image and reputation of personnel of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in the eyes of the civil populace.\u201d\n\nDefence Headquarters noted that the Nigerian Armed Forces was a professional force consisting of highly trained personnel, who were dedicated to their duties of protecting lives and property of all Nigerians.\n\nAs the attack on the elite military university continued to elicit shock and anger from Nigerians, the Delta State governor called on the federal government to summon the political will to deal decisively with armed criminality in the country, regardless of the ethnicity, religion or status of the culprits.\n\nHe lamented that the war on terror was being seriously undermined by the payment of ransom to criminal elements, saying there is need for the deployment of modern security architecture anchored on technology to win the war against insurgency.\n\nOkowa explained that the herdsmen/farmers conflict was fast becoming the greatest threat to the country\u2019s unity and economic wellbeing, adding that the nomadic Muslim Fulani pastoralists and Christian farmers of various ethnicities have continued to clash resulting in loss of lives as well as economic crops and cattle.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThis threat to our country\u2019s stability and unity needs to be addressed urgently by our federation. It is my opinion that ranching and cattle colonies with support by the federal government are a way out of this challenge.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must urgently tackle this challenge to reduce the level of insecurity and ensure food security. Criminal herdsmen must be dealt with within our laws and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) need to be resettled in their homes.\u201d\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives also decried the escalating acts of terrorism and banditry across the country, particularly, the invasion of the NDA. In a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the caucus lamented that hardly a day passed without the country being jolted by reports of gruesome killings, abductions, arson, and mindless plundering by terrorists and bandits, who now freely operated on highways, schools, and communities.\n\nThe lawmakers demanded immediate action by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government to check the ugly trend. They called for forensic investigation into the circumstances that enabled the invasion of the NDA and subsequent killing and abduction of officers.\n\nThe caucus also called for investigation into the concerns raised by some groups, including the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), about the handling of insurgents by the authorities.\n\nHowever, the lawmakers urged troops involved in the fight against terror not to be deterred but to remain firm in their commitment, promising to intensify legislative action that would support genuine effort towards restoring peace in the country.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe Minority Caucus notes the heightened attacks on military formations and mindless killings and maiming of innocent Nigerians by bandits and terrorists in various parts of the country, despite the assurances of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration.\n\n\u201cThe situation has become extremely horrifying in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Kano, Yobe, Benue, Borno, Niger and other states across our nation, where killers and kidnappers are now having a field day raiding communities and killing our compatriots.\n\n\u201cOn yesterday night, 35 Nigerians were reportedly massacred in Yelwan Zangam in Jos, Plateau State, barely a week after innocent travellers were ambushed and brutally murdered in the state.\n\n\u201cOur caucus is distressed that every day, families are deprived of their breadwinners, scores of children are orphaned, wives are turned to widows, husbands turned to widowers, parents are made to bury their children hacked down in their prime, with others languishing in their captors\u2019 dens and family source of livelihood destroyed.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Tony Ojukwu, condemned the attack on the NDA, describing it as an affront on Nigeria\u2019s security, which is highly unacceptable. Ojukwu, who expressed shock and disappointment in his reaction to the attack, said in Abuja that the NDA was a pride of the country, where people from other parts of the world came to train.\n\nThe NHRC executive secretary stated, \u201cThe invasion of the institution with high international repute, where very intelligent military officers are produced is most unfortunate, unexpected and condemnable.\u201d\n\nOjukwu said the attack on the military institution was bad in itself, and worst of all, officers were killed and abducted. He said, \u201cThis is the worst form of human rights violation of our time.\n\n\u201cMilitary officers, like other security personnel, are entitled to carry out their duties in relative safety and security. They are fathers and mothers of their families, who are entitled to go to work and come back alive.\u201d\n\nHe called on the military to leave no stone unturned in its efforts to rescue the abducted officer and fish out the abductors to face the wrath of the law, saying, \u201cThis will discourage further attacks on other national critical assets and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOjukwu commiserated with the families of the gallant men of the Nigerian military, Lieutenant Wulah and Flight Lieutenant Okoronkwo, saying they paid the supreme price in the service of their fatherland and their sacrifice would not go in vain.\n\nCondemning the attack, too, the youth wing of the highest Igbo sociocultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Wordwide, described the assault as an affront.\n\nNational Youth Leader of Ohanaeze Youth Wing, Damian Okafor, who stated this on Wednesday, while briefing journalists in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, noted that the group was solidly behind the position of the southern governors that open grazing be banned across southern Nigeria. Okafor said the attack was an affront on Nigeria\u2019s security architecture, stressing that open grazing has triggered conflicts between host communities and migrant herders, resulting in several deaths in states across the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIgbo youths condemn in its entirety the invasion of NDA, Afaka, where two army officers were shot dead and another abducted. Igbo Youths World Wide calls on the federal government to commence immediate investigation with a view to exposing the perpetrators of this heinous crime against the Nigeria Army and (they should) be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo youths stand by the unanimous decision of the 17 southern governors made known to the general public through a communiqu\u00e9 on May 11, 2021, resolving to ban open grazing of cattle in their states. We don\u2019t want to lose more innocent lives in Igbo Land. Enough of this carnage!\n\n\u201cWhoever that is subscribing for opening grazing in Igbo Land should know that our 17 southern governors are not stupid to have defended their people through that resolve. That person should know that he/she is the core enemy of Igbo Land and shall be treated as such.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) said the invasion of the NDA indicated apparent loss of control, explaining that it is a key indicator of a failed state under the present administration. The group, in a statement issued Wednesday by its spokesperson, Mr. Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said the attack signified a dangerous loss of control of the nation\u2019s territory by the government.\n\nIt said while effective governments provided core guarantees to citizens in the three inter-related realms of security, economics, and politics, the current administration in Nigeria had assumed the reputation of the most insensitive in the country\u2019s history, with the level of waste and impunity exhibited at the recent wedding of the president\u2019s son in Kano.\n\nThe northern group lamented that the polity had disintegrated to a point, where basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government no longer functioned properly.\n\nCNG stated, \u201cThis apparent loss of control by the government has given rise to widespread corruption allegations, and escalating criminality, rampant intervention of non-state actors with the attendant sharp economic decline, proliferation of refugee settlements and the involuntary movement of populations, which are key indicators of state failure.\n\n\u201cThe effect of the apparent erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions on such serious matters as national security, despite the more than N5 trillion said to have been invested and another N1 billion put in the purchase of arms, has invariably raised serious questions of credibility and probity against the administration.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says he\u2019s a political failure that has changed party five times\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nThe presidency has reacted to some recent utterances by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, where he accused President Muhammadu Buhari of making grazing routes a condition for peace. The presidency described the governor as an ethnic jingoist out to cause disunity among Nigerians. It also accused Ortom of being an ethnic irredentist, who had failed politically, having moved from one party to another for a record five times.\n\nIn a release issued Wednesday by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the presidency said it was unfortunate that a fair-weather governor, who played up ethnicity and sectarianism to achieve his goals, governed Benue State.\n\nAccording to the statement, Ortom stirred up hatred by targeting one single ethnic group in Nigeria \u2013 using language reminiscent of the Rwandan genocide.\n\nThe presidency said, \u201cAs was the case in Rwanda, where the then Hutu leaders of the country incited their countrymen against each other, claiming there was a \u2018secret Tutsi agenda\u2019 over the Hutu, Ortom claims there is a \u2018secret Fulanisation agenda\u2019 over other ethnic groups in his state and in Nigeria. This is a copy of the language of Hutu Power \u2013 which falsely, and intentionally, accused the Rwandan Tutsi of plans to dominate the country.\n\n\u201cThis wicked talk is aimed at giving cover to his so-called \u2018policy\u2019 on the Ranches Establishment Law, which in reality is purely an act of denial of the law, intended to withhold rights and freedoms from one ethnic group alone, whilst inciting race hatred against them amongst all others.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said, \u201cGovernor Samuel Ortom has few political principles. We can see this from the fact that he has changed political party five times during his undistinguished career. Every time he feels the wind may be blowing in a certain direction, he follows it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, for the good citizens of Benue State, the most dangerous direction he blows in today is that of sectarianism and ethnicity.\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to boost his sinking political fortunes, Ortom takes the cheapest and lowest route possible by playing on ethnic themes \u2013 and in doing so knowingly causes deaths of innocent Nigerians by inciting farmers against herders, and Christians against Muslims.\u201d\n\nIt also averred that Ortom was unbefitting to hold public office but took solace in the fact that 2023 was close-by for Benue people to vote right and restore the dignity of the state.\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThese are not the actions of a man, who should be trusted with running public services or holding public office. For the governor of a major state in Nigeria to be politically driven by ethnic hatred is a stain on our country.\n\n\u201cThe good, and fair-minded people of Benue State deserve more than this, and we look forward to the next elections, when they have an opportunity to restore its greatness.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

In a dangerous regression to Decree Number 4, the Buhari Government, using NBC, has ordered the closure of Channels TV and also ordered the arrest of the station's journalists for interviewing Governor Ortom who brought up the story of Buhari Fulanisation agenda, and a guest who revealed that people who are high up in the Buhari government are sponsors of Boko Haram,\u201d a top source revealed.\n\n\u201cThe government did not refute facts advanced by the guest, Commodore Kunle Olawunmi (retd.), that the government has the names of sponsors linked to the conviction of Boko Haram sponsors in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cRather than provide a concrete refutation, the government is trying to gag the media by attacking the constitutional rights of the media and the journalist to practice their profession unfettered,\u201d the source added.\n\nAnother source familiar with the order stated that the Buhari government had issued a directive to the NBC to sanction Channels TV for airing the two \u201cunpleasant\u201d interviews.\n\n\u201cChannels TV license is to be suspended by the Federal Government over the interview of Governor Ortom and retired naval personnel. There is also an order for the arrest of journalist Chamberlain and his colleagues, who are anchors of the program.\n\n\u201cThey are to be brought to Abuja tomorrow,\u201d the source stated.\n\nThis is not the first time the NBC would suspend media organizations under the repressive Buhari regime.\n\nIn 2019, the commission suspended Daar Communication\u2019s AIT in the heat of the run-off to the 2019 general elections for being too critical of the Federal Government.\n\nAlso in April 2021, NBC suspended Channels Television for airing an Indigenous People Of Biafra interview.\n\nNBC had said the IPOB spokesperson made derogatory and misleading statements about the Nigerian Army.\n\nAccording to the commission, airing the interview breached the broadcast code. The NBC slammed a fine on the broadcasting company to the tune of N5million.",

We say no to her false promises.\n\n\u201cWhy would the federal government used and dumped us? How would it dump 500,000 law-abiding youths? We worked for it and we deserved to be given an exit package if at all the federal government can't employ us after they promised and later abandoned us.\n\n\u201cAfterall, we and our family members contributed much for the election that brought them, APC into power,\u201d he said.\n\nConfirming the situation to SaharaReporters on Wednesday, the National President of Exited NPower, Comrade Bashir Gobir said, \u201cThe Federal Government through Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development has refused to fulfil this promise since June and July 2020 to date.\n\n\u201cI have received more than a hundred calls every day from the disengaged beneficiaries; the same thing on my WhatsApp. This is uncomfortable. Sadiya Faruq promised us loans but nothing has been heard about the issue. It\u2019s over a year. It\u2019s so sad this is coming from her office and the Nigerian government.\u201d",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter. It later pivoted to a model similar to MaxAB\u2019s own, pulling out of Ivory Coast and Togo to focus on growing its network of over 8,000 retailers in Morocco.\n\nThe acquisition will see MaxAB accelerate its expansion into the Maghreb market \u2013 Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 empowered by WaystoCap\u2019s expertise in the region.\n\nWaystoCap is the second African YC-backed company to exit over the past year after Paystack got acquired by Stripe for more than $200 million last October.\n\n\u201cWe are about to take the food and grocery industry to another level in North Africa,\u201d Co-Founder and CEO at MaxAB, Belal El-Megharbel, said on the company\u2019s expansion and the synergies with WaystoCap.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this new super-team, combining a powerhouse of talent, technological know-how, on the ground infrastructure, boosted supply chains and WaystoCap\u2019s phenomenal experience of the region is very exciting.\u201d\n\nMaxAB\u2019s acquisition will now see more than 70,000 retailers supplied with essential food and groceries across multiple markets.\n\nNiama El Bassunie, CEO & Founder of WaystoCap who will take on the position of the managing director at MaxAB Morocco added: \u201cWe are thrilled to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team being created and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply. We are looking forward to continuing our close working relationship with our new team and taking the business to its next phase.\u201d\n\nFor MaxAB, the Maghreb market is a new territory and this new strategic acquisition will position the expanded team to be North Africa\u2019s leading business-to-business eCommerce platform for retailers and suppliers.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Ethiopia has begun developing its own social media platforms to rival Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Zoom, as per Reuters.\n\nAccording to the state communications security agency on Monday, the government wants its local platform to \u201creplace\u201d existing platforms, although it does not plan to block the other services.\n\nThe director-general of the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), Shumete Gizaw has accused Facebook of deleting posts and user accounts that he said were \u201cdisseminating the true reality about Ethiopia.\u201d\n\nIn June, Facebook pulled down fake accounts targeting opposition figures ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives election, a move that didn\u2019t sit well with the incumbent Ethiopian government. In a local media outlet on Friday, Shumete accused Facebook of blocking users who were \u201cpreaching national unity and peace\u201d.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethiopian government has been criticized for shutting down access to internet and social media services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, due to unrest in the Tigray region and during the election. The government has not commented on those shutdowns.\n\nSince November 2020, Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous country with about 115 million people, has been engulfed in a civil war between the federal government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the Tigray region in the country\u2019s north.\n\nSupporters of the different sides have taken the conversation over to social media.\n\nTo build these platforms, Ethiopia is relying solely on local expertise. While Shumete declined to share further details about its social media rival project, he proudly asserted that Ethiopia won\u2019t be the first to rely on local talents to build its social networks.\n\n\u201cThe rationale behind developing technology with local capacity is clear \u2026 Why do you think China is using WeChat?\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing such a parallel with the social messaging app WeChat is a bit troubling. WeChat, which is owned by China-headquartered Tencent Holdings, is widely used in the country and is considered to be a strong tool by Chinese authorities for monitoring its population.\n\nAffected by the pandemic, the Ethiopian government has a lot on its plate as it works towards economic recovery. It\u2019s looking to raise money via sales of telecom licenses and obtaining an additional $1 billion debt.\n\nThis begs the question of whether investing in state-owned social network platforms should be on its list of priorities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma has opted out of the anti open grazing resolution of Southern governors after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, opting instead for collaboration between \u201cfarmers and herders\u201d in the state.\n\nRecall that the governors of 17 Southern states had after their meeting in Lagos on July 5, set September 1, 2021 target for states in the region to enact anti-open grazing legislation as a way of checking incessant killing and kidnapping by suspected herdsmen in the region.\n\nFollowing the governors\u2019 resolution, Delta, Osun, Ondo, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, and Enugu state governments had moved to enact anti-open grazing laws. But before the resolution of the governors, the anti-open grazing law was already operational in Ogun, Abia, Oyo, Ekiti, and Ebonyi states.\n\nHowever, Uzodinma yesterday declared that there is no law forbidding open grazing by cattle rearers in the state.\n\nSpeaking after meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, Uzodinma argued that though there is presently no anti-grazing law in the state, his government was trying to regulate grazing activities through collaboration between the farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any law in Imo State for anti-grazing. But what we have done is that we are regulating grazing activities in Imo State under a partnership between our farmers and herders. They have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in my office and agreed to work together. And both parties are going about their businesses without interfering or causing any grievance or anger to each other,\u201d Uzodinma said.\n\nThe governor also argued that the recent sit-at-home order given by the Independent People Of Biafra (IPOB) was not carried out in the state, saying people went about their normal businesses.\n\nHe further disclosed that the Igbo people are now ready to play national politics by belonging to the party at the centre, saying this would play out with the forthcoming gubernatorial election in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cTo the extent of what I know on the sit-at-home order, even the people on their own called off the sit-at-home order. In Imo State, it is not being observed. People are doing their businesses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost people in Imo are businessmen and women who depend on their daily activities and income to feed their families. So, they cannot afford to sit at home idle and allow hunger to ravage the state.\n\n\u201cI know in Imo State, there is only one Governor and only the governor can order, working with other members of the government, that people should sit at home and it will be obeyed. I don\u2019t want to sit here and recognise that there is any order outside the government of Imo State because there is a government.\n\n\u201cIPOB is not a government in Imo State. Imo State government has not authorised anything at all. Workers are going to work and normal business activities are ongoing. And for now, I told you that Imo State is relatively calm.\u201d",

We can see this from the fact that he has changed political party five times during his undistinguished career,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cEvery time he feels the wind may be blowing in a certain direction, he follows it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, for the good citizens of Benue State, the most dangerous direction he blows in today is that of sectarianism and ethnicity.\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to boost his sinking political fortunes, Ortom takes the cheapest and lowest route possible by playing on ethnic themes and in doing so knowingly causes deaths of innocent Nigerians by inciting farmers against herders, and Christians against Muslims.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Ortom stirs up hatred by targeting one single ethnic group in Nigeria \u2013 using language reminiscent of the Rwandan genocide.\n\n\u201cAs was the case in Rwanda where the then Hutu leaders of the country incited their countrymen against each other, claiming there was a \u201csecret Tutsi agenda\u201d over the Hutu, Ortom claims there is a \u201csecret Fulanization agenda\u201d over other ethnic groups in his state and in Nigeria. This is a copy of the language of Hutu Power \u2013 which falsely, and intentionally, accused the Rwandan Tutsi of plans to dominate the country.\n\n\u201cThis wicked talk is aimed at giving cover to his so called \u201cpolicy\u201d on the Ranches Establishment Law \u2013 which in reality is purely an act of denial of the law \u2013 intended to withhold rights and freedoms from one ethnic group alone, whilst inciting race hatred against them amongst all others\n\n\u201cThese are not the actions of a man who should be trusted with running public services or holding public office. For the governor of a major state in Nigeria to be politically driven by ethnic hatred is a stain on our country.\n\n\u201cThe good, and fair-minded people of Benue State deserve more than this, and we look forward to the next elections when they have an opportunity to restore its greatness.\u201d",

Mele Kyari, for providing a detailed analysis of the Medium Term Revenue Framework for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe legislative committee also said Kyari cleared the air on sensitive issues surrounding the operations of the NNPC and the oil industry.\n\n\u201cYou have made our day. The committee is better informed based on explanations provided by the GMD,\u201d Faleke said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKyari had in his presentation, provided a base oil price in the medium term as $57 per barrel for 2022, $61 per barrel for 2023 and $62 per barrel for 2023.\n\nKyari explained that the assumptions were arrived at after a careful appraisal of the three-year historical dated Brent Oil price average of $59.07 per barrel premised on Platts Spot Prices.\n\n\u201cPrice growth is to be moderated by the lingering concerns over COVID-19, increased energy efficiency, switching due to increased utilization of gas and alternatives for electricity generation. These are reflected in the Medium Term Revenue Framework, \u201d he said.\n\nKyari, however, implored the National Assembly to come up with a legislation against smuggling of petroleum products, noting that the NNPC already mobilised some federal agencies like the Customs, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Police, Civil Defence Corps and others, to find workable solutions to the menace.\n\nWhile commenting on the possibility of establishing NNPC Retail stations in neigbouring countries to curb illegal haulage of petroleum products across the border, Kyari said though the NNPC once considered the option, it had to jettison the idea when it became imperative that the measure would be counterproductive.\n\nHe explained that people who are smuggling are not looking for officially priced petroleum products.\n\nHe further noted that going ahead to establish NNPC retail stations would not yield the desired result since the people who take products across the border are not interested in selling at the official prevailing prices at approved stations but are interested in under-the-counter deals.",

Mele Kyari, for providing a detailed analysis of the Medium Term Revenue Framework for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe legislative committee also said Kyari cleared the air on sensitive issues surrounding the operations of the NNPC and the oil industry.\n\n\u201cYou have made our day. The committee is better informed based on explanations provided by the GMD,\u201d Faleke said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKyari had in his presentation, provided a base oil price in the medium term as $57 per barrel for 2022, $61 per barrel for 2023 and $62 per barrel for 2023.\n\nKyari explained that the assumptions were arrived at after a careful appraisal of the three-year historical dated Brent Oil price average of $59.07 per barrel premised on Platts Spot Prices.\n\n\u201cPrice growth is to be moderated by the lingering concerns over COVID-19, increased energy efficiency, switching due to increased utilization of gas and alternatives for electricity generation. These are reflected in the Medium Term Revenue Framework, \u201d he said.\n\nKyari, however, implored the National Assembly to come up with a legislation against smuggling of petroleum products, noting that the NNPC already mobilised some federal agencies like the Customs, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Police, Civil Defence Corps and others, to find workable solutions to the menace.\n\nWhile commenting on the possibility of establishing NNPC Retail stations in neigbouring countries to curb illegal haulage of petroleum products across the border, Kyari said though the NNPC once considered the option, it had to jettison the idea when it became imperative that the measure would be counterproductive.\n\nHe explained that people who are smuggling are not looking for officially priced petroleum products.\n\nHe further noted that going ahead to establish NNPC retail stations would not yield the desired result since the people who take products across the border are not interested in selling at the official prevailing prices at approved stations but are interested in under-the-counter deals.",

          "text": "The International Day for Remembrance of Slave Trade and its Abolition is annually observed on August 23 to remind people globally of the tragedy of the transatlantic slave trade. It gives people a chance to think about the historic causes, the methods, and the consequences of the slave trade.\n\nNigeria has a history of slavery which is now illegal both within and outside the country. However, certain traditions and religious practices have led to \u201cthe inevitable overlap between cultural, traditional, and religious practices as well as national legislation in many African states\u201d which\n\nhas had the power to exert extra-legal control over many lives resulting in Modern Day Slavery.\n\nFindings show that the most common forms of modern slavery in Nigeria are human trafficking and child labour. Because modern slavery is difficult to recognise, it has been difficult to combat this practice despite international and national efforts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecently, the federal government, the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) have decried increase in cases of human trafficking in the country in recent times.\n\nThe trio, while raising their voices against the menace, urged media organisations to ensure that message on trafficking is sustained in media space, until it reaches the nooks and crannies of the country to create needed national awareness on this menace.\n\nSpecifically, UNESCO revealed that over 150 million children are subject to child labour accounting for one in 10 children around the world. Speaking on the theme \u2018Modern Day Slavery, A National Question: Protecting the Future Generation\u2019 during an event to commemorate the day in Abuja, the cultural counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria, Li Xuda, said though the abolition of slavery happened a long time ago it still has its practical significance in our modern day\n\nsociety.\n\nHe, however, said the Chinese government was ready to work with Nigeria to halt Modern Day Slavery and also protect the future generation. He, therefore, urged all hands to be on deck to stop the menace.\n\nOn her part, the permanent secretary, Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Dr Ifeoma Anyanwutaku, tasked youth leaders and students to take the message of the campaign against Modern Day Slavery to schools, homes and neighbourhoods to sensitise Nigerians on the menace.\n\nThe secretary general, NAT-COM UNESCO, Idowu Olagunju says that Modern Day Slavery is not history as it still manifests today in form of \u201cchild labour, forced marriages, death bondage among others\u201d.\n\nQuoting the International Labour Organisation, he said \u201cmore than 40 million people worldwide are victims of Modern Day Slavery which includes minorities, migrants and indigenous people in the country.\u201d",

I\u2019m no expert in giving ways out of these challenges, but as I\u2019ve written in my book Neglected, especially on mental health disorders, awareness and education play major roles in the solutions.

Police Operatives and other sister agencies were immediately deployed to the area to restore peace and to fish out the perpetrators of the dastardly act.\u201d\n\nLalong condemns attack\n\nCondemning the attack in a statement, Plateau state Governor Simon Lalong said he was appalled by the development.\n\nA statement by his director of press, Dr. Makut Macham, said: \u201cGovernor Simon Bako Lalong is appalled by yet another isolated attack. which took place at Yelwa Zangam village of Jos North Local Government Area on Tuesday night where properties were destroyed and some persons killed.\u201d\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Governor totally condemns this barbaric act and directs security agencies who have already arrested 10 suspects in connection with the attack to intensify efforts in tracking down the other assailants and their sponsors in order to bring them to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proactive decision became necessary following eminent(sic) threat to lives and properties within the Local Government Area and the need to forestall the breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cIt will also enable security agencies deploy appropriately to maintain security as the search for the attackers of the villagers continues.\n\n\u201cThe Governor has appealed to the citizens of Jos North to cooperate with the Government by abiding to the 24-hour curfew commencing 4pm, 25th August 2021, as security agencies have been mandated to ensure that those who violate the curfew are arrested.\n\n\u201cAlso, the 6pm to 6am curfew in Jos South and Bassa LGAs still remains in place until further notice. Only people on essential duties such as health personnel, journalists, fire service and paramilitary and others, are to be exempted from the curfew but should carry means of identification with them at all times.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is calling for calm as he is seriously grieved by the attacks,\u201d the statement further added.\n\nIt said Lalong was furious over the incident which security reports indicated was carefully planned as the bridge linking the village was said to have been destroyed in order to deny security forces access to the area during the attack.\n\nHe sympathised with the affected people and called for calm, assuring them that they would get justice.\n\nDamaged bridge\n\nBlueprint can report that members of the Yelwan Mr. Bow community Tuesday morning complained of vandalisation of the main bridge that linked their communities.\n\nOur correspondent who was at the scene Tuesday morning met the people fixing the damaged wooden bridge.\n\nA community leader, Malam Ali Muhammad, told our correspondent that in the early hours of Tuesday, passersby reported to them that some miscreants vandalised the bridge.\n\nHe said the Jos paramount ruler, the Ujah Anaguta, and chairman of Jos North local government council intervened in the past conflicts where they both sued for peaceful living.\n\n\u201cWe are all at peace, as agreed, but suddenly this morning some people removed all the woods on our bridge, they mounted road block with stones, stick a red cap to indicate that no road.\n\n\u201cThis has brewed tension and we instantly informed the chairman of Jos North Local Government Council, we equally called the DPOs of Anguwan Rogo and Katako, who have all come and have seen what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the DPOs addressed the two communities on the need to leave in peace.\n\n\u201cWith this late night incident, it would therefore be right to say the hoodlums damaged the bridge to forestall rescue effort by security agents in event of any attack,\u201d the community leader said.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing that the bridge should be fixed to a standard level, and government should also construct the road which is not more than five kilometers, and links Bauchi Road with Zaria Road,\u201d he pleaded.",

If truly the claims in the said report emanated from the lawmaker, then we must state without mincing words that they are not only unfounded but a travesty of facts and reality. The claim is completely devoid of truth. It is most unfair for anyone at that height of the social ladder to sponsor a smear campaign against the Nigerian Army for whatever reason; particularly knowing that he has access to the leadership of the military.\n\n\u201cContrary to the narrative being peddled in the said report, it took the gallantry of our men on patrol to rescue the victims of the said kidnap incident before handing them over to the police. How then could the same Army that was instrumental to the rescue of the victims, turn around to order the release of the suspects. Evidently, this is illogical and a blatant lie.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army, therefore, wishes to state that the misguided report is actually an abysmally failed attempt at blackmailing the NA for denying unscrupulous elements the freedom of action to foist lawlessness and violence on the good people and government of Abia state.\n\n\u201cThe honorable lawmaker should have abinitio, sought clarifications from the Army before resorting to media trial. We, therefore, appeal to members of the public to approach the Army on any issue requiring clarification rather than resorting to blackmail\u201d.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01% (year-on-year) in real terms in the second quarter of 2021, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has said.\n\nThe NBS disclosed this in the latest report on the nation\u2019s GDP entitled Nigerian Gross Domestic Product Report (Q2 2021) released on Thursday.\n\nIt explained that the increase in the GDP index marked three consecutive quarters of growth following the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Reports Seven More Deaths, 637 New COVID-19 Cases\n\n\u201cThe Q2 2021 growth rate was higher than the -6.10% growth rate recorded in Q2 2020 and the 0.51% recorded in Q1 2021 year-on-year, indicating the return of business and economic activity near levels seen prior to the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions,\u201d the report read.\n\n\u201cThe steady recovery observed since the end of 2020, with the gradual return of commercial activity, as well as local and international travel, accounted for the significant increase in growth performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 when nationwide restrictions took effect.\n\n\u201cYear to date, real GDP grew 2.70% in 2021 compared to -2.18% for the first half of 2020.\u201d\n\nBut the real GDP (quarter-on-quarter) grew at -0.79% in Q2 2021 compared to Q1 2021, indicating slightly slower economic activity than the preceding quarter due largely to seasonality.\n\nIn the quarter under review, the NBS revealed that the aggregate GDP stood at N39,123,713.32 million in nominal terms \u2013 higher than the second quarter of 2020 with aggregate GDP of N34,023,197.60 million, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 14.99%.\n\nIt added that the nominal GDP growth rate in Q2 2021 was higher than -2.80% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2020 when economic activities slowed sharply at the outset of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe Q2 2021 nominal growth rate was also higher than 12.25% growth recorded in Q1 2021,\u201d the agency said.\n\nOil, Non-Oil Sectors\n\nIn the oil sector, the NBS disclosed that the average daily oil production stood at 1.61 million barrels per day (mbpd) in Q2 2021, saying the value was -0.19mbpd lower than the average daily production of 1.81mbpd recorded in the same quarter of 2020, and -0.10mbpd lower than the 1.72mbpd recorded in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIt stated that the real growth of the oil sector was \u201312.65% (year-on-year) in Q2 2021, indicating a decrease of \u20136.02% points relative to the growth rate recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020.\n\nData from the report showed that growth decreased by \u2013 10.44% points when compared to Q1 2021 which was \u20132.21%.\n\n\u201cFor the first half of 2021, real GDP was recorded at -7.13%, compared to -0.80% for the first half of 2020, the performance reflecting lower oil output.\n\n\u201cQuarter-on-quarter, the oil sector recorded a growth rate of -20.35% in Q2 2021. The Oil sector contributed 7.42% to total real GDP in Q2 2021, down from figures recorded in the corresponding period of 2020, and down compared to the preceding quarter, where it contributed 8.93% and 9.25% respectively,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe non-oil sector grew by 6.74% in real terms during the reference quarter (Q2 2021). The Q2 2021 growth rate was higher by 12.80% points compared to the rate recorded in the same quarter of 2020 and 5.95% points higher than the first quarter of 2021.\u201d\n\nThe NBS explained that during the quarter, the sector was driven mainly by growth in Trade, Information and Communication (Telecommunication), Transportation (Road Transport), Electricity, Agriculture (Crop Production) and Manufacturing (Food, Beverage & Tobacco), reflecting the easing of movement, business and economic activity across the country relative to the same period a year earlier.\n\n\u201cIn real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 92.58% to the nation\u2019s GDP in the second quarter of 2021, higher from shares recorded in the second quarter of 2020 which was 91.07% and the first quarter of 2021 recorded as 90.75%,\u201d the report said.",

          "text": "Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, has called for a state of emergency in the northern part of the country over the security challenges in the region.\n\nHe made the call on Wednesday at a meeting with the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 10, Ali Janga, at the Government House in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nThe governor who is seriously concerned about the series of attacks in many states in the region believes a declaration of a state of emergency will address the problem of insecurity in the North.\n\nNigeria\u2019s northern region comprises three geopolitical zones \u2013 North East, North West, and North-Central \u2013 and 19 states, as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nOver the years, parts of the region have been grappling with a series of criminal activities such as kidnapping, bombings, and attacks on communities as a result of insurgency and banditry.\n\nBefore now, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the region while millions were forced to flee their ancestral homes.\n\nBoko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) are largely responsible for the incidents in the North East, while bandits have continued to engage in kidnapping for ransom in the North West and parts of the North Central.\n\nSchools and security formations have been targets for the criminals, and the latest is the attack on the Nigeria Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna State.\n\nFor some persons of concern, including Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, there is a strong connection between the terrorists and the bandits.\n\nFollowing the meeting with the senior police officer on Wednesday, Governor Matawalle briefed the people of the state on the present security situation in Zamfara.\n\nRead the full text of the briefing below:\n\nMy dear people of Zamfara State.\n\nFollowing the recent upsurge in banditry attacks in some parts of our dear State, I feel compelled to address you on the new steps being taken by my administration to contain the situation.\n\nAs we all know, the primary objective of the state is to provide security for the lives of the people and their property. My primary motivation for running for the office of governor in 2019 is to devote myself to addressing the enormous and protracted security challenges faced by our dear state for over a decade.\n\nI wish to express my profound sympathies to all those who have lost their loved ones, property, and those who have been displaced and separated from their family. My heart goes to the women and children who have been forced to live in deplorable conditions of being widows, orphans and displaced as a result of the bandits\u2019 constant onslaught.\n\nOne can only imagine the constant state of misery and sleeplessness that our people are frequently experiencing. We must remain resolute in our efforts to contain this situation.\n\nEven though we were all aware of the bleak situation of Zamfara State before I took over as Governor in May 2019, it would not be inappropriate for me to take a trip down memory lane to remind us of it.\n\nMany parts of the state were literally governed by the bandits, who were having a field day in virtually all the rural areas of the state. Villages were being raided in the most inhumane manner possible-massacres carried out, and those who survived the attacks were subjected to all forms of indignities, including rape and torture.\n\nVirtually all markets were closed as traders could not risk their lives to attend the markets. There was a general sense of despondency everywhere, as the entire rural economy, which is largely agrarian, had collapsed, posing the threat of starvation. The rural Zamfara was a huge centre of humanitarian catastrophe with people left to their own devices.\n\nFrom day one, my administration took a close look at the situation and weighed the choices. Following extensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders, including traditional and religious leaders and security services, it was overwhelmingly agreed that the best way to address such a huge security challenge, which has the appearance of ethnic and inter-communal disharmony, is through dialogue and reconciliation with feuding parties. For example:\n\nWe have seen a remarkable precedent in the act of Prophet Muhammad, may the peace of Allah be upon him, where he brokered peace with Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj through the process of dialogue and reconciliation.\n\nIn our contemporary time, we have seen how the dialogue mechanism was used to end the Nigerian civil war, which raged between 1967 and 1970; the Lebanese civil war of 1975 to 1990; we have seen how peace mechanism worked between Tivs and Jukun and many other conflicts that are directly or indirectly linked to ethnicity in Nigeria.\n\nIt is evident from our experience in history that social eruptions and conflicts that border on ethnic or religious fault lines are better addressed through the instrument of dialogue instead of military or police action. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to such issues. In reality, experience has shown that they are better addressed via dialogue and reconciliation, as violence frequently leads to further violence.\n\nAs a fallout of our dialogue and reconciliation policy, hostilities between the bandits and Yansakai were immediately ceased. The state witnessed about nine months of peace; hundreds of kidnapped people were unconditionally released by their captives; hundreds of assorted arms and ammunition were surrendered by both the bandits and the Yansakai.\n\nThe state witnessed the rebirth of the glorious era of brotherhood, love and mutual coexistence between members of the Fulani ethnic group and the Hausas. For the first time, in more than a decade, the annual Sharu festival was held in Gusau in 2019.\n\nThe amazing successes of our peace efforts made our initiative appealing to some of the states sharing similar experiences as our state. Some of them opted for dialogue but eventually abandoned the programme after running into some issues.\n\nHowever, things took a dramatic turn, with the issue given political colouration by a section of politicians. Some people saw our progress as a threat to their political survival and began making disparaging efforts to undermine our achievements. Those acts of sabotage were the beginning of the ugly turn of events.\n\nThe primary hurdles to our peace efforts, based on my experience over the last two years, are:\n\nReluctance on the part of the affected states to engage in peace talks, which would have denied the recalcitrant bandits who are currently making life difficult for our people a safe passage through the region; lack of support from a section of politicians and conflict entrepreneurs that wish to take advantage of the situation to achieve political ends; and the need for the Federal Government to key into the peace initiative so that appropriate resources can be allocated to make it more comprehensive.\n\nMy good people of Zamfara state, you are living witnesses to all our unwavering commitments to peace. I have had cause to meet with Mr President on matters relating to the state\u2019s security on several occasions.\n\nI met the national security chiefs on numerous occasions. I have extended an olive branch to our political opponents in view of my conviction that attaining a lasting peace will require unity among all segments of society. Almost all my engagements outside the state are related to issues of security.\n\nIn taking my recent decision to move to the APC, my aim is to have an all-inclusive government where people with different political perspectives will put their hands together for the development of our dear state. I reached out to the notable political figures in the State and made known to them my desire to have a united front to confront and address the numerous issues of development affecting our state.\n\nI have made several political offers to the opposition because I have no mission far crucial than that of securing our state. This I have done despite vehement objection by my political associates. My belief has always been no amount of sacrifice is too much for peace.\n\nThis is why I took myself to the doorsteps of some political stakeholders with the aim of uniting ourselves to form a formidable team to address the disturbing security challenge bedevilling our dear State in the spirit of forging unity for the benefit of our dear state.\n\nApart from our peace and reconciliation efforts and the recent political developments, we have equally maintained our obligations to our security forces through the provision of logistical and all other supports they require to discharge their function.\n\nWe had an expanded Security Council meeting last Monday in furtherance of our steadfast efforts to confront this persistent challenge. The meeting was attended by all security chiefs, emirs, and the ulamas. I commend all of them for positively and sincerely offering their advice on how best to tackle the problems at hand.\n\nWe reviewed the effectiveness or otherwise of the current security measures aimed at containing the security challenge and received reports from members. Some of the observations and resolutions of the meeting that we can share with the public are:\n\nThe security agencies have given their assurances to the general public of commitment to protecting lives and property across the State, as well as their readiness for rapid and prompt response to distress calls;\n\nThe general public should therefore continue to cooperate and support the security forces to achieve the desired objective. We should appreciate the monumental sacrifices by our security agents and encourage them to work harder;\n\nSecurity is everyone\u2019s responsibility, People should, therefore, be vigilant and report any suspicious character to the appropriate authorities;\n\nIslamic scholars are called upon to intensify sermons and preaching on issues bordering on security, sanctity and inviolability of human life;\n\nThe conventional and new media practitioners should play a positive role in promoting peace and harmony and desist from disseminating unconfirmed and inciting reports that may jeopardise public security;\n\nPoliticians should join ranks and work in unison towards combatting the security challenge;\n\nApart from the measures outlined, the meeting has also agreed to take further tactical measures to effectively contain the challenging situation across the State.\n\nMy dear people of Zamfara State, I would like to use this opportunity to call on all of us to remain fervently prayerful for peace to reign in our State and the nation in general. We should ask Allah for forgiveness and His divine intervention.\n\nOnce again, I wish to extend my deep sympathy to those who sustained various degrees of injuries those recuperating in hospitals and at home. I wish them speedy recovery and good health. Government will continue to give them all medical and other necessary support.\n\nI reassure you that we are doing everything humanly possible to address this lingering challenge.\n\nI thank you all.\n\nWassalamu Alaikum",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s economy is 11% bigger than previously estimated after statistics authorities changed the way they calculate the gross domestic product.\n\nGDP at current prices measured 5.52 trillion rand ($369 billion) in 2020, compared with a previous estimate of 4.97 trillion rand, said Joe de Beer, deputy director-general of economic data at Statistics South Africa, told reporters Wednesday in the capital, Pretoria. The economy remains Africa\u2019s second-biggest, lagging behind Nigeria.\n\nThe upward revision means some key fiscal metrics, including the ratio of debt as a percentage of GDP, may now look better, De Beer said in an interview. Ratios in which GDP is the denominator will decline if the numerator remains the same, he said.\n\nThe revision means debt as a proportion of GDP will remain below 80% through 2023-24, Annabel Bishop, chief economist at Investec Bank Ltd said in a note. The government projected in February that the ratio would breach the 80% mark in the year through February 2021, and reach 87.3% in the 2024 fiscal year. The budget shortfall for the current fiscal year is now seen at 8.4% of GDP, compared with the National Treasury\u2019s estimate of 9.3%, Bishop said.\n\nThe statistics office altered its methodology for calculating the data by changing the reference year to 2015 from 2010, included new sources of information and refined its classification of activities to better reflect the structure of the economy.\n\nThe contribution of personal services to economic output more than tripled as a result of the changes, while that of the finance, real estate and business services industry is now 26% greater. General government\u2019s contribution decreased by 45%.\n\nHousehold consumption as a percentage of GDP is estimated to be 16% higher in the 2015 base year and GDP per capita is now revised to 79,913 rand, up from a previous estimate of 73,209 rand.\n\nThe size of Nigeria\u2019s economy was $375 billion in 2020. Its statistics office plans to publish overhauled GDP data in late 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023.",

          "text": "Japan suspended use of about 1.63 million doses of Moderna vaccine Thursday after contamination was found in unused vials, raising concern of a supply shortage as the country tries to accelerate vaccinations amid a COVID-19 surge.\n\nThe health ministry said contamination was reported from multiple vaccination sites. Some doses might have been administered, but no adverse health effects have been reported so far, officials said.\n\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Co., a Japanese drugmaker in charge of sales and distribution of the vaccine in Japan, said it decided to suspend use of doses manufactured in the same production line as a safety precaution.\n\nIt asked Moderna to conduct an emergency investigation and told medical institutions and organizers to stop using the vaccine produced in Spain and shared the production numbers that may be affected.\n\nThe health ministry and Takeda did not give details on the type of contamination or if the doses in question may have been distributed outside Japan.\n\nThe Moderna vaccine problem came just as Japan struggles with surging infections, with daily new cases hitting new highs in many parts of the country and severely straining the health care system.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters the government and Takeda are discussing ways to minimize the impact on Japan\u2019s vaccination progress.\n\n\u201cWe will do utmost in order to avoid any impact on vaccination progress, especially at worksites and large-scale centers,\u201d Kato said.\n\nJapan relies entirely on foreign-developed vaccines by Moderna, as well as Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca. Moderna has been since mid-June at large-scale centers and workplace inoculations and has helped speed up Japan\u2019s rollout.\n\nAbout 43% of the Japanese population have been fully vaccinated, with daily doses of about 1 million.",

          "text": "The United States and allies urged people to move away from Kabul airport on Thursday due to the threat of a terror attack by Islamic State militants as Western troops hurry to evacuate as many people as possible before an Aug. 31 deadline.\n\nPressure to complete the evacuations of thousands of foreigners and Afghans who helped Western countries during the 20-year war against the Taliban has intensified, with all U.S. and allied troops due to leave the airport next week.\n\nIn an alert issued on Wednesday evening, the U.S. embassy in Kabul advised citizens to avoid travelling to the airport and said those already at the gates should leave immediately, citing unspecified \u201csecurity threats\u201d.\n\nIn a similar advisory, Britain told people in the airport area to move away.\n\n\u201cThere is now very, very credible reporting of an imminent attack,\u201d British armed forces minister James Heappey told BBC radio.\n\n\u201cPeople should not come to Kabul airport, they should move to a safe place and await further instructions.\u201d\n\nAustralia also urged its citizens and visa holders to leave the area, warning of a \u201cvery high threat\u201d of an attack.\n\nA NATO diplomat at the airport and a Taliban official both said the threat came from Islamic State, though none of the three goverments had specified.\n\nA Western diplomat in Kabul said areas outside the airport gates continued to be \u201cincredibly crowded\u201d despite the warnings.\n\nThe Taliban, whose fighters are guarding the perimeter outside the airport, are enemies of the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), after an old name for the region.\n\n\u201cOur guards are also risking their lives at Kabul airport, they face a threat too from the Islamic State group,\u201d said a Taliban official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe warnings came against a chaotic backdrop in the capital, Kabul, and its airport, where a massive airlift of foreign nationals and their families as well as some Afghans has been underway since the Taliban captured the city on Aug. 15.\n\nWhile Western troops in the airport worked feverishly to move the evacuation as fast as possible, thousands of people still thronged outside, trying to flee rather than stay in a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\nAhmedullah Rafiqzai, an Afghan civil aviation official working at the airport, said people continued to crowd around the gates despite the attack warnings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy for a suicide bomber to attack the corridors filled with people and warnings have been issued repeatedly,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cBut people don\u2019t want to move, it\u2019s their determination to leave this country that they are not scared to even die.\u201d\n\nThe NATO country diplomat said that although the Taliban were responsible for security outside the airport, threats from Islamic State could not be ignored.\n\n\u201cWestern forces, under no circumstances, want to be in a position to launch an offensive or a defensive attack against anyone,\u201d the diplomat added. \u201cOur mandate is to ensure evacuations end on Aug. 31.\u201d\n\nThe other Western diplomat said flight operations had slowed on Wednesday but the pace of evacuations would hasten on Thursday.\n\nIt was unclear how many eligible people hoping to travel were left but one Western official said an estimated 1,500 U.S. passport and visa holders were trying to get to the airport.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden was briefed on Wednesday about the threat from the ISIS-K group as well as contingency plans for the evacuation.\n\nBiden has ordered all troops out of Afghanistan by the end of the month, to comply with a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, despite European allies saying they needed more time to get people out.\n\nIn the 11 days since the Taliban swept into Kabul, the United States and its allies have mounted one of the biggest air evacuations in history, bringing out more than 88,000 people, including 19,000 on Tuesday. The U.S. military says planes are taking off the equivalent of every 39 minutes.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at least 4,500 American citizens and their families had been evacuated from Afghanistan since mid-August.\n\nThe U.S. military said it would shift its focus to evacuating its troops in the final two days before the Aug. 31 deadline.\n\nThe Taliban have said foreign troops must be out by the end of the month. They have encouraged Afghans to stay, while saying those with permission to leave will still be allowed to do so once commercial flights resume after the foreign troops go.\n\nThe United Nations is leaving some 3,000 Afghan staff at its mission. A U.N. security document reviewed by Reuters described dozens of incidents of threats, the looting of U.N. offices and physical abuse of staff since Aug. 10.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s 1996-2001 rule was marked by public executions and the curtailment of basic freedoms. Women were barred from school or work.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will respect human rights and not allow terrorists to operate from the country.\n\nBut, with the twentieth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks looming, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told NBC News there was \u201cno proof\u201d that Al Qaeda\u2019s late leader Osama bin Laden was responsible.\n\nU.S.-backed forced ousted the Taliban weeks after those attacks as their leadership had refused to cave in to U.S. demands to make bin Laden leave his base in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence even after 20 years of war \u2026 There was no justification for this war,\u201d Mujahid said.",
