          "text": "The Sokoto State Government has denied diverting N189bn following reports published by some online news media.\n\nIn a press release signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Muhammad Bello, the state government described the reports as \u201cfalse in all material particulars\u201d and advised that they should be \u201ccompletely disregarded.\u201d\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to reckless and provoking reports by some online news media about alleged diversion of N189 Billion by the Sokoto State Government. The reports cited a so-called EFCC interim report on Sokoto State. These media reports are false in all material particulars and should be completely disregarded.\u201d\n\nThe state government said that the online news media reports were \u201cefforts by political hacks\u201d targeted at tainting the reputation of the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who also is an aspirant for the position of the Nigerian President in the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWe alert the public that these media reports are products of orchestrated efforts by political hacks to taint the reputation of Governor Aminu Tambuwal, who is a frontline aspirant for 2023 PDP Presidential ticket. The Government of Sokoto State has established deserved reputation as the champion of budget transparency, fiscal responsibility, and open governance. We have subscribed to the Open Government Partnership.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that in December 2020, the World Bank rated Sokoto State as number one state in Nigeria in fiscal transparency as a recognition of Governor Tambuwal\u2019s unflinching commitment to the implementation of the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability and for efforts to champion budgetary transparency in Nigeria. For this commitment, Sokoto State has received up to $34.1million as special grant from the World Bank.\n\n\u201cGovernor Tambuwal in pursuit of fiscal responsibility and anticorruption in management of public finance in Sokoto State has created the Sokoto State Bureau of Public Procurement and Private Partnership and Fiscal Responsibility Commission to review and investigate all public expenditure. The agencies are independent agencies established by law.\n\n\u201cTo further strengthen vertical and horizontal agencies of accountability in the state, Governor Tambuwal has signed law granting the Offices of Auditor General in the state and local government councils in Sokoto State operational independence to investigate all records of public expenditure in Sokoto State,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe statement further stated that it invited anyone who wished to investigate the financial of the state to feel free to request the report of the Sokoto State Bureau of Public Procurement and Private Partnership on all public expenditures in Sokoto State.\n\nIt also stated that the state government was \u201cready with all relevant documents to challenge any report from the EFCC or any other anticorruption body on the public finances of Sokoto State.\u201d\n\nIt added that \u201cthe public (should) disregard these malicious attacks on Governor Tambuwal and desperate efforts to derail the Tambuwal mission to offer Nigeria an open and transformative governance.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

It is in this regard that we developed a robust and functional ICT ecosystem for GoHealth.\n\n\u201cFrom the demonstration of the GoHealth mobile App we just witnessed, it is clear that the App is user-friendly, safe, and secure. It is meant to enable individuals and groups to enroll into the scheme, book appointments with their care providers, make enquiries as well as provide feedback to enable the government to take necessary measures to improve the quality of service.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, the Executive Secretary of National Health Insurance Scheme, Prof. Mohammed Sambo, said the fund came into being following the government\u2019s determination to attain Universal health coverage.\n\nSambo said, \u201cIt is unthinkable to operate a functional healthcare system without the introduction of Information Communication and Technology. When Healthcare services are enhanced in the country the life expectancy of its citizens will surge, thereby eliminating avoidable health complications leading to untimely death.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Executive Director of LISDEL, Juliana Abude-Aribo, commended the government\u2019s deliberate efforts at improving its health care services, while urging for increased funding\n\nShe said, \u201cThere should be complete disbursement of Gombe State equity for health, strengthening of institutional government structure of primary healthcare for optimal delivery.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chairman, Saif Advocacy Foundation, Alhassan Yahya lauded the governor\u2019s resolve at improving primary healthcare, especially for the poor and vulnerable, adding that they have better opportunities of accessing qualitative support.\n\nHe said, \u201cThank you very sincerely your excellency for closing the gap between the rich and the vulnerable.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Hon Sheriff Oborevwori, Thursday, promised to consolidate on the achievements of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa when elected as Governor in 2023.\n\nOborevwori who spoke at the Ogwashi-Uku, Agbor and Owa-Oyibu, Aniocha South, Ika South and Ika North East Local Government Areas, respectively in continuation of his consultation visits, assured that he would run an inclusive government as currently being done by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nSpeaking to PDP leaders, critical stakeholders and delegates, he said his vision for the state if elected Governor in 2023 is to keep the state above other states in all aspects.\n\nHear him: \u201cMy vision if elected the Governor of Delta State next year is to keep our dear state ahead of other states. Our Governor is running an inclusive government and that is what I will equally do if voted into power as governor. There will be fairness and equity and we will build on what our governor is doing at the moment.

          "text": "Former Chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Attahiru Jega said good leadership recruitment has been the missing point in the quest for national development, urging Nigerians to as a matter of urgency find a solution pathway before the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nJega spoke during the pre-Ramadan lecture organised by the University of Lagos Muslim Alumni (UMA) with the theme, \u201cLeadership Recruitment \u2013 The Missing Anchor in Our National Development\u201d held at main auditorium of the institution, Akoka, Lagos.\n\n\n\nDelivering the keynote address, Prof Jega noted that the disposition of politicians who dominate and control governance and political processes runs the country totally aground, beyond redemption or salvation.\n\n\n\nHe said Nigerians must pick up the gauntlet to salvage the situation for national development.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the issue of leadership recruitment at all levels of governance in the country, is central to current national predicament; and getting it right is key to the resolution of poor governance and development processes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not too late now to do so; we must pick up the gauntlet, as we are truly running out of time. We must contribute to the development of a criteria to be used to mobilize citizens for good leadership recruitment for the 2023 general elections and beyond. This is a task that must be done.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe must develop an overwhelming consensus that political leadership cannot remain the only job for which no qualification appears necessary except to have a lot of money, usually, stolen money. It is clear that for as long as the current pattern of leadership recruitment continues, our troubles will continue. It is for this reason that we must find a way to bring relevant criteria to bear on the selection of leadership. We have got to find a way of making character, competence and capacity to determine who leads.\n\n\n\nFormer Minister of Education Dr Oby Ezekwesili who was one of the eminent speakers said Nigeria lacked right leadership.\n\n\n\nDr Ezekwesili stated that the country produced leaders who are at peace with compromising public goods for personal interest and subvert the common goods.\n\n\n\nThis pattern of behaviour, she said, will lead the country to the lowest common denominator in leadership\n\n\u201cA country can be said to move in the right direction if she carries out the right policies and adhere to the rule of law. Adherence to the rule of law means impunity cannot be tolerated,\u201d she said.\n\nUMA, Islam and leadership\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, UMA President Alhaji Shuaib Salisu said the theme was carefully chosen to evolve a better society and address the generally acknowledged leadership challenge at all levels.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is near unanimity that if our great Nation, Nigeria, must attain its full potentials, then there is the need to fix the leadership challenge. And in doing so, we must look beyond individual leaders and focus on the process through which leaders emerge,\u201d Salisu said:\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Islam places so much premium on the importance of leadership, which is based on the principle of trust (Amanah) and offers broad definitions of leaders.\n\nThere should be mechanism for assessment, accountability \u2014 Shayjh Ahmad\n\nChief Missioner of Ansar-Ud-Deen Society Worldwide, Shaykh Ahmad AbdurRahman said the leadership recruitment process in the country is faulty.\n\n\n\nShaykh Ahmad called for regular assessment of appointed/elected leaders and ease out those not performing.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, there should be mechanism to bring them to account.\n\nHe also called on religious leaders to be truthful as they also have great roles to play in fixing government.\n\n\n\nVice Chancellor, University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said negligence of knowledgeable and able citizens in the quest for leadership in Nigeria had led to the present predicament.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe poor go out to vote, why the rich sit back to watch and count,\u201d he said.\n\nOgundipe stressed the importance of citizens, including students, to know their citizenship roles and right, and the importance of good leadership in the country.\n\n\n\nPetroleum Economist/lecturer at the Department of Economic, Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua University, Katsina, Dr. Ahmed Adamu, noted that to have a good governance, leadership recruitment systems require an evolutionary change.\n\n\n\nHe added that good citizenship, particularly voters, being the most important element in leadership recruitment, should endeavour to carry out their rights by going for their Voter\u2019s Card, come out to vote, not to sit back and count the number of votes at home.\n\n\n\nHe said politicians and delegates should check their intentions, and also do the right thing.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Nwafor Sunday\n\nAs the Lekki Concession Company, LCC, plans to resume toll collection on the Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge, Nigerians have on Friday advised the Lagos state government to jettison the plan, noting that people must get justice before the resumption of toll collection.\n\nA songwriter, musician and Disc jockey, Obianuju Catherine Udeh, popularly known as DJ Switch has come open again to demand for justice especially for those killed during the Endsars incident at the Lekki-Tollgate.\n\nAccording to her @dj_switchaholic, \u201c\u270a\ud83c\udffe give the people what we want! Justice, not tolls!\u201d\n\nDJ Switch was not the only one as Savvy Rinu, human rights activist and social media influencer who represented the youth on the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry probing alleged shooting of #EndSARS protesters by soldiers at the Lekki toll gate, lend her voice.\n\nIn her words @SavvyRinu\n\n\u201cI pray Nigerians do not allow the enablers of the bloodshed go scotfree.\n\nEveryone must pay, even if they are no longer in government.\n\nNigerians must not forget!\n\n@akintollgate\n\nWe don\u2019t want protests, We don\u2019t want more protests, No one needs any more protests !\n\nImplement the Judicial Panel Report & Keep the toll gate free!\n\n@ayfbeloved\n\nHow can we talk about lekki tollgate without the massacre\u2026\u2026.. #Nojusticenotoll\n\n@AyowoleSanyaolu\n\nOut of desperation for Money, you killed hundreds of our friends, injured many more and jailed scores of others. You denied this open crime until you were exposed by a panel you put together to cover your trails. #NoJusticeNoToll\n\n@trendwithola\n\nDear Gov @jidesanwoolu of @followlasg: Happy New Month sir, May your April be better than March. A quick reminder, I hope the reopening of the Lekki TollGate is #AprilFoolsDay because our stand is #NoJusticeNoToll. You\u2019re FREE to reopen where there\u2019s Justice for #ENDSARS victims\u201d.\n\nHowever, the residents of the Lekki area of the Lagos metropolis, under aegis of Lekki Estates Residents and Stakeholders Association (LERSA), also called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to halt the proposed resumption of toll collection on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge.\n\nIn a letter signed by the President and General Secretary of the association, Olorogun James Emadoye and Mr. Gbemi Adelekan, the residents stated that the resumption of tolling will impose great financial hardship on users of the bridge.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, graciously permit us to exemplify our fears as follows: For a couple living off Freedom Way, Lekki 1, husband working in Obalende and wife working on Osborne Road, Ikoyi. Husband with SUV at N400 per trip (return) at day 30 days a month totals N24,000. Wife with a Toyota Corolla at N250 per trip (return) at day 30 days a month totals N15,000. Family annual budget for tolling is N468,000. We believe this is extremely unfair to us in Lekki.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that other infrastructure in other parts of the state were also funded through borrowing. We, therefore, do not understand why Lekki people must be the people to pay construction debts through tolling. We, therefore, implore the state government to reconsider the decision to reopen tolling.\n\n\u201cWe pray that the government will have a rethink on this matter and listen to the yearnings of residents and road users to rescind the toll payment that LCC is planning to perpetuate on peaceful, long-suffering taxpayers of this axis. We are also calling for an enlarged stakeholders\u2019 meeting to provide opportunity for a proper re-evaluation of this matter,\u201d LERSA said.",

          "text": "The Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami, has commended all the agencies in the communications and digital economy sector for being dedicated to the implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030 and urged them to work collaboratively and co-ordinately in order to achieve the Federal Government\u2019s strategic objectives as articulated in NDEPS.\n\nPantami stated this at a retreat organised by the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (FMoCDE) for senior management staff of the Ministry and all its agencies which commenced on March 31, 2022.\n\nThe retreat was convened to evaluate the implementation of NDEPS in the context of what has been achieved, what needs to be achieved, and what processes should be emplaced to enhance the capacity of the Ministry and Agencies it superintends to mobilise all stakeholders to accomplish the objectives of NDEPS. The retreat took place at the Nigerian Army Officers Wives Association (NAOWA) Centre at Mambilla Barracks, Abuja.\n\nCiting the most recent report of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Minister in his keynote and opening address told the forum that synergy among stakeholders in terms of co-operative posture, collaboration, coordination, deployment of social skills such as good listening skills, critical and analytical thinking, emotional intelligence, as well as project management and quality assurance skills, are central to organisational effectiveness, successes and the future of work, as projected by WEF. Pantami then urged all the agencies and their staff to challenge themselves to do more rather than think of themselves as competitors.\n\nAlso speaking at the retreat, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (EVC/CEO) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta asserted that the NCC has acted superlatively in implementing NDEPS and in the context of the vision of Federal Government and the supervision of the Ministry.\n\nDanbatta who made clearly methodical presentation that chronologically documented NCC accomplishments under each of the eight (8) pillars of NDEPS, cited 10 of the 16 regulations that have been instituted in giving expression to the government\u2019s vision on developmental regulation, which is the first pillar of NDEPS.\n\nThese regulations were focused on Enforcement Processes, Lawful Interception, Quality of Service, Competition Practices, Licensing Regulations, and Universal Access and Universal Service among others.\n\nDanbatta promised to also complete the review of the remaining soonest and activate their implementation.\n\nDanbatta, who used a triangulation method in contextualising the achievement of NCC under the first pillar, itemised the guidelines, regulations and policy development initiatives to discharge the burden of proof of NCC\u2019s effectiveness in the regulation of ICT and digital economy sector through approaches that enabled development.\n\nIn implementing Digital Literacy and Skills, the second pillar, Danbatta also stated in his clearly explanatory presentation, that the Digital Bridge Institute (DBI), set up by NCC in 2004, had trained 5,352 students through 49 institutions, provided educational training software to 398 secondary schools, and endowed 7 professorial chairs in various Nigerian universities across all the geopolitical zones.\n\nOn Solid Infrastructure, the third pillar of NDEPS, Danbatta stated that broadband penetration as at December 2021 was 40.88 percent, thus enabling 80 million Nigerians to have access to broadband services.\n\nTo reinforce the intensity of NCC\u2019s commitment to improving broadband penetration, the EVC declared to the forum that NCC has emplaced a process for the deployment of optic fibre cable using Infrastructure Companies (Infracos).\n\nDanbatta was emphatic that the licensed Infracos have been directed by the Commission to commence immediate rollout without recourse to counterpart funding because the licence issued to them is independent of the counterpart funding agreement. The Infracos are expected to lay 38,296Km of fibre optic cable.\n\nAlso, in keeping with Government\u2019s directive through a Federal Executive Council decision of 2005, NCC has constructed 32 Emergency Communication Centres (EECs) in various states, and 32 of those have been activated and are operational. Prof. Danbatta also documented copiously in his presentation, Commission\u2019s achievement in the other five pillar areas.\n\nDr. Armstrong Takang, an innovative and technology-for-development specialist, who presented the lead paper as a guest speaker, praised the Federal Government for concretely aligning ICT, and digital economy with national economic imperatives.\n\nAdditionally, he commended NCC for driving the necessary infrastructure purposely and strategically, and for its effectiveness in regulating the telecom sector.\n\nTakang, citing Lagos State and the Federal Capital Territory Administration as good models, Takang emphasised the correlates of adoption of technology or automation in economic growth and effective governance, crediting technology for improved internally-generated revenue in Lagos State.\n\nTakang recommended that Nigeria must link technology to specific programmes that are impacting and sustainable. He also asserted that Nigeria needs to undertake pilots for projects that are planned for implementation and utilise the results of the pilots to scale up and for budgeting.\n\nTakang also bemoaned the human capital challenge in the ICT sector in Nigeria, insisting that at least 500,000 software engineers are required to redirect efforts for the effectiveness of the policy.\n\nThe Director overseeing the Office of the Permanent Secretary in FMoCDE, Engr. Abubakar Ladan, and the following CEOs of the other agencies in the Ministry also made presentations on their efforts and activities towards accomplishing the objectives of NDEPS: Mr. Ayuba Shuaibu, Acting Executive Secretary, Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF); Dr. Abimbola Alale, Managing Director of Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), represented by Engr. Abdulrahman Adajah; Engr. Aliyu Aziz, Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC); Kachifu Inuwa Abdullahi, Director General, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA); Prof. Muhammed Abubakar, Managing Director, Galaxy Backbone Plc; Dr. Adebayo Adewusi, Postmaster General of the Federation and Managing Director, Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST); and Dr. Vincent Olatunji, National Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB). All the agencies and the Ministry were well represented at the retreat by at least 6 officers in the directorate cadre.",

I\u2019m speaking as the Lord directs not out of a biased mind. They don\u2019t know what to do; they are weak and tired. This is not banditry; it\u2019s terrorism. These things can consume 2023 if not handled with care and I foresee it extending to other parts of the country if it\u2019s not curtailed now.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that there are people behind the security crisis in Nigeria but they have not been addressed.\n\nAyodele said the crisis would start extending to other parts of the country, and when it does, Nigeria will be a total mess.",

Gbenga Komolafe revealed thesd at the 2022 Oloibiri Lecture Series and Energy Forum (OLEF) in Abuja.\n\nThe theme of the event, which was organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) was: \u201cGlobal Energy Transition: Implications on Future Investments in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry.\u201d\n\nHis Special Technical Adviser, Mr. Abel Nsa represented him.\n\nHe said: \u201cSome of these projects, including the Preowei project, the Bonga South West Aparo project, the Bonga North project, and a host of others, when completed, all have the combined capacity to add upwards of 800,000 BOPD to Nigeria\u2019s production figures.\u201d\n\nHe noted to meet the increasing global energy demand, the Federal Government was set to embark on further exploration.\n\nIt has also planned to embark on development drilling in its bid to optimize reservoir extraction.\n\nThe Federal Government is also ready to drill into new targets and employ technological advances to increase production outputs for appropriate energy mix.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven this outlook, it is evident to note that in meeting the growing energy demand in the short and medium term, we would need to carry out further exploration and development drilling to optimize reservoir extraction, drill into new targets, and employ technological advances to maximize production yields for appropriate energy mix.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that the global energy transition is here to stay and poses great challenges to future investments in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nOn the other hand, Komolafe said \u201cbut it is not all gloomy as we are working assiduously to mitigate every negative impact.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said the risk of limited international financing could jeopardise Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and roadmap to attaining net-zero.\n\nRecalling that firms have discouraged investment in the hydrocarbon industry, he said: \u201cWe have seen policies and\n\npronouncements at governmental and corporate levels aimed at discouraging\n\ninvestment in fossil fuels.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Permanent Secretary, Dr. Sanu Gwarzo that represented him said: \u201cWe have seen decisions by some IOCs to reduce or outrightly stop long-term investments in upstream projects and development of new\n\ntechnologies for exploration, production and processing of crude oil, or servicing\n\nthe existing technologies. \u201cPenalties may soon be put on the production and use of fossil fuels, directly or indirectly, in order to bridge the gaps that may be created by large taxes raked by developed countries from the consumption of oil.\n\n\u201cAdequate financial resources, technology development and effective policies designed to encourage investments in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria, are required to enable us meet our increasing demand for energy.\u201d\n\nHe informed the stakeholders that\n\nNigeria has very low levels of carbon emissions \u2013 0.61t CO2e per capita (2020) which compares to 14.24t CO2e per capita in the USA and 4.85t CO2e per capita in the UK.",

Train services are now suspended between Abuja and Kaduna,\u201d the FCDO said.\n\nThe FCDO further said there is a threat from extremists linked to Boko Haram or the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in particular.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cThe threat level in North East Nigeria, including around Maiduguri is increasing, particularly around transport hubs, religious areas and large gatherings. Kidnaps have taken place on the roads in and out of Maiduguri. As the dry season starts in October, this risk is expected to increase even further.\n\n\u201cIf the security situation in Maiduguri were to deteriorate any further, there is a significant likelihood that it could be extremely difficult for you to leave the city. We do not advise travelling by road.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cFCDO advise against all but essential travel to: Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Niger, Sokoto states; and within 20km of the border with Niger in Kebbi State. There is a high risk of violent attacks and inter-communal tensions can lead to outbreaks of violence. There is also a threat of kidnap,\u201d FCDO said.\n\nFCDO also said anyone who travels to areas to which it advised against travel, that person is particularly at risk and will need a high level of security.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re working in northern Nigeria you should make sure your employers provide an adequate level of security where you live and where you work. Make sure they regularly review security arrangements and familiarise yourself with those plans. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to travel only during daylight hours. Westerners have been kidnapped from protected compounds,\u201d FCDO said.\n\nThe FCDO recalled that from September 3, 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission mandated all telecommunication operators in Nigeria to stop extending services to Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThis included the suspension of all mobile telecommunications, including WiFi. A number of other state governments, including Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger also implemented a partial shutdown of telecom services. There are reports that some of these restrictions have been lifted, with Nigerian media reporting that communications in Kaduna and Zamfara states have been restored as of December 2021.\n\n\u201cDespite the reported restoration of communications in some states, future shutdowns may happen at short notice and may also be extended to new areas without advanced notice.\n\n\u201cAlthough not officially included in the suspension, there is a possibility that areas of neighbouring states to Zamfara, including state border regions with Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger and Kaduna may also be affected by the telecommunications black-out.\n\n\u201cRegular military operations are ongoing in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. If you live or work in Nigeria, you should monitor developments in these states and announcements by the state governments as there is an increased threat of retaliatory attacks elsewhere in Nigeria as a result of these military operations. There has been an increase in insurgent attacks in Borno State. Since October 2019, there has been an increasing trend of terrorist groups constructing illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in northern Nigeria and attacking vehicles travelling on major roads into Maiduguri, Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have directly targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers. Furthermore, 2020 has seen increased activity by terrorist groups and related violent incidents in the immediate vicinity of humanitarian hubs. A humanitarian hub was targeted during an attack on Monguno town on June 13, 2020. This was followed by negative propaganda about humanitarian activity in the North East. In July 2020, shots were fired at a UN humanitarian helicopter in the region. Local humanitarian staff were executed in an unrelated event.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the North East against FCDO advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation and make sure your procedures and contingency plans are up to date.\u201d",

The lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd). They accused the security agencies of profiting from the increasing insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, House Majority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, accused the government of failing to live up to expectations. Ado-Doguwa suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms in self-defence.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, decried some of the public words of the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. The main opposition party said such words tended to confirm its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts as well as plans of the terrorists, and deliberately refused to act.\n\n\n\nThe air interdiction came as troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) killed scores of insurgents during a clash in the Lake Chad area.\n\nNigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial deliveries, to aid the fight against terrorism.\n\n\n\nA military update issued in Abuja, yesterday, said 34 terrorists were decimated in waves of air strikes.\n\nThe update said, \u201cIn receiving credible information that at about 2.pm on 30 March 2022, about 70 terrorists on 40 motorcycles and some on foot were sighted moving towards the Akilibu-Sarkin Pawa Road, near Mangoro Village, the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike swiftly scrambled an aircraft to intercept and neutralise the terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the aircraft approached the scene, several terrorist were seen running in disarray on sighting the aircraft, abandoning their motorcycles to take cover within nearby bushes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe terrorists were subsequently engaged in different waves with rockets while those fleeing were mopped up with canons decisively. Feedback from local sources around Mangoro Village, disclosed that 17 motorcycles including 34 dead bodies as well as 14 locally fabricated guns belonging to the terrorist were recovered.\u201d\n\nA source said some of the terrorists fled with multiple gunshot wounds during the encounter, but it was still unclear what roles they played in the attack that killed eight passengers onboard the Kaduna-bound train, with many injured and undetermined number abducted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an emergency intelligence meeting coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency after the train attack identified three locations as \u201cdestinations\u201d of bandits after most attacks within the axis.\n\nThe meeting, according to PRNigeria, also considered immediate deployment of integrated security surveillance and monitoring solutions for the rail line.\n\n\n\nThe locations identified by the intelligence service as bandit dens are in Rijana, Katari and Kasarami.\n\nThe places have proximity to the Kaduna-Abuja highway and rail lines.\n\n\u201cThese locations are abodes to kidnappers, armed bandits, drug addicts, gun runners, prostitutes and fleeing Boko Haram terrorists,\u201d a senior intelligence source revealed.\n\nThe officer further disclosed that a \u201cmassive joint security operation\u201d would commence in the areas, simultaneously with the support of recently acquired drones.\n\n\n\nThe source added, \u201cSome of the services have recently acquired sophisticated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the drones to improve surveillance and ensure precisions on attacks on targets.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate collateral damages in the initial stages of the operation, even though we will ensure maximum protection of innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cProper identification exercises of people in the areas would be conducted.\u201d\n\nThe meeting of the intelligence operatives was on the heels of a security parley between President Muhammadu Buhari and the service chiefs.\n\n\n\nBuhari had given the service chiefs the marching order to find lasting solutions to the incessant attacks on motorists and train passengers by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nPrior to their meeting with Buhari, the duo of Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, and Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruq Yahaya, undertook an assessment visit to the scene of the attack.\n\n\n\nIn another development, troops of the MNJTF, Operation Hadin Kai, eliminated scores of fighters of terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the on-going clearance operations around Lake Chad region.\n\nSecurity sources said troops successfully cleared Cemente, Bagadaza, Zanari and Wulgo in Gamborun Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\n\n\nA source said, \u201cThere were two encounters with the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgents at Zanari and also at the harbour area. Troops were decisive in both attacks.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the troops also rescued 21 women, 11 male children and nine female children in the operations, which commenced on March 28, 2022.\n\n\n\nSome of the items recovered in the aftermath of the encounter included two gun trucks, 22 bicycles, 18 motorcycles (destroyed in situ), two Rockets Propelled Grenade (RPG) tubes, three Rockets Propelled Grenade Bombs, one NBST Gun, two General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), three GPMG belts, 600 rounds of 7.62 MM NATO, and one FN Rifle magazine, among others.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial delivery.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a courtesy visit to the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGoF), Surv. Abudulganiyu Adeyemi Adebomehin, the Chief of Intelligence of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Abubakar Liman, said the purpose of his visit was to seek areas of further collaboration with OSGoF, because of its expertise, skills and data required to aid NAF in its operations.\n\n\n\nHe solicited synergy with relevant authorities especially, in the war against insecurity, stating that, \u201csecurity is everyone\u2019s business. War is a national assignment,\u201d which required the support of every citizen.\n\nThe intelligence chief reiterated the significance of the role of OSGoF in the war against criminality in the country.\n\n\n\nIn his response, Adebomehin said OSGoF, an extra-ministerial establishment of the federal government as the apex mapping arm and responsible for implementing the survey coordination act of the country, was ready to provide all resources at its disposal for the success of the operations of NAF and other arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces. He disclosed that his office produced navigational charts for the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), which was certified by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). He added that OSGoF had acquired more sophisticated equipment and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as a digital printing outfit.\n\n\n\nAdebomehin stressed that the surveyors and other staff were already undergoing series of training and retraining in readiness to provide geo-spatial needs of the government, its MDAs, and other sectors of the economy.\n\nOutraged Lawmakers Say Nowhere is Safe in Nigeria\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives, yesterday, expressed concerns over the worsening insecurity in the country, lamenting that nowhere is safe in the country anymore. Reacting to the recent attacks by terrorists on Kaduna airport and train, the lawmakers, while debating a motion of urgent national importance on the killings in Giwa, took turns to fault the security agencies and the federal government for their failure to end killings by terrorists and other criminal elements.\n\n\n\nHon. Shehu Balarabe (APC, Kaduna), while moving his motion, lamented that his local government had been ravaged by the series of attacks by bandits, who indulged in killings, kidnapping, raping, robbery and destruction of property. He said between 24 and 28 of March, bandits had unleashed attacks on those communities, killing over 117 people, while some corpses were yet to be recovered.\n\nThe lawmaker also claimed that more than 136 people were abducted, while over 10, 463 others had been displaced from their homes.\n\n\n\nContributing, Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau) called for suspension of funds appropriated for security agencies until they showed what they had achieved with what had been released to them over the years.\n\nMajority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms to defend themselves. He said, \u201cI arise to speak in the capacity of the Majority Leader, who of course, is the ambassador of government on this floor. When you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government, especially, a democratic one which was elected by the people is to ensure safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis, those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but we continue day in, day out \u2013 killings, massacre, armed robbery all over \u2013 left, right and centre. Government in this case has to rise up to its responsibility, call a spade, a spade.\n\n\u201cOn account of this institutional failure, regimental failure on the part of our security agencies, because you have just no cause to raise excuse, funding is provided, here we are now as an institution, we have now sent invitation, come and meet with the people of Nigeria, come and interface with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, I think Nigerians should this moment be allowed to also take arms. Nigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard earned properties, because it is like a monumental failure, if the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failure.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet Nigerian organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let\u2019s organise defence for their innocent souls, because if the responsibility of the government cannot be carried out democratically, then, everyone has the cause to defend himself. Nigerians should no longer be running away from attacks, unnecessary bandits.\u201d\n\nAhmed Jaha (APC, Borno) was of the view that security matter in Nigeria has become a cash cow business, accusing security agencies of profiting from it.\n\n\n\nJaha said, \u201cIn 2021, we budgeted N460 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only N29 billion was for capital expenditure, the remaining was for recurrent expenditure. In 2022, we budgeted N571 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only 37 billion is capital expenditure, the remaining were recurrent expenditure.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr speaker the truth of the matter is security in Nigeria has become a cash cow business. I am not willing to go without taking my own and he is not willing to go without taking his own and the other person is not willing to leave until when he got his own.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a cash cow business. They don\u2019t want it to finish, because they will realise that everybody\u2019s attention was diverted towards north-east. Okay, let them release north-east to some extent and go to north-west, after north-west, they move to south-west. Before you realise what is happening, the whole country is gutted with security challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after being chided by Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, he withdrew his comment and said he was not going to deal with him.\n\nBut Hon. Nasiru Ali Ahmed (APC, Kano) called for the sack or resignation of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), for failing to curb insecurity in the country. Ahmed recalled when the service chiefs were sacked and IG of Police changed, adding that no one was indispensable.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSince 2015, the inspector general of police, service chiefs have been changed. But the NSA has not been changed. The Army, Navy, Police, DSS all of these agencies are accountable to the National Security Adviser. From what I heard, most of these criminals were 16, 18 years old boys. Are we saying that the Nigerian Army, police, DSS, Air Force with all the training that they have had, all the international training, they have gone for peacekeeping.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre they now saying these 18 years old boys are more powerful than them? You travel by road, you are kidnapped; you go by train, you are kidnapped; you sit at home, you\u2019re kidnapped. So, where are we going to stay. You can be kidnapped right in this chamber. I\u2019m calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser, he must be removed. He has been there for seven years, what has happened?\u201d\n\nWase, who presided over the session, however, disagreed with Ahmed, saying, calling for the sack of NSA might not be the solution to the issue. He noted that despite President Muhammadu Buhari changing the service chiefs, nothing has changed to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nWhile blaming the judiciary for not prosecuting arrested culprits, he assured the people that the parliament would continue their investigative duties and anyone found wanting would not be spared, suggesting that activities for the day be suspended and prayers offered in solidarity with the lives lost to insecurity across the country.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, urged the federal government to implement recommendations contained in the House security summit, held last year.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos), told THISDAY that his committee and other security committees of the House would engage with the heads of the various services with a view to thoroughly and effectively analysing the incident (and other similar occurrences), proffering and implementing lasting and sustainable solutions.\n\n\n\nBenson said, \u201cThe recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train is yet another sad and regrettable security breach. As a committee, we are saddened and highly disturbed by the incident and the brazen audacity of the bandits. We believe that Nigerians should enjoy adequate security everywhere they go. We, therefore, see this as a major setback that must be addressed immediately, especially, considering the current fear of traveling by road along that route.\u201d\n\nHouse Beams Searchlight on Own Security Committees\n\nThe House of Representatives resolved to look into the activities of its standing committees on security, to see how effectively they were carrying out their oversight functions on the security agencies.\n\n\n\nThe committees included Navy, Army, Air Force, Defence, Interior and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nContributing to a motion on the recent killings in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, noted that a lot needed to be done to stem the tide of insecurity. He wondered if one report had ever been turned in by the Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know one report that has been turned in by Committee on National Security and Intelligence. I don\u2019t know,\u201d mandating the relevant security committees of the House to step up their oversight functions as well as conclude the reports of their investigations.\n\n\n\nChief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno, frowned on the slow pace with which the Committee on National Security and Intelligence carried out assignments.\n\n\n\nMonguno said, \u201cWith regard to the committee, I can also recall that the first bill that was passed for second reading is my bill, which is the bill on small arms and light weapons. That bill was referred to the national security committee, but up till now, there is no report. Up to the extent that they had to go and appeal to Mr Speaker, which he had to set up an ad hoc committee. That is the extent the committee has not performed.\u201d\n\nPDP: El-Rufai, Amaechi\u2019s Confessions Confirm APC\u2019s Complicity\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said the public utterances by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, confirmed its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts and plans of the terrorists ravaging the nation but deliberately refused to act.\n\nPDP also said the comments by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, that some members of the APC-led Federal Executive Council (FEC) frustrated his request to install security surveillance equipment to avert terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track, confirmed that the APC administration had been creating safety nets for terrorists to freely operate in our country.\n\n\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said in exposing the APC government, which he was a part of, el-Rufai said, \u201cWe know where their camps are, we know where they are, the SSS has their phone numbers, they listen to them and they give me report\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP said that in his own confession, the Minister of Transportation said, \u201cWe knew what the problems would be. We knew we needed to have digital security equipment\u2026I warned that lives will be lost and now lives are lost\u2026 When you come with sincerity to government and your colleagues are stopping you, it is annoying\u201d.\n\n\n\nPDP, therefore, said, \u201cThese revelation from high-ranking APC public officials, who are in the position to know, is troubling as they are unequivocal confirmation that APC leaders are in league with terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not surprising that President Muhammadu Buhari insists on retaining a self-confessed terrorist apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, to continue to head the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, which is indispensable in any meaningful fight against terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\nPolice Defuse Another IED in Kaduna\n\nAnother Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted in Rigasa area of Kaduna was defused by the Nigeria Police yesterday.\n\nThe bomb, the police said, was planted a few kilometres to the Train Station.\n\nOn March 26, 2022, four people were injured in an explosion planted in Danmani community in Rigasa area.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of the state police command, Mohammed Jalige, said the latest IED was planted in the area by yet to be identified persons.\n\nHe said the IED was sighted by residents of the area about 07:50 hours and they promptly reported to the police.\n\n\u201cIn a swift response, the Command\u2019s Explosive Ordinance Department (EOD) swung into action and successful defused the IED, without any loss of lives or property.\n\n\u201cThe acting Commissioner of Police DCP Maiyaki Baba, thanks the residents of the area for their vigilance and prompt reporting of the incidence and assures them that the command will always prioritise the safety of the public,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement advised members of the public to always report suspicious movement or persons in their communities, noting that such information would be treated in full confidentiality.\n\nHe, however, said normalcy had since been restored in the area and residents were going about their normal business.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has debunked reports that motorists were stranded along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, when terrorists barricaded the road.\n\nIn a statement, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the reports were not true.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cA few hours ago, some panic was spread on social media over bandits barricading the Kaduna-Abuja Road and kidnapping citizens plying the route. The buzz in circulation is false and was presented by a group of social media enthusiasts, who celebrate negative news.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary operational feedback showed that fleeing bandits escaping a military onslaught attempted to pass through a narrow corridor around Kasarami general area of Kaduna-Abuja road. The troops, on receiving this intelligence, hurriedly moved to the location and engaged them in the adjoining forest.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said the government would update members of the public whenever more detailed feedback was received.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government does not deny the existence of security challenges and continues to work assiduously with relevant military and security agencies,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nThe market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) gained N3.02 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, notwithstanding the growing insecurity concerns in the country.\n\n\n\nThe market performance was buoyed by impressive corporate earnings by major listed companies that saw some of them delivering robust dividend payout to shareholders.\n\n\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation gained N3.02 trillion to close on March 31, 2022, at N25.312 trillion, higher than the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed companies on the Exchange, also rose by 9.95 per cent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first Q1 2022.\n\nData compiled by THISDAY revealed that the sectoral performance of the NGX was bullish, as most indices closed the period on uptrend as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the NGX Oil & Gas Index appreciated the most by 28.12 per cent. It was closely followed by the NGX Banking Index, which recorded a gain of 8.55 per cent, while the NGX Premium Board Index rose by 6.34 per cent.\n\nOthers were the NGX Pension, NGX Industrial Goods, NGX 30, and NGX Lotus II that went up by 6.34 per cent, 5.63 per cent, 5.39 per cent, 4.37 per cent, and 1.18 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the NGX Insurance and NGX Consumer Goods recorded year-to-date decline of 6.35 per cent and 4.21 per cent respectively, as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nOn a monthly review, the Nigerian bourse witnessed positive price movements leading to a bull-run throughout January 2020, during which it closed with a 9.1 per cent month-on-month growth in the All-Share Index, and extended the gains by 1.7 per cent in February. During the period, BUA Foods got listed, boosting the market capitalisation by N720 billion.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the market performance in Q1 2022, Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said the stock market sustained positive sentiment and uptrend due to the influx of corporate actions and 2021 audited financials, as players reacted to the released numbers and dividend declared for year-end 2021 earnings.\n\n\n\nOmordion said that was expected to support an uptrend during the earnings season, amid the oscillating oil prices, just as the market continues to interpret economic data in relationship with crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis resulted in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks, as 2021 Q4 GDP was up at 3.98 per cent, while the International Monetary Fund called for a hike in the interest rate and further devaluation of the naira,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn the market outlook, Omordion projected mixed sentiment trading by investors in April and beyond, saying all eyes would be on the performance of the economy and how the country\u2019s economic managers would navigate challenges, which included insecurity and activities externally.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, investors would also be concerned about on-going war in Ukraine, energy supply chain distortion that had been one of the major factors driving inflation, insecurity, among other factors that have pushed cost of production, goods and services higher.\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cTo invest profitably in this changing environment, you need investment education, trading plans and trading tools/software. These will help manage risk associated with volatility and unstable markets.\u201d\n\nAn analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye, said investors priced in the dividend payout out by the listed companies, which according to him drove market performance.\n\n\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cInvestors have already priced in the dividend in January and February and that is why the market maintained positive growth during the period. However, there was profit-taking in March as most investors did not bother to wait for the dividend payment date.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that in April, the stock market might witness cautious investors\u2019 trading due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday commended the board and management of the Bank of Industry (BoI) for contributing to the growth and industrialisation of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nBuhari made the commendation when he unveiled the bank\u2019s second edifice in Abuja. He said the structure would boost BoI\u2019s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) potential.\n\n\n\nThat came as BoI said it had raised about $4 billion from over 100 international banks/investors in over 20 countries within the past four years. The bank revealed that it was also working to increase the figure to about $10 billion within the next few years.\n\n\n\nBuhari pointed out that the development finance institution had disbursed over N1.4 trillion to micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) at single-digit interest rate. This helped in making access to credit easier and affordable for Nigerians as well as supporting the diversification agenda.\n\n\n\nBuhari addressed the gathering via a video conferencing. Dignitaries physically present at the unveiling of the BoI edifice included Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Adeniyi Adebayo; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele; Chairman of BoI, Mallam Aliyu AbdulRahman Dikko; and the bank\u2019s Managing Director/Chief Executive, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, as well as development partners.\n\n\n\nThe president expressed optimism that with the raising of a \u20ac700 million Eurobond, the BoI would be able to provide more funding for the growth of businesses in the country.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI am particularly impressed that this world-class building will finance internally generated revenue of the bank. The BoI has continued to successfully execute its mandate as a policy institution of the federal government. Through the Bank of Industry, this government extended the single-digit interest rate loans.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs part of this mandate, the Bank of Industry disbursed over N1.4 trillion to micro, SMEs, and large enterprises, creating over nine million jobs from its inception.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdebayo said BoI had added significant value to the federal government\u2019s industrialisation agenda over the past 62 years and thanked the president and other arms of government for their confidence in the bank.\n\n\n\nBuhari said the DFI had been appointed as the implementation partner for several laudable projects towards alleviating poverty, job creation as well as ensuring affordable financing opportunities for Nigerian enterprises.\n\n\n\nEmefiele, in his remarks, said all the credit must be given to Buhari for setting the pace for the country\u2019s development and economic diversification as well as the restructuring of the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe noted BoI was jointly owned by the CBN and the Federal Ministry of Finance, stressing that the central bank has been working closely with the DFI to ensure that it achieves its mandate.\n\n\n\nThe CBN governor said, \u201cSince 2014 when I assumed leadership at the CBN, we have ensured that we work closely with BoI to ensure that their core mandate, which is to provide finance for the development of not just the Small and Medium Enterprises but also our large corporate.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat they are able to complement our efforts in achieving the vision that has been set by President Muhammadu Buhari that says that we should work together to make sure we make finance available to Nigerians and not just make finance available to Nigerians but also make this finance available at affordable interest rates.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cI will continue to give the credit to the president for setting the vision for the development and diversification of the Nigerian economy. Not just development and diversification but also ensuring that we really work hard to restructure the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom being an import-dependent economy to an economy that is self-sufficient and economy that develops itself and ensures that we reduce imports and begin to export and produce.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmefiele said Nigeria has the potential to grow not just its economy but also the economy of other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n\nThe BoI managing director disclosed that the bank had raised about $4 billion from over 100 international banks/investors in over 20 countries within the past four years, adding that most of the funds ended up as part of the country\u2019s foreign reserve.\n\n\n\nWhile thanking Buhari for the renewal of his tenure and that of the chairman for another five years, Pitan assured that the board would work harder and, \u201ccomplete our succession planning project, which is on-going with our consultants, Price Waterhouse.\u201d\n\n\n\nPitan said through the president\u2019s support, BoI had been able to approach the international capital market and conclude various funding transactions, including a $750 million syndicated medium-term loan in 2018, which had now been fully paid; \u20ac1billion syndicated loan in March 2020; $1billion syndicated loan in December 2020; and recently the \u20ac750million Senior Eurobond (the first by any African national DFI) in February 2022, whose sovereign guarantee was also approved by the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nThe BoI MD added that these funds had significantly improved the bank\u2019s capacity to continually support Nigeria\u2019s real sector.\n\nOn his part, Dikko said the commissioning was an important milestone for the bank, as it signifies the culmination of many years of tenacity and determination to ensure that the edifice was completed and put to judicious use.\n\nHe said judging by the increasing profile of the bank and its operations, the new building should open new business frontiers for the country in general.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, for decades, BoI has delivered appreciable results on its mandate towards transforming the country\u2019s industrial sector by providing affordable and long-term financing across key segments and sectors of the economy.\n\n\n\nThe BoI chairman said in the last five years alone, working with strategic partners, the bank had supported over 3.2 million MSMEs as well as large enterprises, and created over 7.1 million direct and indirect jobs in the process.\n\nHe added that the bank\u2019s total assets also grew from N683 billion in 2016 to N1.7 trillion in 2021.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cBOI has consistently aligned its corporate strategy with the strategic objectives of the federal government, especially as it relates to industrialisation and job creation; from Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan, to Economic Recovery and Growth Plan; and now to the newly introduced National Development Plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo that end, the bank has been a reliable partner in managing several intervention projects and funds targeted towards entrepreneurship, economic rehabilitation and poverty eradication on behalf of the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe BoI Tower 2 is a state-of-the-art innovative building with 12 lettable floors with unique features, which include energy-conserving smart lighting system that is motion activated, back-up power system with special panels that are synchronised to deliver power according to demand and high diesel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe facility is also built with a building management system, which monitors, supervises, controls and reports on smart building technology systems, including generators, CCTVs, and other gadgets.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Telcos under the aegis of the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) say they are considering an upward review of tariffs.\n\nAccording to the telcos, the development is due to the rising cost of diesel and its implications for the cost of doing business.\n\nThey also said the security situation in the country has made it unsafe to send out service personnel to some parts of the country, thereby hampering their operations.\n\nSpeaking with TheCable on Thursday night, Gbenga Adebayo, ALTON chairman, called for government intervention in the telecommunications sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said unless there is an intervention, operators will have no choice but to begin a process of price review.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to provide services but we are concerned about the high costs. Without government intervention, we may consider increasing tariffs to reflect current realities,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just wake up and increase prices. There are regulatory procedures that we need to follow to review prices.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Ire Aderinokun is helping to shape Helicarrier's culture",
          "text": "The search for remote work has increased by 490% since the beginning of the pandemic. This means more companies, including big tech ones, have had to move their operations online.\n\nRemote work comes with its own advantages including a reduction in overhead costs with this Stanford report stating that companies can save between $2,000 to $11,000 per employee when they switch to remote work.\n\nIt also expands a company\u2019s reach and allows them to employ global talent, as well as expand to other regions and markets. In 2021, there were a number of product/market expansions on the continent that were fueled by raises and eased by remote work options. This includes Zuri Health\u2019s expansion into Senegal, MarketForce\u2019s entry into Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia, and even Mono\u2019s expansion into Ghana.\n\nRemote work, however, comes with its own disadvantages including decreased work/life balance, decreased employee visibility, a lack of team synergy, all of which can lead to harmful or stoic work culture.\n\nSo, how can founders, managers, and team leads build remote teams with healthy and sustainable cultures? How can companies manage distributed teams during their growth phase?\n\nIre Aderinokun, COO and VP, Engineering, at Helicarrier has a few answers. In the eighth episode of TechCabal\u2019s Building From Ground Up, Aderinokun speaks to TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye and shares how she\u2019s helping Helicarrier manage its remote team.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Timi Ajiboye, Tomiwa Lasebikan and Ire Aderinokun, Helicarrier was originally Bitkoin Africa, a website for peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading. Upon getting into Y Combinator in 2018, Bitkoin Africa morphed into BuyCoins with a number of product offerings including crypto trading. Last year, the trio created Helicarrier as the parent company to house all its products including BuyCoins, Sendcash, Sendcash Pay, and more.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, Ire Aderinokun, and Timi Ajiboye at Y Combinator in 2018\n\nWhile the team started with just 5 members, it quickly grew to 10 in its first year. Now, 5 years after launch, Helicarrier boasts of over 50 employees across 4 countries, all of whom are fully remote. So how does Aderinokun, whose office handles operations and staffing, manage her distributed team?\n\nUsing tools to build trust\n\nFor Aderinokun who studied psychology but ended up a software engineer, one of the most important ways Helicarrier has managed its remote team is by using no-code tools everyone can easily learn.\n\n\u201cWe rely a lot on the tools we use. Basecamp is our primary project management tool, and it allows us to keep track of what everyone is doing. But it also allows us to build trust,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nHelicarrier operates an asynchronous work structure. A synchronous work mode means that everyone is working simultaneously, and tasks or comments are responded to in real-time and without delay. It\u2019s the method employed by most companies globally. An asynchronous work structure, on the other hand, does not require all hands to work at the same time. This structure allows employees to maximise productivity by working when it best suits them, within reason of course.\n\n\u201cHaving an asynchronous work structure only really works when you have trust in the team, and enabling our team with tools has helped us do just that.\u201d\n\nFor a distributed remote team like Helicarrier\u2019s, asynchronous work also helps to address the difference in time zones. While most of Aderinokun\u2019s team is based in Lagos, Nigeria, a few are based in Ghana, Kenya, and even the UK.\n\n\u201cWe do have a working day, 10 AM to 5 PM and any team meetings we have are usually within this period. But we\u2019re not particular about when people get things done. If someone wants to do 4 hours of work in the middle of the night, that\u2019s fine with us. As long as you\u2019re achieving the set goals, you can work on your own time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aderinokun, Helicarrier also tries to be sensitive toward its employees\u2019 needs. The company pays its employees dollar stable coins and also pays for daily lunches and internet subscriptions.\n\n\u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto.\u201d\n\nSmall teams mean tighter bonds\n\nPaying salaries in crypto is not the only unconventional thing Helicarrier does.\n\nUpon hiring new team members, the company offers a one-month paid trial period that helps both employer and employee see if there\u2019s a culture fit. \u201cWith this method, they can see how we work and stay if they\u2019re comfortable. We\u2019ll also get to measure their skills up,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nOn building and maintaining company culture, Aderinokun states that most of the team members have direct relationships with 2 of the 3 co-founders.\n\n\u201cEven as we grow, one of the ways we install the company culture is by building direct relationships. So, everyone on the team works directly under one of the 3 co-founders. But we\u2019ve created a system where all team members can have a relationship with another co-founder they don\u2019t work under.\u201d\n\nBecause Helicarrier is still a small team of 50, its solution is feasible. As more team members get hired, though, Aderinokun believes that the team will have to find a sustainable method.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Andela expands its tech talent pool beyond software engineers",
          "text": "To date, Andela has helped companies build their remote engineering teams by giving them access to vetted software engineers from over 100 countries, counting among its clientele leading companies like GitHub, Goldman Sachs, and Cloudflare.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the global talent company said it is expanding its offering beyond engineering talent to include matching in new practice areas: specifically design, data, and product management.\n\n\u201cHaving worked across the continent and beyond, we know that the tech ecosystem does not just need only engineering talent,\u201d Agnes Muthoni, Director of the Andela Learning Community, said on the move. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that software engineers work entirely independently. It takes a variety of skill sets and expertise to make technical solutions that work.\u201d\n\nThe onboarding process for the new set of technical talent will be similar to Andela\u2019s existing model, consisting of English language and soft-skills assessments, technical assessments, and a portfolio review. But within the latter two, there will be some variance.\n\n\u201cWhere a software engineer will typically complete a coding challenge and peer code review, a designer may complete a project or do a portfolio walk-through and critique,\u201d Muthoni told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe expansion of Andela\u2019s offering coincides with the launch of its new platform for talent matching, which the company says is designed to create a \u201cmore direct and personalised hiring experience\u201d for both talent and recruiters.\n\nTill now, Andela has employed a hands-on matching process to help clients scale their technical team, which involves sifting through resumes and screening calls, and typically takes several weeks to complete.\n\nCompanies now have the option of using the self-service platform which, according to Andela, cuts down the hiring lifecycle for hiring managers and recruiters to as little as 48 hours.\n\n\u201cThe need to build scalable teams that can grow together when miles apart is increasingly apparent. Using the platform, hiring managers can find and hire their ideal candidate in two days or in less than two weeks, 70% faster than traditional in-house recruitment,\u201d Muthoni said.\n\nAndela\u2019s new website.\n\nHiring managers simply have to create a company profile, post a job, and can see curated and vetted candidates instantly. Talents can also see how well their skills match up to roles, with both parties having access to visualise compatibility, including overlap in skills and preferences.\n\n\u201cEach assessment and onboarding path gives a better indication of the kinds of teams they will be successful in,\u201d Muthoni said. \u201cTechnologists only need to test once instead of for each client or role, allowing hiring managers to focus on team fit instead of skills reviews. It simplifies the time commitment on both sides and increases the likelihood of a successful match.\u201d\n\nAccording to Andela, the matching accounts for depth and breadth of skill requirements, timezone and working hour overlaps, industry expertise, and team fit. In addition, the platform uses data-driven technology and algorithms to make smart match recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe Andela platform is constantly learning, helping to refine its personalised recommendations. As users accept or reject recommendations, they are also asked for specific feedback. With each bit of feedback, the platform becomes more personalised,\u201d the company explained in an official statement.\n\nWhen it comes to platforms, personalisation has become a \u201cbasic expectation\u201d, notes Jeremy Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Andela.\n\n\u201cAmazon, Apple, and Netflix have changed every aspect of our lives\u2014from how we shop to how we consume culture and everything in between. This is why we\u2019ve built our new platform\u2014to help talent find jobs that match their technical skills and careers that match their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether Andela plans to phase out its initial model permanently, Muthoni noted that there will always be a need for a hands-on human-first matching process with the self-service platform launched only to give clients an option that helps them move through the recruitment cycle quickly.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is Andela\u2019s clients can now choose their preferred service \u2013 the existing white-glove hands-on supported approach or rapid self-service through their new platform.\u201d\n\nAlongside its expanded offerings and new platform, Andela has also unveiled a new brand identity meant to \u201cbetter reflect the evolution of both the company as well as the global talent industry that it has helped to spawn.\u201d\n\nThese announcements come 6 months after Andela closed a $200 million Series E. The round\u2014led by Softbank Vision Fund 2, the venture capital arm of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank\u2014valued the company at $1.5 billion, cementing its place as one of Africa\u2019s unicorn startups.\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an African-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. Notorious for being harder to get into than Harvard, Andela grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and developer training methodology.\n\nThrough its Andela Learning Community, it claims to have provided training and career opportunities for over 175,000 engineers globally at different stages of their careers.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor African football fans, the weekend is not just a time to take a break from the hustle; it is also time for battle. They watch TV screens intently, fuming, cheering, and cajoling as their teams in the various European leagues battle on the pitch.\n\nHowever, some fans now look forward to the footballing weekend for more than just the love of their teams. The love for the game is now shared with the passion for fantasy football or football betting.\n\nFantasy sports in Africa isn\u2019t much of a thing. Sports betting, however, is quite popular. In a survey conducted by GeoPoll in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, 72% of respondents had participated in betting, 53% of which was football betting.\n\nWhile fantasy sports in Africa might be a fantasy (pun intended), compared to sports betting, it is big in other regions. And though they might appear similar because they involve gambling, they are done differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of betting on real-life football teams, fantasy football involves gambling on virtual teams created by the player-manager. The teams created will include virtual forms of real-life footballers.\n\nThe virtual team manager earns points in the game based on the actual performances of their players.\n\nIn the English Premier League\u2019s Fantasy Football League (FPL), the managers get \u00a3100 million ($130.8 million) to buy 15 players from different clubs. They are only allowed to buy three players from a single club. As in real-life, players differ in price based on their performances.\n\nSome other European leagues have a fantasy version of their leagues, with the Fantasy Liga and Fantasy Bundesliga owned by the Spanish and German leagues, respectively.\n\nAccording to football magazine FourFourTwo, FPL has eight million players globally who compete to be the Jose Mourinho of fantasy football.\n\n$3 million to make fantasy football mainstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eksab team. Source: Supplied\n\nOn Monday, March 28, 2022, Eksab, an Egyptian fantasy football startup, announced that it had raised $3 million from investors to scale its platform. The round was led by 4DX Ventures, with participation from Golden Palm Investments, Darwazah Capital, P1 Ventures, and angel investors.\n\nFounded in 2018, the startup\u2019s first offering is a prediction game where users create a fantasy lineup with a leaderboard showing their progress. Users who predict correctly are eligible for prizes.\n\nWith over 700,000 users on its platform, the startup reports that its paying users have increased 60% month on month. Although the startup\u2019s current focus is on football, it plans to get into other sports soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving betting companies a run for their money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the world, startups are capitalising on the almost religious following that sports enjoys with fantasy football offerings. Investors are also not holding back, as seen in French startup, Sorare\u2019s $680 million Series B round.\n\nIn Africa, though, betting companies are capitalising on the following that sports, particularly football, enjoys on the continent. According to Business Day, Africa\u2019s most populous country, Nigeria, spends \u20a62 billion ($4.9 million) on sports betting daily.\n\nIntervals between games are frequently littered with ads from betting companies. And some of the biggest platforms have signed up former players as ambassadors in Nigeria. However, Eksab\u2019s raise could be the beginning of fierce competition between sports betting companies and fantasy football platforms.\n\nA few factors have contributed to fantasy sports\u2019 growth. The first is that players compete against each other rather than against the bookie. Consequently, a player\u2019s result largely depends on their skill level. On the face of it, this looks positive, but it also means that unskilled players do not stand a chance against top players.\n\nThe second is the low entry barrier. Most fantasy sports sites do not require players to pay before playing. On the other hand, users need money to participate in sports betting. As a result, more people can easily join fantasy sports platforms.\n\nWhile fantasy sports seems like an evenly matched competitor for sports betting platforms, the market share of betting companies could see them add fantasy sports to their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIt\u2019s Friday, a new month, and I hope you\u2019ve had a productive and satisfying week. This week has been a mixed one for Nigerians, especially for residents of Kaduna. First, terrorists attacked the state\u2019s lone airport; then, a train carrying over 900 passengers was attacked, with some passengers killed or kidnapped.\n\nThe Super Eagles, Nigeria\u2019s men\u2019s team, drew a World Cup qualifying game in the same week, ensuring that the country will be absent when football\u2019s biggest tournament kicks off in November.\n\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t all sad. 18 of the 24 countries that made up Y Combinator\u2019s W22 batch are based in Nigeria, proving that investors and founders see massive potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were appearances from countries like Sudan, Namibia, and Uganda, and we discussed all that on the Techpoint Africa podcast. You can listen using your preferred podcast providers.\n\nToday\u2019s Techpoint Digest discusses waste management in Africa, Tushop\u2019s pre-seed, Khazna\u2019s Series A, and Techpoint Pitch Friday. We also have a roundup of opportunities in African tech.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nManaging waste with tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, while on a work break, I went to get some food with Ogheneruemu. Like many eateries in Nigeria, our food was packed in plastic plates. After eating, she remarked, \u201cthese guys need a recycling plan ASAP.\u201d\n\nWaste landfills are a common sight in many African countries, but you would also find waste dumped into gutters and canals. About 2.1 billion tonnes of waste is produced each year globally, with reports stating Africa had about 125 million tonnes in 2012 and is expected to grow to 244 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nShe spoke to Damilola Kadiri, Founder of Wura, and Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO\u2019s Founder, about their experiences building businesses that tackle waste management in Africa using tech.\n\nMeet two Nigerian companies using technology to change how we reuse waste\n\nGrocery shopping with the community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is one of the most common explanations for human motivation. At the lowest level are physiological needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood is probably the most critical physiological need in Africa, and not just because we need it to stay alive. Its importance can be seen during elections when politicians frequently share food during campaigns.\n\nAs food costs rise worldwide, Africa is one of the hardest-hit regions with high food inflation, meaning that its residents spend as much as 40% of their income on food alone. That figure is 56.65% in Nigeria, while Kenyans spend 36% of their income on food.\n\nWhile the best way to mitigate these problems would be to produce and preserve more food, that requires significant investments. However, Kenyan startup, Tushop, uses community group buying to help Kenyans save on food.\n\nHow does community group buying work? Someone \u2014 usually called a community leader \u2014 aggregates orders from individuals who live close to each other. It is then relayed to the vendor, farmer, or distributor, after which it is delivered to the community leader. This community leader then unpacks the orders and delivers them to those who made them.\n\nMost Africans are familiar with this, and some offices in Nigeria even operate a similar model where they buy groceries for the Christmas holidays. Now, Tushop wants to use technology to make this available to more people and has announced a $3 million pre-seed round.\n\nAided by the coronavirus pandemic, group buying has grown in popularity in China and India. In this round, Tushop has received backing from 4DX Ventures, JAM Fund, Breyer Capital, Chandaria Capital, TO Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, FirstCheck Africa, DFS Lab, Wasoko. Other investors include Raja Kaul, President Sundial Group; Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO; Eli Pollak, Apollo Agriculture CEO; and Ida Mannoh, Director of Growth, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds raised to grow its team, improve its tech while expanding across Nairobi with its sights set on expanding to other Kenyan cities. Last week on the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we spoke about white founders in Kenya, so it\u2019s interesting to see a black female founder from Kenya today.\n\nKhazna\u2019s plans for financial inclusion in Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve come across an African fintech startup, I would have enough to take three months off and watch my favourite football team play. I promise I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m not.\n\nSo who\u2019s in the news today? Khazna, an Egyptian super app. The Cairo-based startup has announced a $38 million Series A split between debt and equity.\n\nSome of the investors involved in this round include Speedinvest, Algebra Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, Disruptech, Khawarizmi Ventures, and Nclude \u2014 the VC fund launched by some Egyptian banks. By the way, I\u2019ve observed that many African startups are increasingly favouring debt financing.\n\nWhat does Khazna do? Putting Khazna in a box might be difficult. While the startup offers financial services, it also has other non-financial services.\n\nHowever, the startup launched with Khazna HR, a salary-on-demand service that enables partner employers to offer partial discounts to their employees before payday.\n\nThe startup is not the only one playing in that field, with Earnipay and Cadana as some of its competitors in the African market. While these startups offer it as a standalone service, it is just one of several services that Khazna offers.\n\nThe startup also offers a buy now, pay later service, available in 1,000 merchant stores in Egypt. With 150,000 users, the startup is dreaming big and plans to increase that number to 1 million by the end of 2022.\n\nApril\u2019s Techpoint Pitch Friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.\n\nThe quote above attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson suggests that the man with a better product will always have the most customers.\n\nHowever, with numerous (identical) brands competing for our attention, it\u2019s not enough to have a good product. It would help if you told your story clearly and compellingly.\n\nNot everyone loves to speak before a crowd or even knows how to do it right, but you can get better with practice and feedback.\n\nAt Techpoint Pitch Friday, entrepreneurs not only get to pitch their startups before an enthusiastic crowd but get feedback that helps with product development or refining their pitch.\n\nIn March\u2019s edition, Dayo Oyekanmi and Oluwafemi Adeleke pitched Harmony and Siara, respectively, and it could be your turn this month.\n\nREGISTER for a chance to pitch your startup or be a part of the audience on Friday, April 8, 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first talked to Damilola Kadiri, Wura Founder, early this year, my first thought was, \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\nWura is an item-sharing mobile app that enables you to give and receive used items from people either close to or far from you in Nigeria. These items could be clothes, books, shoes, jewellery, headphones, etc. Anything that is still useful and has value can be given out on the app.\n\nEarly last week, very late on Tuesday night, I talked to Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO Founder, after several scheduling mishaps.\n\nUsing a community-based model, GIVO uses technology to collect recyclable material from individuals, families, and businesses, which it turns into valuable goods. In 2020, the company produced personal protective equipment (PPE) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, although this is only one aspect of what the company does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, why did I talk to these two founders?\n\nThe global problem\n\nFor many people travelling by road into Lagos State, Nigeria, the first sight that greets them is the massive waste landfill at Ojota. The site has become quite iconic, and not in a good way; it stinks to high heaven and probably constitutes some sort of biohazard.\n\nIt serves as one of the dumping grounds for all waste trucks in the state. However, despite the government\u2019s best efforts, Lagos still has a waste problem, as evidenced by the informal dumping grounds \u2014 also known as gutters and canals \u2014 that constitute the waste disposal mechanism for many residents.\n\nBut this is not just a Lagos or a Nigerian problem. It is not even an African problem. It is way bigger; it is a global issue.\n\nEvery year, the earth\u2019s inhabitants produce 2.1 billion tonnes of waste, only 16% of which is recycled. On a positive note, 700 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions are prevented from entering the atmosphere.\n\nBut, one little \u2014 more like humongous \u2014 challenge exists: the world\u2019s population keeps growing at an alarming rate. Africa is expected to reach nearly 2.5 billion people by 2050. At the moment, the continent is reportedly home to 1.3 billion people.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: as the population grows, waste grows, and global waste is expected to grow by 70% by 2050.\n\nEssentially, a 16% recycling rate doesn\u2019t begin to cut it; there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWura\u2019s value proposition\n\nKadiri launched Wura \u2014 meaning gold in the Yoruba language \u2014 in November 2021. Available on Google Play Store and the Apple App store, it enables users to give and receive used items for free. Wura is a product of Kadiri\u2019s increasing interest in sustainability and saving the environment, but also his need to help people by changing their behaviour towards the planet.\n\nSince launch, the app has seen 354 users sign up and 47 items given out.\n\nThe cycle of giving and receiving involves signing up as a user on the platform. So, while a person can view all the different items available on the app, they won\u2019t be able to give or receive anything without signing up and creating an account.\n\nOne interesting bit about the app is that a person looking to receive does not pay any money for the item. There is a set of Golden Rules to prevent anything untoward from happening. Users are urged to only receive items from people with a profile picture and report a giver who insists on collecting money from them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is to prevent people from throwing out perfectly good items with good reusable value, thereby reducing generated waste. There are also plans to introduce the option of giving away food, but cultural issues surrounding receiving food from strangers stand as a barrier to that.\n\nThe app also shows you how your actions affect the environment whenever you give or receive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Kadiri told me, there are no plans to commercialise the app for the next three to four years. A surprising decision if you ask me, but he has his reasons.\n\n\u201cFor now, we are looking at increasing the number of transactions on the app and sign-ups, then over time, what we intend to do is promote sustainability businesses. So I feel that would be an avenue for us to generate profit. As I said, the idea is to change people\u2019s behaviour to be eco-friendly.\n\n\u201cAnyone who comes around the app most likely has that attitude already. With that now, we know that the adverts or the promos on our platform are strictly eco-friendly products.\u201d\n\nEssentially, as people use Wura and begin to see how their actions help protect the planet by reducing CO2 emissions when they don\u2019t just throw things away, their attitudes should change.\n\nChanging attitudes lead to more interest in protecting the environment and, in turn, more interest in businesses that promote sustainability.\n\nAmbitious? Definitely. Doable? Maybe. It would be interesting to see how this works eventually.\n\nGIVO\u2019s circular economy\n\nGIVO or Garbage In, Value Out was birthed from Victor Boyle-Komolafe and the Capture Solution\u2019s team\u2019s participation in the Entrepreneurs Plastics Innovation Challenge (EPIC) sponsored by Coca-Cola and the HYBR Group in 2018.\n\nEPIC is an innovation challenge aimed at identifying solutions to eliminate plastic waste in Nigeria by sourcing sustainable solutions to identify, develop, and scale potential circular innovations from entrepreneurs, wherever they may be.\n\nBoyle-Komolafe describes GIVO as a technology company and not particularly a recycling company.\n\n\u201cWe came into this space as techies. We want to save the environment, but we also want to scale.\u201d\n\nNothing typifies the company\u2019s decision more than its partnership with the University of Warwick, UK, De Montfort University, and Chatham House as they research the best way to scale sustainability businesses.\n\nWhat does GIVO do?\n\nAs a business, GIVO has two main value propositions: manufacturer and collector. As a manufacturer, the company makes plastic sheets from recyclables that they can then sell to people in the construction and furniture industry. But, Boyle-Komolafe believes it is not as scalable as other aspects of the business.\n\nAs a collector, GIVO establishes women/youth-led community centres that collect waste within a 2-3 kilometre radius; a deliberate decision, he explains.\n\n\u201cIn a 2-kilometre radius, there will always be recyclables. So you know that you have a consistent market share.\u201d\n\nFrom collection to sorting to shredding, the entire process is digitised using the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile apps, and 2D scanners. Currently, there are two GIVO centres in Nigeria, with plans to launch three more before the end of the first quarter of 2022. According to Boyle-Komolafe, each centre collects 90 tonnes a year. There are also plans to franchise the centres next year, with GIVO collecting a percentage of the revenue.\n\nBut he also mentions that collection is incentive-driven.\n\nFrom the GIVO centres, the company also collates a lot of data which it can then sell as aggregate data to the government or companies for several uses.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government has limited resources, and you\u2019re trying to plan for the next cancer centre or a liver care centre. All that needs to be done is to go through our database and see the GIVO centre collecting the most alcoholic drink or receiving the most alcoholic drinks with no bar or a restaurant as a major client.\u201d\n\nData like that would provide information about where there might be an outbreak of liver-related diseases and inform government decisions. He also says companies can use it to determine the success of advertising campaigns in specific areas.\n\nCelebrating recycling heroes\n\nBoth Kadiri and Boyle-Komolafe see the recycling game as a long-term business. It requires careful planning and execution to ensure the initial goal of sustainability is not lost.\n\nThe process starts with educating people and, in GIVO\u2019s case, incentivising them to understand the circular economy of buy-reuse/recycle-buy.\n\nThe work ahead is still very tedious and long but also rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state governor, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, on Thursday announced the upgrade of the state College of Education, Ilesa, to a full-fledged university.\n\nHe said the decision was arrived on after painstakingly and carefully examining the request made by prominent sons and daughters of Ijesaland to that effect.\n\n\u201cLet me say that, having looked into and examined carefully the request made by prominent sons and daughters of Ijesa Land, and the Owa, our highly-revered Royal Father, His Imperial Majesty, Owa Obokun Adimula of Ijesaland, Oba (Dr.) Gabriel Aromolaran, Government has decided to upgrade the Osun College of Education, Ilesa, to a full-fledged University,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have also engaged one of the nation\u2019s best corporate Consultants, KPMG, to work out the sustainability plan of the upgrade\u201d, he said.\n\nThis is even as the Governor inaugurated the Ijesa community funded Geriatric Centre.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated Geriatric Centre was funded and built by prominent Ijasa sons and daughters.\n\nInaugurating the Centre, which is a product of the magnanimity of the Ijesa people through the Ijesa Health is Wealth Project, Governor Oyetola noted that the initiative was another testament to the generosity and abiding passion of the great Ijesa people to add value to the lives of the people.\n\nHe said the gesture would go a long way to complement his administration\u2019s sustained investment in the health sector as government has devoted unprecedented attention to revitalizing the health sector in the last three years.\n\nAccording to him, the concerted development has given birth to the revitalisation of 332 primary health centres across all the wards in the state, improved welfare of medical workers, construction of a 120-bed ward, construction of 30 units of doctors\u2019 quarters at the State Specialist Hospital, Asubiaro, Osogbo, among others.\n\nOyetola, who noted that his Administration has successfully put Osun on the world map of quality healthcare provision, said, \u201cThis is an intervention that other well-meaning indigenous groups should emulate and be counted to become frontline contributors to the development of our State\u201d\n\nGovernor Oyetola expressed gratitude to the sons and daughters of Ijesaland for their unflinching support in general and for contributing significantly to the development of the State.\n\nHe said the newly- inaugurated health facility would further help to bring quality healthcare service delivery to the people.\n\n\u201cConsidering our nation\u2019s growing aged population and the absence of the requisite medical care for our senior citizens, this project is certainly excellently well-thought-out and has definitely come to fill a much-needed void.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Ijesa Geriatric Centre is a welcome development as it brings closer to our people a specialised geriatric care. This is against the background of the truism that being old is not a disease and that senior citizens have a right to medical care as indeed the younger population.\n\n\u201cRealising their invaluable role in the development of the society, our senior citizens should deservedly be treated with warmth, utmost respect and be provided a truly-enabling environment where they can interact with healthcare professionals with dignity.\n\n\u201cDoing so is instructive, as it shows that our senior citizens are valued for their contributions to the development of our society. This is the need that this Geriatric Center has come to fill, and we cannot thank you enough for making it possible, only ten months after its construction was commenced.\n\n\u201cWorth a billion Naira, this Centre is an expansive facility that comprises the general outpatient building, administrative building, ophthalmology and dental building, physiotherapy, theatre complex, inward among other essential facilities that will provide the best of medical care for our senior citizens.\n\n\u201cI consider this project absolutely complementary to our administration\u2019s sustained investment in the health sector. You will recall that in the last three years plus of our administration, we have devoted unprecedented attention to revitalizing our health sector\u201d, he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran, thanked all illustrious and eminent Ijesa people both home and in the diaspora for the initiative, support, commitment and the degree of responsiveness to the developmental agenda of Ijesaland.\n\nAccording to the reverred monarch, the project has once again attested to the commitment of Ijesa people to igniting the contagious relentless efforts towards breaking the paradigm for community development.\n\nOba Aromolaran, who commended Governor Oyetola for his tremendous achievements in the various sectors of the economy, said it was a thing of joy that the new health facility was constructed to complement his monumental strides in the health sector.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy to openly declare that the primary concern of the entire Ijesa people through the Ijesa Community Development Assembly is the smooth, efficient, effective and prudent management of the Ijesaland Geriatric Centre and where necessary the people of Ijesa would always provide complementary support for the sustainability of effective service delivery to the elderly people\u201d, the monarch added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Asiwaju of Ijesaland, Olayinka Fasuyi, expressed gratitude to the the sons and daughters of Ijesaland for the successful actualisation of the project.\n\nHe attributed the success of the project to the timely support and donations from the people of Ijesaland saying, \u201cthe meeting we held yielded bountiful results as we were able to put in a number of strategies to finally arrive at a total cost of the project.\n\n\u201cStrategizing and Mobilising funds for the project implementation have been the most harrowing challenge imaginable. Indeed, it is better imagined than experienced.\n\n\u201cIt is important to salute the unparalleled commitment and dexterity of the Ijesa to their community development as generously demonstrated in these last two projects black-to-back.\n\n\u201cToday, Ijesaland has successfully built and delivered the second geriatric centre in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate you for heeding our age-old prayers of upgrading the 44-year-old College of Education, Ilesa, to a full fledged University.\n\n\u201cMr. Governor, You have honoured us, God will continue to honour you. You have listened to our requests and our overdue agitations. God will not forsake you. You have rekindled our hope as Ijesa people and you have made us proud with this declaration. You shall continue to be celebrated. I want to assure you that Ijesaland shall vote massively beyond your imagination in return of your kind gesture to us. It is only God in His infinity that will compensate you, \u201c he noted.",

          "title": "NURTW stakeholders, TOOAN call for calm, say loyalty to Tinubu, Sanwo-Olu not negotiable",
          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nThe leadership of the Tricycles Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria (TOOAN) and principal officers of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), in a press conference, Thursday, said the Union and all its affiliates, under Lagos State chapter, are fiercely loyal to the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu presidential bid and the re-election of Governor Babajide Sanwoolu as Lagos State Governor.\n\nThe leaders who gathered to offer their solidarity for Asiwaju for 2023 include, Alhaji Rafiu Akanni Olohunwa, former Chairman NURTW, Lagos Council, Comrd. Seyi Bankole, Secretary NURTW, Lagos State , Alh. Muritala Lawal(Epo) former Chairman TOOAN Lagos Council, BOT TOOAN other top NURTW leaders, all promising to mobilise their grassroot support base for the realisation of the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in 2023 General Election and that of Governor Babajide Sanwoolu\u2019s second term bid come 2023\n\nThey also restated their commitment to the continued existence of the NURTW in Lagos state, insisting that they are never part of any body or group calling for the dissolution of NURTW in the state.\n\nThe leaders used the occasion to offer their support for Chairmanship of Alh. Abiola Azeez, Istijabah as the TOOAN Lagos State Chairman.\n\nAccording to them, Asiwaju Tinubu more than any other candidate deserves the support of Nigerians because of his sterling contribution to national development, his modernisation policies while he was Lagos State Governor;and his perspicacity and nose for picking his successors in the state.\n\nSpeaking to all the members of the association across Lagos state, Alh. Abiola Azeez, Istijabah, Lagos State Chairman TOOAN, stated that the association under his administration has pledged total support to the administration of Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State, adding that the tricycles association would back his second term bid , declaring that their support for Tinubu, Sanwoolu was not negotiable.\n\nHe further reiterated that the association was doing well in the state, saying \u201cWe are doing a Union job and we will continue to do the union job.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know about the value of the union then you are not part of us . Nobody can drive us away from the job.\n\nAlhaji Istijabah assured members to be calm, saying that the current crisis would soon be resolved, while pledging his loyalty to Alhaji Ibikunle Baruwa, National President of the National Union of Road Transport Association of Nigeria.\n\nHe said that those behind the contrived crisis in the state are not God , adding that those who God can not arrest, He has not created. Nobody can take away our job. He urged everyone to be calm. He said some people have decided to pull out of the union, \u201chaving eaten too much, and are not ready to abide by the regulation of the national body; but on our own at TOOAN, we are still with the national body.\n\nIstijabah while stating reasons why TOOAN and NURTW are offering support for the reelection of Sanwoolu in Lagos State disclosed that the administration\u2019s commitment to road rehabilitation and construction, improved welfare of the people in the state, containment of the Covid-19 in Lagos state as well as the recent release of over 500 mini buses and 1000 new GAC cars to ensure efficient intra-city transportation and employment creations in the state , are some of the reasons why he should be considered for reelection in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cSanwoolu has done well, his administration is a good one, he has done well in road construction. I heard recently that some unions said they will not support Sanwoolu\u2019s second term, but TOOAN and NURTW are ready to support him. He has done well.\n\nLagos Alhaji Rafiu Olorunwa also at the press briefing called for calm, while tracing the genesis of the crisis to Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya\u2019s unwillingness to abide by the arbitration of the national headquarters of the NURTW, and instead declared that he had pulled out Lagos chapter from the national body.\n\nComrade Bankole Oluwaseni, the state secretary of NURTW further shed light on the position of Olorunwa, he stated that the whole issue was between Alhaji Akinsanya and the Board of Trustees of TOOAN.\n\nAccording to him, Akinsanya was imposing his own people who were not members of the tricycles association on TOOAN, while the authentic members and founding members were shut out of the affairs.\n\nIt was the intervention of the national headquarters that weighed in, according to the Lagos State NURTW Secretary , the directive from Baruwa ordered Akinsanya to allow Alhaji Istijabah to run the Lagos chapter of TOOAN, but Akinsanya refused, an action that informed his suspension by the national headquarters.\n\nMany who spoke at the press conference said the appointment of the new state chairman of TOAN was the problem. Oluomo, they said was not ready to countenance Alhaji Istijabah and series of meetings convened by Baruwa -led national body to iron out the differences failed as a result of the alleged intransigence of Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya, MC Oluomo.\n\n\u201dBefore the administration of Akinsanya, it was learnt that the Board of Trustees of TOOAN normally nominated their chairman. He said, \u201cWe have the state chairman of NURTW, and also there\u2019s the state chairman of TOOAN.\n\n\u201cIt is the Board of Trustees of TOOAN that was always in charge of the nomination of chairman, and not even the headquarters. It was when Akinsanya was imposing his will on us that we decided to petition the national headquarters\u201d, Oluwaseyi said.\n\nOn his part, Comrade Muritala Lawal, Epo, former Lagos State Chairman of TOOAN, said that, as the pioneer Chairman of TOOAN in Lagos state, the leadership of the association as an affiliate of NURTW stands with authentic leadership of the NURTW in Lagos state.\n\nHe noted that the Association is never in support of anyone or group who would want to destroy the success of the association since it was created. He further said that since such a person had been suspended there is no need for the state government to continue to take him seriously.\n\nHe said TOOAN joined NURTW after a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the NURTW. He noted that this coordination was prompted by the policy of the government to encourage cohesion among road transport unions in the state.",

          "text": "Seeking a consensus PDP presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections, four northern aspirants, Aminu Tambuwal, Bala Mohammed, Bukola Saraki and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, visited former military President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) to seek his support.\n\nApart from Hayatu-Deen, the others had individually visited IBB in the past to seek his endorsement. Almost everyone who aspires to be president has visited IBB for political patronage.\n\nOut of the 14 PDP presidential aspirants that have picked nomination forms, five are from the North; Tambuwal (North West); Saraki (North Central); Atiku, Bal Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen (North East).\n\nThe aspirants are engaged in intense consultations ahead of the June 4 INEC deadline for parties to produce their presidential flag bearers, amid the raging debate about zoning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNorthern presidential aspirants on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have continued with their quest to ensure that the next president of Nigeria comes from their region.\n\nThe four aspirants, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Bauch State Governor Bala Mohammed, his Sokoto State counterpart, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, and renowned banking guru, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen \u2013 are proceeding with their mission in spite of Southern governors\u2019 insistence that the next president should come from the South since the present president comes from the North.\n\nYesterday, the four Northern presidential hopefuls were at the hilltop home of former head of state, Gen Ibrahim Babangida (retd) in pursuit of their quest to have at a consensus aspirant from the North.\n\nTellingly, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was not in attendance. Atiku was the PDP presidential candidate in the last general election and this is his sixth declaration for president.\n\nIn an earlier comment, the presidential aspirants said when they arrive at a consensus candidate, they would communicate their position to Atiku. They, however, had a closed-door meeting with Atiku earlier this week on the consensus issue.\n\nApart from Hayatu-Deen who recently joined the presidential race, the other four aspirants, Atiku, Saraki, Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed, had individually visited Babangida for endorsement.\n\nDuring their visit yesterday, Saraki explained their mission to the former military leader.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is that desire to make a better Nigeria that those of us who are aspiring to be president put our heads together that we must have a consensus so that we can reduce the number to ensure that a candidate that is most competent, who has the support of everybody else, emerges.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do that just among us. We need leaders like Gen. Babangida here to also give us their own advice and bless the process. That\u2019s why we are here. We would be doing further consultations.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his reply, General Babangida gave a tacit approval to the idea of consensus and praised them for putting the country first in their quest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe told the delegation: \u201cI enjoyed meeting with you because I like what I heard. Your belief in the unity of this country is most paramount. Your belief in having a better Nigeria featured prominently in the course of your discussion. And You have made my day, that all you talked about was Nigeria, Nigeria, Nigeria,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cI want you to keep that one up for the benefit of this country and for the generations yet unborn. What you are doing is good. This is how the country should develop \u2013 consultations, compromises and so on. This is what will make the country go on. And, this is what you are trying to do. You will have our support as long as you will stay the course of promoting Nigeria all the time, making it a secure country.\u201d\n\nYoung Professionals Pick PDP Forms For Obi\n\nMeanwhile, vice presidential candidate of the PDP and former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, has picked the PDP presidential forms for the 2023 election.\n\nThe expression of interest and nomination forms were purchased on his behalf by a group of his supporters under the aegis of Likeminds for Peter Obi, at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja yesterday.\n\nSpeaking for the group, Ekene Nwakuche, who said the group\u2019s members do not belong to any political party, added that Obi has what it takes to manage a country like Nigeria.\n\nNwakuche said the country needs a seasoned technocrat who can steer the affairs of the country in the right direction and cut down the cost of governance, explaining that the group was made up of professionals, businessmen, public servants, contractors, artisans and so on.\n\n\u201cWe have members from everywhere in Nigeria, we\u2019re fully represented. So, we want the country to move forward. We think Peter Obi can steer it forward and we believe in him because we\u2019ve seen what he did in Anambra when he was a governor,\u201d he said, adding that Obi has the wealth of experience to lead Nigeria to the promised land.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in this thing because of any gain. We\u2019re doing it because of our children to come, because if we don\u2019t get it right this time around, this 2023, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be.\n\n\u201cEach of us here know how the country is and we want a better Nigeria. And I believe that if you\u2019re from Nigeria, be it from the north, south, east, west, and you know, you want a better Nigeria, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other person that you\u2019ll support than Peter Obi.\u201d\n\nUrging the PDP to allow Obi to fly the flag of the party in the coming election, he pointed out that another non-partisan group, Take Back Nigeria, had earlier pledged to deliver 10 million youth votes to Obi if he emerges the PDP flag bearer.\n\nSaraki Visits Delta, Seeks Support of Delta PDP Delegates\n\nThe Abubakar Bukola Saraki Contact and Advocacy Council has declared that Dr Bukola Saraki will provide the right leadership for Nigeria especially at this point in time that the country is confronted with numerous challenges.\n\nSpeaking in Asaba, the Delta State capital, yesterday, the leader of the Council, Prof Iyorwuese Hagher, said the group was in Delta State to canvass support of the PDP delegates for actualisation of Saraki\u2019s presidential ambition in 2023.\n\nHagher, a former presidential aspirant himself, and high commissioner to Canada, said Saraki\u2019s ambition was a direct manifestation of a failed government occasioned by the ineptitude of the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHe said, \u201cAs governor of Kwara State, he has a track record; as Senate president, he has a track record, a record of doing the right thing. As president of this country, Saraki has the political will to implement the much-needed change Nigeria desires.\u201d\n\nIn his response, the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta state, Chief Kingsley Esiso, said he had no doubt that Saraki was well-equipped to make a good president.\n\n\u201cHe (Saraki) is a man of intelligence and capacity. As the chairman of our party\u2019s reconciliatory committee, he has done very well to unite the party\u201d, the Delta PDP chairman said, adding that he would \u201crelate the message of the council to the leaders of the party and the governor of Delta State.\u201d",

          "title": "We Can\u2019t Complete Ajaokuta Plant Before Leaving In 2023 \u2013 Federal Govt",
          "text": "The federal government has made a policy volte face on the Ajaokuta steel rolling mill, saying the Buhari administration can no longer complete the project in 2022 as earlier promised.\n\nMinister of mines and steel development, Olamilekan Adegbite, disclosed this yesterday while addressing State House correspondents during the special weekly briefing coordinated by the presidential media team at the presidential villa.\n\nAccording to him, the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic have frustrated the project on several fronts despite the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved $2 million for the project.\n\nThe minister who regretted that the company may not be fully revived under the current administration as earlier promised said, \u201cWhere we are today, we may not be able to get Ajaokuta to work but I pray that we can start something permanent. I\u2019ve said it before when we came back from Russia. Yes, I went to the public and said \u2018look, we will deliver Ajaokuta before the end of this tenure\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd I pray that I\u2019ll have a chance to go back and apologise and explain what happened to the people before I leave office. It is due to no fault of ours. Everybody was ready to go, but unfortunately, COVID came in. So, it is a force majeure\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdegbite further explained that the government moved to continue negotiations with Russia after the lockdown, but progress was again stalled due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn October 2019, Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari and Russia\u2019s Vladmir Putin met at the Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi and agreed to revive the uncompleted Ajaokuta steel mill but the project suffered force majeure due to COVID-19\u201d\n\nThough he did not name the British firm, the minister however stated that the arrangements with the Russian firm failed as the contract was awarded to a company with both Russians and Ukrainian interests.\n\nHe disclosed that the $2 million is safe in the federal government account, adding that \u201cthe money has not even been given to anybody.\n\n\u201cThe Russians can\u2019t get any payment now with the way things are happening in the world. All their accounts are blocked.\n\n\u201cSo, the $2 million is still with the federal government; it\u2019s just that the president has given the money for that purpose. We had started the process of procurement, then with this war; we can no longer go that way\u201d, he added.\n\nThe minister revealed that the British firm is offering to do it for Nigeria free now, noting that \u201cby the grace of God, we have started an irreversible process.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Ajaokuta is actually what we call force majeure. Nobody thought of the COVID, because the plan was to deliver Ajaokuta this year 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his achievements in office, Adegbite said his ministry is currently working on projects across the six geopolitical zones which would be commissioned by July this year,\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe listed some of the projects to include the launch of made in Nigeria barite, establishment of mining-related clusters in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria and Jewellery Making Training Center in Abuja where 45 students recruited from all the 36 States and FCT are being trained on Jewellery Making.\n\nAdegbite also revealed that the country had attained self-sufficiency in Barite production and would no longer need to import from October 2022.\n\nThe minister explained that the Buhari administration was doing everything within its powers to upgrade the sector.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe are going to auction bitumen in June; this will bring a lot of money. A lot of foreign companies are showing interest in our bitumen. This is even better than bitumen is found in Canada.\n\n\u201cSo, we have a lot of Canadian companies who have shown interest, because Canada supplies the largest volume of bitumen to the world now. We have a lot of companies coming from Canada. They want to participate in our bitumen project that will create jobs, give value to the government, and of course, also help when it comes to our projects and road construction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are about to conclude the bitumen auction; we have completed the automation of the Mining Cadastre System to meet international full standards for online mining title and license applications and approvals.\u201d\n\nHe said the ministry also has a large scale gold production platform through the Segilola Gold project and proposed refining through Dukia Gold and Kian Smith.\n\n\u201cThe famous Ladi Kwali Pottery Center is being remodeled and resuscitated to train Nigerians in Modern pottery and ceramic works.\u201d\n\nAdegbite noted that the Nigeria Mining Development Company (NMDC) had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) to produce alloys hitherto imported from China.\n\n\u201cUnder the MoU, Brass will be processed for Armament and Lead for Ammunition. We have repositioned the SMDF and we are finalizing an amendment to the act to further institutionalize the fund along global best practices\u201d, he noted.\n\nAdegbite revealed that Nigeria has commenced gold exports through the Segilola resource development, which is expected to export 100, 000 ounces of gold annually.\n\n\u201cTheir production capacity is 100,000 ounces per annum. You can plan on that. We know how much we are charging per ounce of gold at that rate. So you know that in a year, this is what we are expecting. We charge at 3 per cent but the price will vary because our price is based on the cost that is going at the international market, the New York exchange will quote the price of gold at any particular point in time.\n\n\u201cGold went as high as $2,500 per ounce at one point. And I think it is worth about $2,200 now on the stock exchange. So this is the price as used to calculate that,\u201d he said\n\nOn gold mining in Zamfara State, the minister said the government had halted mining activities in the area because the conflict went beyond mining.\n\nOn the government\u2019s effort against illegal mining, he said, \u201cWe try to nip them in the bud wherever they rear their heads. With the community reporting to us, we have a quick intervention force. We can\u2019t be proactive; it is too expensive to maintain. But we have a quick intervention force.\n\n\u201cIf we hear any mining happening in any nook and cranny, we move in there and dislodge them. Those that are arrested, we confiscate their equipment and they are prosecuted,\u201d the minister noted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister disclosed that the government was reviewing the Mining Act, 2007 to bring it up to date, saying 44 solid minerals have been found in over 500 locations in Nigeria with many in commercial quantities.\n\nAccording to him, the mineral deposits are broadly categorized according to their uses into five groups.",

          "text": "House of Representatives yesterday abruptly adjourned plenary and suspended all legislative activities till next week to register displeasure over the recent killings in Kaduna State.\n\nThe House adjourned the plenary after intensive debate on the security situation in the country following a motion of urgent public importance moved by Shehu Balarabe, a member representing Birnin Gwari/Giwa federal constituency of Kaduna State.\n\nBalarabe lamented that armed bandits had in the last one week invaded the two local government areas he represents and killed scores, raped, maimed, displaced many and destroyed property worth millions of naira.\n\nWhile contributing to the motion, leader of the House, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, said Nigerians should be allowed to take up arms and defend themselves against gunmen attacks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDoguwa said there is a \u201cmonumental failure\u201d in the security architecture in the country.\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, I rise to speak in the capacity of the majority leader who of course is the ambassador of the government on this floor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government especially a democratic one that was elected by the people is to ensure the safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens. Mr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by the government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but day in, day out, there are killings, massacre, armed robbery all over. Left, right and centre.\n\n\u201cThis is a report from just one local government out of 774. Giwa local government and the case of Giwa is not just a new case, he (mover of the motion) is only giving us the most recent happening. Giwa has been engulfed by banditry and killings in the last two to three years.\n\n\u201cGiwa has coincidentally fallen in a state (Kaduna) where you have the representation of the Nigerian military and other security agencies \u2013 the highest place you can count is in the northern part of the country. Why should this thing continue to happen?\n\n\u201cThe government in this case has to rise to its responsibility. Call a spade, a spade.\n\nIf it is about funding, each of us here knows we have never had any cause to contemplate not funding our security agencies.\n\nI believe our relevant committees are following up in terms of implementation of such funding through our budget, their oversight processes. Why should things continue this way? We are here for the Nigerian people and we must speak for Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said they cannot sit down and fold their arms, while the electorates that voted them into offices are being killed. He lamented the institutional and regimental failures, saying that the security agencies have no excuse for their failures. He noted that the House had always made sure that they got the funding they needed and wondered the reason why they have failed to protect the people.\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, with all sense of commitment, with the fact that yes, even after this world we shall all rise to answer our fathers\u2019 name in the next world to account for actions. I think Nigerians should at this moment be allowed to also take arms.\n\n\u201cNigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard-earned resources and properties because it is like a monumental failure.\n\n\u201cIf the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failures. Let Nigerians organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let them organise and raise a defence for their innocent souls because if the responsibility of the government and the security agencies cannot be carried out democratically, then let\u2019s go to the jungle,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a member of the House, Hon Nasir Ahmed also called for the sack of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj-Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd). Ahmed said, \u201cDo we have a national security adviser?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAre we saying the army, the Nigerian navy, air force, police and DSS with all the training that they have had, with all the international training that they have gone to \u2014 they have gone to peacekeeping. That a ragtag army of 16 to 17 year-old-boys (bandits) is more powerful than them?\n\n\u201cMr Speaker this madness has to stop. It simply has to stop. You travel by road you\u2019re kidnapped; you go by train, you\u2019re kidnapped, last week the airport was attacked by bandits; you sit at home you\u2019re kidnapped, you send your children to school they are kidnapped. Mr Speaker a few weeks ago somebody was kidnapped in a hospital. Where are you going to stay? You can be kidnapped right in this chamber.\n\n\u201cWhat do we tell our people that elected us? Do we just fold our arms? I want to use this opportunity again and I am calling on the national security adviser \u2014 he must be removed.\u201d",

Violent attacks are frequent and there is a high threat of kidnap,\u201d the post read.\n\n\u201cOn 26 March 2022, gunmen launched an attack against Kaduna airport, killing at least one airport official in the latest in a series of attacks by gunmen in the north of Nigeria. On the evening of 29 March 2022, an apparent Improvised Explosive Device attack took place against a train travelling from Abuja to Kaduna. Reports suggest that a number of people were killed and that others were abducted by gunmen. Train services are now suspended between Abuja and Kaduna.\u201d\n\nIt further warned that there is a threat from extremists linked to Boko Haram or the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa states.\n\n\u201cThe threat level in North-East Nigeria, including around Maiduguri is increasing, particularly around transport hubs, religious areas, and large gatherings. Kidnaps have taken place on the roads in and out of Maiduguri. As the dry season starts in October, this risk is expected to increase even further,\u201d the advisory further said.\n\n\u201cIf the security situation in Maiduguri were to deteriorate any further, there is a significant likelihood that it could be extremely difficult for you to leave the city. We do not advise travelling by road.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the North East against FCDO advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation and make sure your procedures and contingency plans are up to date.

When we came back from Russia, yes, I went to the public and said, \u2018look we will deliver Ajaokuta before the end of this tenure\u2019. And I pray that I\u2019ll have a chance to go back and apologise and explain what happened to the people before I leave office.\n\n\u201cIt is due to no fault of ours.

This helped in making access to credit easier and affordable for Nigerians as well as supporting the diversification agenda.\n\nBuhari addressed the gathering via a video conferencing. Dignitaries physically present at the unveiling of the BoI edifice included Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Adeniyi Adebayo; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele; Chairman of BoI, Mallam Aliyu AbdulRahman Dikko; and the bank\u2019s Managing Director/Chief Executive, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, as well as development partners.\n\nThe president expressed optimism that with the raising of a \u20ac700 million Eurobond, the BoI would be able to provide more funding for the growth of businesses in the country.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nHe said, \u201cI am particularly impressed that this world-class building will finance internally generated revenue of the bank.

Through the Bank of Industry, this government extended the single-digit interest rate loans.\n\n\u201cAs part of this mandate, the Bank of Industry disbursed over N1.4 trillion to micro, SMEs, and large enterprises, creating over nine million jobs from its inception.\u201d\n\nAdebayo said BoI had added significant value to the federal government\u2019s industrialisation agenda over the past 62 years and thanked the president and other arms of government for their confidence in the bank.\n\nBuhari said the DFI had been appointed as the implementation partner for several laudable projects towards alleviating poverty, job creation as well as ensuring affordable financing opportunities for Nigerian enterprises.\n\nEmefiele, in his remarks, said all the credit must be given to Buhari for setting the pace for the country\u2019s development and economic diversification as well as the restructuring of the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe noted BoI was jointly owned by the CBN and the Federal Ministry of Finance, stressing that the central bank has been working closely with the DFI to ensure that it achieves its mandate.\n\nThe CBN governor said, \u201cSince 2014 when I assumed leadership at the CBN, we have ensured that we work closely with BoI to ensure that their core mandate, which is to provide finance for the development of not just the Small and Medium Enterprises but also our large corporate.\n\n\u201cThat they are able to complement our efforts in achieving the vision that has been set by President Muhammadu Buhari that says that we should work together to make sure we make finance available to Nigerians and not just make finance available to Nigerians but also make this finance available at affordable interest rates.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI will continue to give the credit to the president for setting the vision for the development and diversification of the Nigerian economy. Not just development and diversification but also ensuring that we really work hard to restructure the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cFrom being an import-dependent economy to an economy that is self-sufficient and economy that develops itself and ensures that we reduce imports and begin to export and produce.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said Nigeria has the potential to grow not just its economy but also the economy of other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe BoI managing director disclosed that the bank had raised about $4 billion from over 100 international banks/investors in over 20 countries within the past four years, adding that most of the funds ended up as part of the country\u2019s foreign reserve.\n\nWhile thanking Buhari for the renewal of his tenure and that of the chairman for another five years, Pitan assured that the board would work harder and, \u201ccomplete our succession planning project, which is on-going with our consultants, Price Waterhouse.\u201d\n\nPitan said through the president\u2019s support, BoI had been able to approach the international capital market and conclude various funding transactions, including a $750 million syndicated medium-term loan in 2018, which had now been fully paid; \u20ac1billion syndicated loan in March 2020; $1billion syndicated loan in December 2020; and recently the \u20ac750million Senior Eurobond (the first by any African national DFI) in February 2022, whose sovereign guarantee was also approved by the National Assembly.\n\nThe BoI MD added that these funds had significantly improved the bank\u2019s capacity to continually support Nigeria\u2019s real sector.\n\nOn his part, Dikko said the commissioning was an important milestone for the bank, as it signifies the culmination of many years of tenacity and determination to ensure that the edifice was completed and put to judicious use.\n\nHe said judging by the increasing profile of the bank and its operations, the new building should open new business frontiers for the country in general.\n\nAccording to him, for decades, BoI has delivered appreciable results on its mandate towards transforming the country\u2019s industrial sector by providing affordable and long-term financing across key segments and sectors of the economy.\n\nThe BoI chairman said in the last five years alone, working with strategic partners, the bank had supported over 3.2 million MSMEs as well as large enterprises, and created over 7.1 million direct and indirect jobs in the process.\n\nHe added that the bank\u2019s total assets also grew from N683 billion in 2016 to N1.7 trillion in 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cBOI has consistently aligned its corporate strategy with the strategic objectives of the federal government, especially as it relates to industrialisation and job creation; from Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan, to Economic Recovery and Growth Plan; and now to the newly introduced National Development Plan.\n\n\u201cTo that end, the bank has been a reliable partner in managing several intervention projects and funds targeted towards entrepreneurship, economic rehabilitation and poverty eradication on behalf of the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe BoI Tower 2 is a state-of-the-art innovative building with 12 lettable floors with unique features, which include energy-conserving smart lighting system that is motion activated, back-up power system with special panels that are synchronised to deliver power according to demand and high diesel efficiency.\n\nThe facility is also built with a building management system, which monitors, supervises, controls and reports on smart building technology systems, including generators, CCTVs, and other gadgets.\n\nDeji Elumoye and James Emejo in Abuja",

          "text": "The market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) gained N3.02 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, notwithstanding the growing insecurity concerns in the country.\n\nThe market performance was buoyed by impressive corporate earnings by major listed companies that saw some of them delivering robust dividend payout to shareholders.\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation gained N3.02 trillion to close on March 31, 2022, at N25.312 trillion, higher than the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021.\n\nThe NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed companies on the Exchange, also rose by 9.95 per cent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first Q1 2022.\n\nData compiled by THISDAY revealed that the sectoral performance of the NGX was bullish, as most indices closed the period on uptrend as at March 25, 2022.\n\nFor instance, the NGX Oil & Gas Index appreciated the most by 28.12 per cent. It was closely followed by the NGX Banking Index, which recorded a gain of 8.55 per cent, while the NGX Premium Board Index rose by 6.34 per cent.\n\nOthers were the NGX Pension, NGX Industrial Goods, NGX 30, and NGX Lotus II that went up by 6.34 per cent, 5.63 per cent, 5.39 per cent, 4.37 per cent, and 1.18 per cent, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the NGX Insurance and NGX Consumer Goods recorded year-to-date decline of 6.35 per cent and 4.21 per cent respectively, as at March 25, 2022.\n\nOn a monthly review, the Nigerian bourse witnessed positive price movements leading to a bull-run throughout January 2020, during which it closed with a 9.1 per cent month-on-month growth in the All-Share Index, and extended the gains by 1.7 per cent in February. During the period, BUA Foods got listed, boosting the market capitalisation by N720 billion.\n\nSpeaking on the market performance in Q1 2022, Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said the stock market sustained positive sentiment and uptrend due to the influx of corporate actions and 2021 audited financials, as players reacted to the released numbers and dividend declared for year-end 2021 earnings.\n\nOmordion said that was expected to support an uptrend during the earnings season, amid the oscillating oil prices, just as the market continues to interpret economic data in relationship with crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.\n\n\u201cThis resulted in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks, as 2021 Q4 GDP was up at 3.98 per cent, while the International Monetary Fund called for a hike in the interest rate and further devaluation of the naira,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the market outlook, Omordion projected mixed sentiment trading by investors in April and beyond, saying all eyes would be on the performance of the economy and how the country\u2019s economic managers would navigate challenges, which included insecurity and activities externally.\n\nAccording to him, investors would also be concerned about on-going war in Ukraine, energy supply chain distortion that had been one of the major factors driving inflation, insecurity, among other factors that have pushed cost of production, goods and services higher.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo invest profitably in this changing environment, you need investment education, trading plans and trading tools/software. These will help manage risk associated with volatility and unstable markets.\u201d\n\nAn analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye, said investors priced in the dividend payout out by the listed companies, which according to him drove market performance.\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cInvestors have already priced in the dividend in January and February and that is why the market maintained positive growth during the period. However, there was profit-taking in March as most investors did not bother to wait for the dividend payment date.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that in April, the stock market might witness cautious investors\u2019 trading due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy.\n\nKayode Tokede",

          "title": "Nigeria: Challenged By Train Attack, Doubted by a Nervous Nation, Military Launches Offensive against Terrorists",
          "text": "Determined to punish Monday\u2019s attack on a Kaduna-bound train, which killed eight passengers and left scores unaccounted for, the military, yesterday, launched a counter-offensive against terrorists suspected of links with the bombing incident, killing 34 of them through air strikes.\n\nThe attack created deep fears in citizens and doubt about the ability of the military to defend the country\u2019s democracy and territorial integrity.\n\nIn their reaction to the incident, members of the House of Representatives, yesterday, expressed serious worry over the worsening insecurity in the country and lamented that nowhere was safe any longer. The lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd). They accused the security agencies of profiting from the increasing insecurity in the country.\n\nSimilarly, House Majority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, accused the government of failing to live up to expectations. Ado-Doguwa suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms in self-defence.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, decried some of the public words of the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. The main opposition party said such words tended to confirm its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts as well as plans of the terrorists, and deliberately refused to act.\n\nThe air interdiction came as troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) killed scores of insurgents during a clash in the Lake Chad area.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nNigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial deliveries, to aid the fight against terrorism.\n\nA military update issued in Abuja, on Thursday, said 34 terrorists were decimated in waves of air strikes.\n\nThe update said, \u201cIn receiving credible information that at about 2.pm on 30 March 2022, about 70 terrorists on 40 motorcycles and some on foot were sighted moving towards the Akilibu-Sarkin Pawa Road, near Mangoro Village, the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike swiftly scrambled an aircraft to intercept and neutralise the terrorists.\n\n\u201cAs the aircraft approached the scene, several terrorist were seen running in disarray on sighting the aircraft, abandoning their motorcycles to take cover within nearby bushes.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists were subsequently engaged in different waves with rockets while those fleeing were mopped up with canons decisively. Feedback from local sources around Mangoro Village, disclosed that 17 motorcycles including 34 dead bodies as well as 14 locally fabricated guns belonging to the terrorist were recovered.\u201d\n\nA source said some of the terrorists fled with multiple gunshot wounds during the encounter, but it was still unclear what roles they played in the attack that killed eight passengers onboard the Kaduna-bound train, with many injured and undetermined number abducted.\n\nMeanwhile, an emergency intelligence meeting coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency after the train attack identified three locations as \u201cdestinations\u201d of bandits after most attacks within the axis.\n\nThe meeting, according to PRNigeria, also considered immediate deployment of integrated security surveillance and monitoring solutions for the rail line.\n\nThe locations identified by the intelligence service as bandit dens are in Rijana, Katari and Kasarami.\n\nThe places have proximity to the Kaduna-Abuja highway and rail lines.\n\n\u201cThese locations are abodes to kidnappers, armed bandits, drug addicts, gun runners, prostitutes and fleeing Boko Haram terrorists,\u201d a senior intelligence source revealed.\n\nThe officer further disclosed that a \u201cmassive joint security operation\u201d would commence in the areas, simultaneously with the support of recently acquired drones.\n\nThe source added, \u201cSome of the services have recently acquired sophisticated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the drones to improve surveillance and ensure precisions on attacks on targets.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate collateral damages in the initial stages of the operation, even though we will ensure maximum protection of innocent citizens.\n\n\u201cProper identification exercises of people in the areas would be conducted.\u201d\n\nThe meeting of the intelligence operatives was on the heels of a security parley between President Muhammadu Buhari and the service chiefs.\n\nBuhari had given the service chiefs the marching order to find lasting solutions to the incessant attacks on motorists and train passengers by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nPrior to their meeting with Buhari, the duo of Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, and Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruq Yahaya, undertook an assessment visit to the scene of the attack.\n\nIn another development, troops of the MNJTF, Operation Hadin Kai, eliminated scores of fighters of terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the on-going clearance operations around Lake Chad region.\n\nSecurity sources said troops successfully cleared Cemente, Bagadaza, Zanari and Wulgo in Gamborun Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nA source said, \u201cThere were two encounters with the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgents at Zanari and also at the harbour area. Troops were decisive in both attacks.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the troops also rescued 21 women, 11 male children and nine female children in the operations, which commenced on March 28, 2022.\n\nSome of the items recovered in the aftermath of the encounter included two gun trucks, 22 bicycles, 18 motorcycles (destroyed in situ), two Rockets Propelled Grenade (RPG) tubes, three Rockets Propelled Grenade Bombs, one NBST Gun, two General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), three GPMG belts, 600 rounds of 7.62 MM NATO, and one FN Rifle magazine, among others.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial delivery.\n\nSpeaking during a courtesy visit to the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGoF), Surv. Abudulganiyu Adeyemi Adebomehin, the Chief of Intelligence of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Abubakar Liman, said the purpose of his visit was to seek areas of further collaboration with OSGoF, because of its expertise, skills and data required to aid NAF in its operations.\n\nHe solicited synergy with relevant authorities especially, in the war against insecurity, stating that, \u201csecurity is everyone\u2019s business. War is a national assignment,\u201d which required the support of every citizen.\n\nThe intelligence chief reiterated the significance of the role of OSGoF in the war against criminality in the country.\n\nIn his response, Adebomehin said OSGoF, an extra-ministerial establishment of the federal government as the apex mapping arm and responsible for implementing the survey coordination act of the country, was ready to provide all resources at its disposal for the success of the operations of NAF and other arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces. He disclosed that his office produced navigational charts for the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), which was certified by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). He added that OSGoF had acquired more sophisticated equipment and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as a digital printing outfit.\n\nAdebomehin stressed that the surveyors and other staff were already undergoing series of training and retraining in readiness to provide geo-spatial needs of the government, its MDAs, and other sectors of the economy.\n\nOutraged Lawmakers Say Nowhere is Safe in Nigeria\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives on Thursday expressed concerns over the worsening insecurity in the country, lamenting that nowhere is safe in the country anymore. Reacting to the recent attacks by terrorists on Kaduna airport and train, the lawmakers, while debating a motion of urgent national importance on the killings in Giwa, took turns to fault the security agencies and the federal government for their failure to end killings by terrorists and other criminal elements.\n\nHon. Shehu Balarabe (APC, Kaduna), while moving his motion, lamented that his local government had been ravaged by the series of attacks by bandits, who indulged in killings, kidnapping, raping, robbery and destruction of property. He said between 24 and 28 of March, bandits had unleashed attacks on those communities, killing over 117 people, while some corpses were yet to be recovered.\n\nThe lawmaker also claimed that more than 136 people were abducted, while over 10, 463 others had been displaced from their homes.\n\nContributing, Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau) called for suspension of funds appropriated for security agencies until they showed what they had achieved with what had been released to them over the years.\n\nMajority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms to defend themselves. He said, \u201cI arise to speak in the capacity of the Majority Leader, who of course, is the ambassador of government on this floor. When you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government, especially, a democratic one which was elected by the people is to ensure safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens.\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis, those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but we continue day in, day out \u2013 killings, massacre, armed robbery all over \u2013 left, right and centre. Government in this case has to rise up to its responsibility, call a spade, a spade.\n\n\u201cOn account of this institutional failure, regimental failure on the part of our security agencies, because you have just no cause to raise excuse, funding is provided, here we are now as an institution, we have now sent invitation, come and meet with the people of Nigeria, come and interface with us.\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, I think Nigerians should this moment be allowed to also take arms. Nigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard earned properties, because it is like a monumental failure, if the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failure.\n\n\u201cLet Nigerian organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let\u2019s organise defence for their innocent souls, because if the responsibility of the government cannot be carried out democratically, then, everyone has the cause to defend himself. Nigerians should no longer be running away from attacks, unnecessary bandits.\u201d\n\nAhmed Jaha (APC, Borno) was of the view that security matter in Nigeria has become a cash cow business, accusing security agencies of profiting from it.\n\nJaha said, \u201cIn 2021, we budgeted N460 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only N29 billion was for capital expenditure, the remaining was for recurrent expenditure. In 2022, we budgeted N571 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only 37 billion is capital expenditure, the remaining were recurrent expenditure.\n\n\u201cMr speaker the truth of the matter is security in Nigeria has become a cash cow business. I am not willing to go without taking my own and he is not willing to go without taking his own and the other person is not willing to leave until when he got his own.\n\n\u201cIt is a cash cow business. They don\u2019t want it to finish, because they will realise that everybody\u2019s attention was diverted towards north-east. Okay, let them release north-east to some extent and go to north-west, after north-west, they move to south-west. Before you realise what is happening, the whole country is gutted with security challenges.\u201d\n\nHowever, after being chided by Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, he withdrew his comment and said he was not going to deal with him.\n\nBut Hon. Nasiru Ali Ahmed (APC, Kano) called for the sack or resignation of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), for failing to curb insecurity in the country. Ahmed recalled when the service chiefs were sacked and IG of Police changed, adding that no one was indispensable.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSince 2015, the inspector general of police, service chiefs have been changed. But the NSA has not been changed. The Army, Navy, Police, DSS all of these agencies are accountable to the National Security Adviser. From what I heard, most of these criminals were 16, 18 years old boys. Are we saying that the Nigerian Army, police, DSS, Air Force with all the training that they have had, all the international training, they have gone for peacekeeping.\n\n\u201cAre they now saying these 18 years old boys are more powerful than them? You travel by road, you are kidnapped; you go by train, you are kidnapped; you sit at home, you\u2019re kidnapped. So, where are we going to stay. You can be kidnapped right in this chamber. I\u2019m calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser, he must be removed. He has been there for seven years, what has happened?\u201d\n\nWase, who presided over the session, however, disagreed with Ahmed, saying, calling for the sack of NSA might not be the solution to the issue. He noted that despite President Muhammadu Buhari changing the service chiefs, nothing has changed to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\nWhile blaming the judiciary for not prosecuting arrested culprits, he assured the people that the parliament would continue their investigative duties and anyone found wanting would not be spared, suggesting that activities for the day be suspended and prayers offered in solidarity with the lives lost to insecurity across the country.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, urged the federal government to implement recommendations contained in the House security summit, held last year.\n\nIn a related development, Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos), told THISDAY that his committee and other security committees of the House would engage with the heads of the various services with a view to thoroughly and effectively analysing the incident (and other similar occurrences), proffering and implementing lasting and sustainable solutions.\n\nBenson said, \u201cThe recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train is yet another sad and regrettable security breach. As a committee, we are saddened and highly disturbed by the incident and the brazen audacity of the bandits. We believe that Nigerians should enjoy adequate security everywhere they go. We, therefore, see this as a major setback that must be addressed immediately, especially, considering the current fear of traveling by road along that route.\u201d\n\nHouse Beams Searchlight on Own Security Committees\n\nThe House of Representatives resolved to look into the activities of its standing committees on security, to see how effectively they were carrying out their oversight functions on the security agencies.\n\nThe committees included Navy, Army, Air Force, Defence, Interior and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nContributing to a motion on the recent killings in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, noted that a lot needed to be done to stem the tide of insecurity. He wondered if one report had ever been turned in by the Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know one report that has been turned in by Committee on National Security and Intelligence. I don\u2019t know,\u201d mandating the relevant security committees of the House to step up their oversight functions as well as conclude the reports of their investigations.\n\nChief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno, frowned on the slow pace with which the Committee on National Security and Intelligence carried out assignments.\n\nMonguno said, \u201cWith regard to the committee, I can also recall that the first bill that was passed for second reading is my bill, which is the bill on small arms and light weapons. That bill was referred to the national security committee, but up till now, there is no report. Up to the extent that they had to go and appeal to Mr Speaker, which he had to set up an ad hoc committee. That is the extent the committee has not performed.\u201d\n\nPDP: El-Rufai, Amaechi\u2019s Confessions Confirm APC\u2019s Complicity\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Thursday, said the public utterances by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, confirmed its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts and plans of the terrorists ravaging the nation but deliberately refused to act.\n\nPDP also said the comments by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, that some members of the APC-led Federal Executive Council (FEC) frustrated his request to install security surveillance equipment to avert terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track, confirmed that the APC administration had been creating safety nets for terrorists to freely operate in our country.\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said in exposing the APC government, which he was a part of, el-Rufai said, \u201cWe know where their camps are, we know where they are, the SSS has their phone numbers, they listen to them and they give me report\u2026\u201d\n\nThe PDP said that in his own confession, the Minister of Transportation said, \u201cWe knew what the problems would be. We knew we needed to have digital security equipment\u2026I warned that lives will be lost and now lives are lost\u2026 When you come with sincerity to government and your colleagues are stopping you, it is annoying\u201d.\n\nPDP, therefore, said, \u201cThese revelation from high-ranking APC public officials, who are in the position to know, is troubling as they are unequivocal confirmation that APC leaders are in league with terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not surprising that President Muhammadu Buhari insists on retaining a self-confessed terrorist apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, to continue to head the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, which is indispensable in any meaningful fight against terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\nPolice Defuse Another IED in Kaduna\n\nAnother Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted in Rigasa area of Kaduna was defused by the Nigeria Police on Thursday.\n\nThe bomb, the police said, was planted a few kilometres to the Train Station.\n\nOn March 26, 2022, four people were injured in an explosion planted in Danmani community in Rigasa area.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of the state police command, Mohammed Jalige, said the latest IED was planted in the area by yet to be identified persons.\n\nHe said the IED was sighted by residents of the area about 07:50 hours and they promptly reported to the police.\n\n\u201cIn a swift response, the Command\u2019s Explosive Ordinance Department (EOD) swung into action and successful defused the IED, without any loss of lives or property.\n\n\u201cThe acting Commissioner of Police DCP Maiyaki Baba, thanks the residents of the area for their vigilance and prompt reporting of the incidence and assures them that the command will always prioritise the safety of the public,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement advised members of the public to always report suspicious movement or persons in their communities, noting that such information would be treated in full confidentiality.\n\nHe, however, said normalcy had since been restored in the area and residents were going about their normal business.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has debunked reports that motorists were stranded along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, when terrorists barricaded the road.\n\nIn a statement, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the reports were not true.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cA few hours ago, some panic was spread on social media over bandits barricading the Kaduna-Abuja Road and kidnapping citizens plying the route. The buzz in circulation is false and was presented by a group of social media enthusiasts, who celebrate negative news.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary operational feedback showed that fleeing bandits escaping a military onslaught attempted to pass through a narrow corridor around Kasarami general area of Kaduna-Abuja road. The troops, on receiving this intelligence, hurriedly moved to the location and engaged them in the adjoining forest.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said the government would update members of the public whenever more detailed feedback was received.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government does not deny the existence of security challenges and continues to work assiduously with relevant military and security agencies,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nChuks Okocha, Kingsley Nwezeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna",
          "summary": "The lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd).\nThe Army, Navy, Police, DSS all of these agencies are accountable to the National Security Adviser.\nI\u2019m calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser, he must be removed.\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know one report that has been turned in by Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\nThat bill was referred to the national security committee, but up till now, there is no report.",

          "text": "Wilfred Tebah doesn\u2019t begrudge the U.S. for swiftly granting humanitarian protections to Ukrainians escaping Russia\u2019s devastating invasion of their homeland.\n\nBut the 27-year-old, who fled Cameroon during its ongoing conflict, can\u2019t help but wonder what would happen if the millions fleeing that Eastern Europe nation were a different hue.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAs the U.S. prepares to welcome tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing war, the country continues to deport scores of African and Caribbean refugees back to unstable and violent homelands where they\u2019ve faced rape, torture, arbitrary arrest and other abuses.\n\n\u201cThey do not care about a Black man,\u201d the Columbus, Ohio, resident said, referring to U.S. politicians. \u201cThe difference is really clear. They know what is happening over there, and they have decided to close their eyes and ears.\u201d\n\nTebah\u2019s concerns echo protests against the swift expulsions of Haitian refugees crossing the border this summer without a chance to seek asylum, not to mention the frosty reception African and Middle Eastern refugees have faced in western Europe compared with how those nations have enthusiastically embraced displaced Ukrainians.\n\nIn March, when President Joe Biden made a series of announcements welcoming 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, granting Temporary Protected Status to another 30,000 already in the U.S. and halting Ukrainian deportations, two Democratic lawmakers seized on the moment to call for similar humanitarian considerations for Haitians.\n\n\u201cThere is every reason to extend the same level of compassion,\u201d U.S. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, and Mondaire Jones, of New York, wrote to the administration, noting more than 20,000 Haitians have been deported despite continued instability after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s president and a powerful earthquake this summer.\n\nCameroonian advocates have similarly ratcheted up their calls for humanitarian relief, protesting in front of the Washington residence of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the offices of leading members of Congress this month.\n\nTheir calls come as hundreds of thousands in Cameroon have been displaced in recent years by the country\u2019s civil war between its French-speaking government and English-speaking separatists, attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram and other regional conflicts.\n\nThe advocacy group Human Rights Watch, in a February report, found many Cameroonians deported from the U.S. suffered persecution and human rights violations upon returning there.\n\nTebah, who is a leading member of the Cameroon American Council, an advocacy group organizing protests this month, said that\u2019s a fate he hopes to avoid.\n\nHailing from the country\u2019s English-speaking northwest, he said he was branded a separatist and apprehended by the government because of his activism as a college student. Tebah said he managed to escape, as many Cameroonians have, by flying to Latin America, trekking overland to the U.S.-Mexico border and petitioning for asylum in 2019.\n\n\u201cI will be held in prison, tortured and even killed if I am deported,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very scared. As a human, my life matters too.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TPS and other humanitarian programs, declined to respond to the complaints of racism in American immigration policy. It also declined to say whether it was weighing granting TPS to Cameroonians or other African nationals, saying in a written statement only that it will \u201ccontinue to monitor conditions in various countries.\u201d\n\nThe agency noted, however, that it has recently issued TPS designations for Haiti, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan \u2014 all African or Caribbean nations \u2014 as well as to more than 75,000 Afghans living in the U.S. after the Taliban takeover of that Central Asian nation. Haitians are among the largest and longest-tenured beneficiaries of TPS, with more than 40,000 currently on the status.\n\nOther TPS countries include Burma, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, and the majority of the nearly 320,000 immigrants with Temporary Protected Status hail from El Salvador.\n\nLisa Parisio, who helped launch Catholics Against Racism in Immigration, argues the program could easily help protect millions more refugees fleeing danger but has historically been underused and over-politicized.\n\nTPS, which provides a work permit and staves off deportation for up to 18 months, doesn\u2019t have limits for how many countries or people can be placed on it, said Parisio, who is the advocacy director for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network.\n\nYet former President Donald Trump, in his broader efforts to restrict immigration, pared down TPS, allowing designations for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa to expire.\n\nAlthough programs like TPS provide critical protections for vulnerable refugees, they can also leave many in legal limbo for years without providing a pathway to citizenship, said Karla Morales, a 24-year-old from El Salvador who has been on TPS nearly her whole life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd to consider 20 years in this country temporary,\u201d the University of Massachusetts Boston nursing student said. \u201cWe need validation that the work we\u2019ve put in is appreciated and that our lives have value.\u201d\n\nAt least in the case of Ukraine, Biden appears motivated by broader foreign policy goals in Europe, rather than racial bias, suggests Mar\u00eda Cristina Garc\u00eda, a history professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, focused on refugees and immigrants.\n\nBut Tom Wong, founding director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center at the University of California, San Diego, said the racial disparities couldn\u2019t be clearer.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has responded without hesitation by extending humanitarian protections to predominately white and European refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the while, predominately people of color from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia continue to languish.\u201d\n\nBesides Cameroon, immigrant advocates also argue that Congo and Ethiopia should qualify for humanitarian relief because of their ongoing conflicts, as should Mauritania, since slavery is still practiced there.\n\nAnd they complain Ukrainian asylum seekers are being exempted from asylum limits meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 while\n\nthose from other nations are being turned away.\n\n\u201cBlack pain and Black suffering do not get the same attention,\u201d says Sylvie Bello, founder of the D.C.-based Cameroon American Council. \u201cThe same anti-Blackness that permeates American life also permeates American immigration policy.\u201d\n\nVera Arnot, a Ukrainian in Boston who is considering seeking TPS, says she didn\u2019t know much about the special status until the war started and wasn\u2019t aware of the concerns from immigrants of color. But the Berklee College of Music sophomore hopes the relief can be extended to other deserving nations.\n\nArnot says TPS could help her seek an off-campus job with better pay so she doesn\u2019t have to rely on her family\u2019s support, as most in Ukraine have lost their jobs due to the war.\n\n\u201cUkrainians as a people aren\u2019t used to relying on others,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to work. We don\u2019t want welfare.\u201d\n\nFor Tebah, who is staying with relatives in Ohio, TPS would make it easier for him to open a bank account, get a driver\u2019s license and seek better employment while he awaits a decision on his asylum case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to beg, to plead,\u201d Tebah said. \u201cWe are in danger. I want to emphasize it. And only TPS for Cameroon will help us be taken out of that danger. It is very necessary.\u201d\n\nAP",
