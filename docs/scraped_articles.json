          "title": "Muslim/Muslim ticket unacceptable, says CAN, NSCIA differs",
          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria has warned that two Muslims running on a joint presidential ticket in 2023 will not be acceptable and can lead to the country\u2019s collapse.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs led by the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Abubakar III, says the most important thing should be competence and that is what Muslims are praying for.\n\nThe Director-General of the Tinubu Support Group, Abdulmumin Jibrin, said on Monday that it did not matter if Tinubu picked a Muslim as his running mate, adding that Nigerians would choose competence over ethnic and religious considerations.\n\nJibrin argued that currently in the House of Representatives, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila; and the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, are both Muslims while in the 6th and 7th Senate, Senator David Mark and Ike Ekweremadu who are both Christians, were Senate President and Deputy Senate President respectively.\n\nIn his recently published book, a former interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Bisi Akande, also claimed that Tinubu was supposed to be the running mate to General Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 and to former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar in 2007 even though both Buhari and Atiku are Muslims just like Tinubu. Akande had argued that the South-West does not consider religion during elections.\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH on Tuesday, however, the Spokesman for the CAN President, Rev. Bayo Oladeji, said having a Muslim/Muslim ticket would set the country on fire. Oladeji also argued that CAN would not support two Christians running on a joint ticket in 2023.\n\nHe said the June 12, 1993 election wherein MKO Abiola of the Social Democratic Party ran alongside Babagana Kingibe on a joint Muslim ticket, could never be replicated in 2023.\n\nOladeji stated, \u201cPoliticians can talk politics but we have stated our view. Any party that tries Muslim/Muslim ticket or Christian/Christian ticket will fail. This is not 1993. Even when we have joint Muslim/Christians, the church still goes through hell. Only God knows the number of Christians that have been killed.\n\n\u201cImagine how bad it will be if we have two Muslims in power? The constitution promotes religious balance. So, if they want to try Muslim/Muslim ticket, let them try it. But we will not respond to faceless people. Let any political party or the government try it then they will know that Christians are not second hand citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis country belongs to all of us. If they try it, they will see it. Those who are planning Muslim/Muslim ticket should also find out what was the outcome of MKO Abiola and Kingibe ticket. If they try Muslim/Muslim ticket this time around, the outcome will be worse.\u201d\n\nBut the NSCIA, led by the Sultan of Sokoto, says Muslims believe that all power belongs to God and only those who God supports can emerge as winners of any election.\n\nWhen asked if the NSCIA saw anything wrong in a joint Muslim Presidential ticket, the Director of Administration, NSCIA, Zubairu Ugwu, told The PUNCH that while the council would continue to advocate for peace in the country, Muslims would pray to God to grant that only Nigerians who possessed the requisite capacity would eventually triumph at both their respective party primaries and subsequent general elections, at all tiers of government in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cConsequently, both the NSCIA and the Muslim Ummah of Nigeria who, in thought and practice, draw instructions from the Holy Qur\u2019an, have absolute trust that Almighty Allah has limitless capacity, to bring to power or deny power, in line with the above Qur\u2019anic injunction, to whomsoever He wills.\n\n\u201cAs Muslims, therefore, we have no choice but to continue to supplicate to Allah to grant that only Nigerians who possess the requisite capacity, integrity, sagacity, empathy, positive attitude, passion, administrative acumen, zeal for selfless service, etc., shall eventually triumph at both their respective party primaries and subsequent general elections, at all tiers of government in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said the NSCIA would continue to lend its voice to calls for all Nigerians, including political, religious, traditional and civil society organisations, to eschew religious politics and politicisation of religion, subtly or manifestly, in Nigeria, to avoid the dire consequences. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Cameroonian refugees protest deportation of separatist leaders, demand N68m",
          "text": "Refugees from the English speaking part of Cameroon (also known as Southern Cameroon), on Tuesday, protested against the refusal of the Federal Government to implement the judgment of Justice Anwuli Chikere of a Federal High Court in Abuja, which ordered the reversal of the deportation of 10 separatist leaders, who had applied for asylum in Nigeria.\n\nThe judgment, according to them, was secured by a team of Nigerian lawyers led by a human rights activist, Femi Falana (SAN).\n\nThe refugees made the demand during a protest in Abuja to commemorate the four-year anniversary of the arrest and extradition of over 49 of their leaders and others.\n\nThe leaders were said to have been arrested by security agencies at a hotel in the Jabi area of Abuja and other cities in Nigeria.\n\nThose arrested included the Assistant Vice-President, Marketing and Recruitment, American University of Nigeria, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe; Assistant Professor of Computing and Director, Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness and Vice Chair of the Institutional Review Board of AUN, Dr Fidelis Ndeh-Che; Head, Surgery Unit, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof Augustine Awasum; and Associate Professor of Geology, ABU, Dr Henry Kimeng.\n\nOthers were a senior lecturer in the Department of Economics, Yar\u2019Adua University, Dr Cornelius Kwanga; Associate Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, Bayero University, Kano, Dr Egbe Ogork; activist and leader of the Teachers\u2019 Union and the Federation of Parent Teachers Union, Wilfred Tassang; human rights lawyers, Shufai Berinyuy and Eyambe Elias; and civil society leader, Dr Nfor Ngalla Nfor.\n\nJustice Chikere had in her judgment held that the forced deportation of the Cameroonians was illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nShe held that irrespective of whether they posed a threat to the Nigerian state or not, the Federal Government did not follow due process and thus violated both the Nigerian constitution and articles 32 and 33 of the UN Convention relating to the status of refugees.\n\nWhile ordering their return to Nigeria, Justice Chikere also ordered the government to pay N67.8m in compensation to the deportees.\n\nSpeaking with journalists during the commemoration rally on Tuesday, the President, Association of Southern Cameroon Refugees in Nigeria, Ernest Cho, decried the non-implementation of the court judgment.\n\nAccording to him, by obeying the court ruling and repatriating the 10 leaders, who are seen by their followers as legitimate brokers of peace in any dialogue process, there are chances that the government will set a new course towards stability in the troubled Southern Cameroon.\n\nCho said, \u201cLet me use this opportunity to appeal to the Federal Government to please respect the March 1, 2019 decision of a Federal High Court in Abuja and immediately return the AUN Vice-President, Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, and his colleagues to their families and students.\n\n\u201cOn this sombre anniversary, we demand that the Nigerian government implements the judgment. The decision of the court, if obeyed, could kick-start a national reconciliation process and help resolve the raging conflict in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary of the ASCRN, Eric Febsar, called on human rights supporters worldwide to take action to demand the immediate rectification of what he described as \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d in the case of the 10 Ambazonian leaders.\n\nHe said such redress would help to mitigate the brewing humanitarian crisis posed by the influx of asylum-seeking Ambazonians into Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPresently, there are over 70,000 Cameroonian refugees registered with the UNCHR in Nigeria, and tens of thousands more are been pushed across the border in Cross River, Taraba, Benue and Adamawa states by the raging conflict in the English-speaking regions,\u201d Febsar added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nThe Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu has said that the Buhari administration was worried about power generation hovering around 5,000MW.\n\nHe said efforts were on to increase it to 7,000MW, then 11,000 MW before finally reaching 25,000MW in a few years time.\n\nAccording to him, the 215MW Kudenda power station in the Chikun local government area of Kaduna state, which has reached 80% completion, will be completed soon.\n\nHe noted that the turbine power station, which was designed to use both gas and diesel, was initiated by late President Umaru Yar\u2019 Adua but started by former President Goodluck Jonathan only to be abandoned by that government in the twilight of its administration despite nearing completion.\n\nSpeaking during an inspection tour of the facility in the company of Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna state on Tuesday, the Minister said the \u201cpresent administration is worried about the power generation hovering around 5,000MW, and efforts are in top gear to quickly increase it to 7,000MW, then 11,000 MW before finally reaching 25,000MW in a few years time\u201d.\n\nThe Minister said the major challenge faced by electricity in Nigeria is the poor transmission of power generated, adding that the government is doing everything possible to harvest the generated power, transmit them and generally improve electricity supply across the country.\n\n\u201cThis power station project started in 2012 and it has reached over 80% completion before work stalled, now we are trying to revive it. There are four partners and we are discussing with them to see how we can complete the project and bring it on stream. It would be powered by diesel first before the supply of gas because it uses a dual source of power.\n\n\u201cThis year is the year of delivery, the present situation we are in is not good enough, we have to improve. The power generated has been 5,000MW for a long time, it would be going down without investment which is why we are having system collapse, we had 15 or 16 years back, last year it was only two system collapse.\n\n\u201cWithin six months, you will see the electricity of this country improve. The Siemens which is an agreement struck between Nigeria and Germany will come on stream, there are 10 massive transformers to be deployed all around the country in specific locations. We also deployed 175 mobile substations some greenfield, some brownfield, which are going to construct.\n\n\u201cThis is 215MW, we have lots of them; Gurara Dam with 30MW, Zungeru with 700MW, Kashimbila has given 40MW to the grid, Dadinkowa also 40MW. We will increase energy. I was in Katsina on new year day January 1 to inspect the windmill which will produce 10MW and a 330KVA transmission line to Kano.\u201d He said.\n\nHe observed that many of the power facilities were allowed to become moribund, and assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration will do everything possible to bring them back to life and ensure that stable electricity without power outages reaches every household.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

ADEOLA OGUNLADE reports.\n\nThe two-day event at the International Forum for Peace and Security in Africa held at the Abdou Diouf International Conference Centre, Dakar, Senegal had in attendance prominent African leaders, diplomats, development experts, civilians, military experts, journalists and other delegates around the world. Tagged: Challenges of Africa\u2019s stability and emergence in a post-COVID world, the forum focused on peace and security. The 7th edition buttressed the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on peace and security and post-COVID recovery.\n\nAmong the participants are Senegalese President Macky Sall, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum and Guinea Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo. Also at the conference are the President of the European Council, Mr Charles Michel, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Mr Moussa Faki Mahamat and the Minister of the Armed Forces of the French Republic, Florence Parley.\n\nSall said Africa must be resilient to combat the adverse effects of a dual health and economic crisis, climate change, the intensification of terrorist attacks and the resurgence of coups d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\nHe noted that since 2014, the Dakar Forum has been held to diagnose the situation in Africa in order to contribute to the search for solutions to the ills affecting it.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThis is why African leaders, senior officials, civilian and military experts are participating in this forum today, as safeguarding the continent\u2019s peace and security is our mutual primary responsibility.\n\n\u201cSecurity has no price. But it does have a cost. Faced with the rise of the terrorist threat, we need greater budgetary flexibility to enable our countries to provide themselves with the means to ensure a minimum of national defence, with well-trained and well-equipped armies.\n\n\u201cWe must also question the doctrine of peace operations in Africa. There are seven of them on the continent today: six deployed by the United Nations and one by the African Union in Somalia (AMISOM), which alone has more than 21,000 troops; the seven operations total more than 75,000 soldiers,\u201d he said.\n\nSall added that national responsibility, international solidarity and collective security mean that peace and security in Africa are integral to world peace and security.\n\n\u201cWe must, therefore, continue to identify the internal and external causes of conflicts on the continent and assess the effectiveness of national responses, peace operations and other mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of disputes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called for a rethink of global economic governance to favour the conditions for financing Africa\u2019s emergence.\n\nHe called for reforms which should focus on relaxing rules for export credit loans, and lengthen maturity dates for financing development infrastructure projects.\n\nAccording to Ramaphosa, when the scientists in South Africa discovered the new COVID-19 variants- Omicron, immediately alerted the world but the punishment it got was a travel ban.\n\nHe called for the review of the intellectual right by world power for African countries to be able to manufacture vaccines.\n\nHe noted that the greed displayed by world powers is disappointing.\n\nInsecurity in the Sahel\n\nBazoum said terrorism at work in the Sahel today is characterised by forms of organisation that are very similar to those observed in the guerrilla movements in Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\u201cWhen I read the intelligence files on the organisation of these movements, I find a description of reality that reminds me of my reading of R\u00e9gis Debray and Che Guevara. The terrorist bases are indeed organised on the model of the focos, as described by R\u00e9gis Debray. This model, as you will recall, was not used in the wars of the national liberation movements in Africa, nor in the guerrilla wars attempted in Cameroon, the DRC and Niger in the early 1960s. It is surprising, to say the least, that this pattern of warfare should reappear more than 50 years later,\u201d he said.\n\nHe posited that the Sahelian terrorist movements benefit from conditions of access to financial resources unheard of for a rebellion. For almost two decades, northern Mali has been a lawless area where a criminal economy has developed around trans-Saharan drug trafficking to Europe and Asia. Local terrorist organisations, branches of ALQAIDA and DAESH, are linked to this traffic, which provides them with money.\n\n\u201cThe presence of numerous gold deposits in the area has encouraged gold panning activities under their control, which also allows them to increase their financial capacities.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment, much of their money comes from extortion, large-scale cattle rustling and the taxes they systematically impose on all the people in the vast areas they travel through on their motorbikes. Since the widespread use of these taxes and cattle rustling, vocations have increased and the number of young pastoralists joining the terrorist groups is growing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called on the Sahelian states to set up a military strategy adapted to the challenges, consisting of the use of techniques and means to make war the least asymmetric possible. This is what Niger is trying to do, he said.\n\n\u201cThey also need more appropriate support from their partners, focusing on intelligence, air support and capacity building for their armies. On the subject of intelligence, the major mistake of the partners is their weak involvement in the fight against arms trafficking from Libya, which is the most important parameter in the prevalence of this terrorism,\u201d Bazoum said.\n\nHe stressed that the Sahelian countries need exceptional financial resources, access to which requires a deviation from the traditional financing rules established by the international financial institutions, without which their action will always be very inadequate.\n\nRole of the international communities\n\nThe European Union Special Representative for the Sahel, Emanuela Del Re, said: \u201cThe growing insecurity is the core of the problem of the Sahel of which I am responsible somehow because I am representing 27 countries of the European Union (EU). This means that I represent the EU in cooperation with the Sahel Countries. We try to move the step forward for peace and above all stability within the Sahel countries.\u201d\n\nDel Re said the EU has developed its latest strategy for the Sahel which was defined in April last year and it was mainly on the issues of how to solve the problem of security and development together because the two must go together.\n\nRe said: \u201cThe key issue here is governance. We have a lot of experience in this region because we are the main partners with the Sahel countries. We are aware of the problems and as well the opportunities that come from focusing on governance.\n\n\u201cGovernance is important because we have come to the conclusion that unless we have a solid welfare state and institutions that can resist attack and solve problems in remote areas, especially when small communities are victims of attacks. Unless we put in place governance and a welfare state, we cannot in any way succeed. This is the real solution for stable society, resilient society and the promotion of peace intending as a way of creating stability within the countries.\n\n\u201cThe Sahel is most important on the table of the EU. We believe that whatever happens in the Sahel has an impact on our society as well as the rest of Africa. In terms of military response to the problem of security, we have a training mission in Mali where Soldiers are being trained. We are investing a lot in military equipment, providing technical assistance, and training of the Police Force. There is a huge intense activity to fight terrorism under different point of view because we have integrated approach which is multi-dimensional and therefore, we don\u2019t leave anything out. That is why we focus on civil society groups and research. Unless we start thinking of how to solve the problem of terrorism by acting on different front, we might win the battle but what we want to win is the war and obtains peace.\u201d\n\nThe State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, Suzuki Takako, said Japan has been supporting Africa\u2019s positive efforts to maintain and strengthen its peace and stability through TICAD, which is an inclusive platform that advances African ownership and international partnership.\n\n\u201cNAPSA, a New Approach for Peace and Stability in Africa that we introduced in the last forum, is one example.\n\n\u201cJapan has been promoting some specific projects under NAPSA, such as human resource development in the field of criminal justice for West African countries including the G5 Sahel, border control capacity enhancement to strengthen counterterrorist measures, and capacity building for PKO personnel in African countries through assistance for PKO training centres and the UN Triangular Partnership Project,\u201d he said.\n\nTakako added: \u201cIn response to the spread of the COVID-19, we will continue to implement measures to support African health systems in the medium and long term. The COVID-19 epidemic has had a tremendous impact on African economies and societies, and has highlighted a variety of development challenges. In order for Africa to build back better and enjoy prosperity, it is important to ensure regional peace and stability as a prerequisite. To achieve 2 this, employment and educational opportunities are also necessary to prevent young people from being inclined toward violent extremism. Japan is promoting NAPSA, which addresses such root causes of conflicts and terrorism.\n\nECOWAS commitment toward the fight against insecurity\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama said the Economic Community of West Africa State (ECOWAS) has set up a $1billion Peace and Security Fund.\n\n\u201cThis fund was set up because we realise there is so much reliance on our international partners and their intervention is not sufficient enough to address some of the security challenges facing our sub-region and Nigeria is one of the first countries to contribute to the fund. We also put forward one of the ECOWAS committees, the idea of the ECOWAS force. Nigeria believes strongly in that idea of collective security. It is very much our policy. We are aware Nigeria is very active and present in a number of ECOWAS member\u2019s states over the years in the area of security and we always believe that it should be done collectively,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nThe Director of Policy at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Maj.-Gen. Usman Abdulmumuni Yusuf, said the Armed Forces of Nigeria in collaboration with some West African countries were doing so much to contain insurgency.\n\nHe lauded their efforts so far, stating that the dynamics keep changing because of the ability of the insurgents to recruit from outside the borders and with different sources of financing which has kept them afloat.\n\nGen. Yusuf noted that Federal Government was doing a lot to curb the major financial sources of the terrorist groups, while the Armed Forces in collaboration with other security agencies were working along the borders to militate against the importation of other fighters from other countries into Nigeria.",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday accused some Ogoni leaders of insincerity in the struggle for a better living standard.\n\nSuch leaders, the governor said, promote disunity among themselves, only to blame the backwardness of Ogoni land on others.\n\nWike spoke at the 30th anniversary of Ogoni Day with the theme: \u201cLeaving no one behind\u201d, which held in Khana Local Government Area yesterday.\n\nAccording to the governor, many Ogoni leaders cannot truly defend the interest of Ogoniland and genuinely pursue issues of environmental degradation and resource control with the same zest demonstrated by their forebears like the late Ken Saro-Wiwa, without selling out.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople like Ken Saro-Wiwa and all of the people you\u2019re celebrating on Ogoni Day \u2013 how many of you can today stand for what Ken (Saro-Wiwa) stood for? How many can today stand for the great Ogoni men who died for your struggle?\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWike regretted that some Ogoni people debased the struggle and used it to collect money from those kicking against the goals of the struggle.\n\nHe said such monetary gratification could best be described as blood money and wondered the conscience they garnered each year to celebrate a struggle they betrayed.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou use Ogoni Day to make money. God will never forgive you. I will never be a party to make blood money. All of you here today for Ogoni Day, are you standing firm for Ogoni people? Are you standing firm for the spirit of those who died for you? Go and check your conscience. Ogoni people, check your conscience.\u201d\n\nThe governor insisted that he had never betrayed Rivers\u2019 interest, but defended it with courage, including pursuing the OML 11 law suit at the Supreme Court.\n\nHe observed that the case might not be concluded before the end of his tenure, but he might secure the most needed ownership right of such resources to the people.\n\n\u201cYou people are talking about OML 11. Today, I\u2019m in Supreme Court to challenge the Federal Government and NNPC. I will not be governor forever; I\u2019m leaving next year, but God in heaven will bear me witness that I have protected, defended the interest of the state and interest of Ogoni land.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged Ogoni leaders and the people to refrain from being used as agents of discord by the Federal Government and its agencies to pull down their own and betray the common interest.\n\nHe noted that some Ogoni people have been used to frustrate the political career and one of their bright brains \u2013 Senator Magnus Abe and Ledum Mitee \u2013 to becoming Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs).\n\nThe governor also noted that the same lack of unity seen in Ogoni land was prevalent in the entire Niger Delta because governors in the region, lawmakers and other leaders were hardly working together.\n\nHe said the people of Niger Delta were the ones marginalising themselves because each tribe thought itself as more Niger Deltan than the other.\n\nChairman of the occasion and President, Ijaw National Congress (INC), Prof. Benjamin Okaba, traced Nigeria\u2019s fundamental problem to the refusal of the Federal Government to restore the derivation principle that was abrogated by Decree NO.34 of May 1966 by Aguiyi Ironsi.\n\nHe named others as the subsequent promulgation of Petroleum Decree 1966 and General Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s 1978 Land Use Act, considered widely as the most obnoxious, draconian and unjust piece of legislation on land and resource ownership.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act 2021 that is laced with several contentious and discriminating clauses against the people of the Niger Delta is yet another dimension of institutional injustice against the oil and gas host communities of the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cChief Obasanjo, who is unarguably widely travelled, \u2026 will admit that in the United States (U.S), which presidential system Nigeria borrowed from, it is the states where oil is found that own them and not the Federal Government of America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason states like Texas is very rich, from proceeds of oil and gas. Same goes for Canada. In every federation, the undiluted application of the fundamental of federalism (including fiscal federalism), are the minimum prerequisites for sustainable unity, peace and coexistence.\n\n\u201cWhere else among the nations that practice federalism that permits the Federal Government to hijack the resources from the various federating units and communities, siphon them to the Centre on the Emperor\u2019s laps, and shares same as booties in the manner we have in Nigeria?\u201d\n\nThe former President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Ledum Mitee, recalled how he and other Ogoni leaders gathered at the same venue 30 years ago to commence the Ogoni struggle that had since been recognised globally.\n\nHe appealed to the Federal Government to extend rail line to Ogoni, which had contributed immensely to the development of the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nSenator Barry Mpigi commended the governor for gracing the occasion and identifying with the Ogoni people and their struggle.",

          "text": "The Federal Government is set to gazette the court order classifying bandits as terrorists, it was learnt yesterday.\n\nThe November 26, 2021 judgment by Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja has also become a critical factor in the deployment of Super Tucano aircraft in the fight against terrorists, kidnappers and bandits.\n\nAlso, the Attorney-General; and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said President Muhammadu Buhari would be guided by public interest while considering the request to release the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nMalami spoke on the gazette and the request for Kanu\u2019s release on the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) \u2018Good Morning Nigeria\u2019 show.\n\nOn the process of gazetting the order declaring bandits as terrorists, he said: \u201cThe gazetting of a court order or judgement is a process, but what matters fundamentally within the context of international convention is the judicial declaration and that has been obtained; the court has declared bandits, kidnappers, cattle rustlers as terrorists.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cSo, with or without the gazette, what gives effect to such a declaration is a judicial pronouncement but the gazette is a mere formality and it has been on and I believe within a matter of days, it will be concluded.\u201d\n\nThe minister said government acted promptly in declaring IPOB and Boko Haram as terror groups because of the \u201cthreats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation.\u201d\n\nHe stressed: \u201cGovernment has a responsibility to act, but within the context of acting, you are equally expected to operate within the confines of international best practices associated with engagement.\n\n\u201cOne of such best practices is that you can only use maximum force on groups or individuals that are declared terrorists and that is where the application of the Terrorism Act comes in place.\n\nRead Also: Declaring bandits as terrorists\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, Nigeria acted, first by proscribing IPOB, taking into consideration the threats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation. Boko Haram was also proscribed.\u201d\n\nThe AGF said the outcome of IPOB and Boko Haram\u2019s proscription encouraged government to consider the decision to deploy military hardware against bandits.\n\nMalami said: \u201cNow, we are confronted with another threat in the North-west associated with banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and in all these, these people are using weapons to attack Nigerians, kidnap them and created a situation of serious security challenge and fear in the system.\n\n\u201cWhatever military hardware you acquire, there are limits within the context of the international convention as to how it can be used, when it can be used and against who it can be used. And that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers come into being.\n\n\u201cOur assessment, taking into consideration that they are causing a major threat to the territorial peaceful co-existence and causing a major threat to lives with weapons, the idea then came about that indeed, they (bandits) have satisfied the criteria of being declared terrorists within the context of the law so that whatever military hardware are at the disposal of the Federal Government can best be used against them within the context of the international convention and within the context of the law.\u201d\n\nOn whether the military can now deploy the Super Tucano aircraft against the bandits, Malami said: \u201cI can tell you that the international convention demands associated with the usage of Super Tucano has been obtained, which is a judicial pronouncement and declaration of bandits, cattle rustlers and indeed, kidnappers as terrorists, and that has been procured and the way has now been cleared for the application, deployment and usage of Super Tucano. Whether they have been put to use or not, I cannot say.\u201d\n\nMalami said President Buhari will consider the interest of Nigerians before considering the request to release Kanu.\n\nSome Igbo elders, led by First Republic Minister of Aviation Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, had visited the President and requested Kanu\u2019s unconditional release on November 19, last year.\n\nThe President told them while he would not want to interfere in the judicial process in relation to the Kanu case, he would consider their demand though it is \u201ca heavy one.\u201d\n\nOn November 10, 2021, Malami had hinted that the government would not rule out political solution while addressing the cases of Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho), adding that pleas by credible individuals and groups cannot be ignored.\n\nMalami said yesterday: \u201cBy way of general statements to the two issues presented \u2013 the issue relating to Electoral Bill and the issue relating to Kanu and by extension, IPOB, what I can tell you for certain is that the decision of the President is based fundamentally and at all times on public interest consideration.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn the art of governance and what I have come to learn about the mind and heart of the President, Muhammadu Buhari, is to consider the 200 million Nigerians as against the limited people.\n\n\u201cBy extension, the issue of Kanu, what would as well govern the decision of the President in terms of whatever request is presented is the public interest as against limited sectional interest of it.\u201d",

          "text": "By Christopher Oji\n\nResidents of Magodo Phase 2 Estate in Lagos State, yesterday, took to the street to protest against the presence of about 50 policemen at the gate.\n\nThis was after the estate\u2019s management had ordered the closure of the gates in protest against the planned demolition of property within the estate.\n\nThere has been crisis between the police and the management/inhabitants of the estate, as residents accused the police of intimidation to the extent that the estate\u2019s security guards prevented the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, from entering the estate for a social visit, prompting the commissioner to order the arrest of the guards.\n\nHowever, the board of trustees of the estate has apologized to Odumosu over the misdemeanor of the guards who barred him from entering the estate.\n\nIn the apology, Engr. Ayoola Lawson said on behalf of the security guards and the residents\u2019 association: \u201cI tender unreserved apologies for the improper conduct of our estate on the 1st of January 2022, at the estate gate entrance. The conduct of the security men is highly regretted.\u201d\n\nDuring yesterday\u2019s protest, policemen were said to have recently accompanied suspected land-grabbers and members of a particular family who besieged the estate to claim possession of property.\n\nDuring the visit, the group used red, brown and blue inks to inscribe \u201cID/795/88 Possession Taken Today 21/12/21 by Court Order,\u201d on various properties on the estate.\n\nThe family were said to have led the group and armed policemen to the estate to execute a Supreme Court judgement.\n\nThe group was about to enter the estate with a bulldozer when the estate management ordered the closure of the gate.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIt was learnt that it took the intervention of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu before the gates were reopened as the Inspector-General of Police, Baba Usman, promised to withdraw the policemen.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, the chairman of the estate, Bajo Osinubi, said the policemen had remained in the estate despite Sanwo-Olu\u2019s intervention, adding that residents had been living in fear as the policemen moved around with their weapons.\n\nHe said, \u201cMore than 50 armed policemen are still around and they are restless and didn\u2019t go for Christmas and New Year. In the morning and evening, they carry their guns around and you can imagine what will happen if there is a disagreement between the group and residents and somebody.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Government has described the takeover plot as unwarranted and vowed to prosecute those involved in the invasion.\n\nAlso, the legal adviser of the Magodo Residents\u2019 Association, Tunji Abdulhameed, while countering the purported Supreme Court judgment behind the actions of the claimants, said there was no specification to the area, property and location of the plots of land in the judgment they got in 1993.\n\nHe averred that, \u201cFor you to execute even when you get a judgment, you must still apply for a writ of possession and, without it, you cannot enforce the judgment. So, when they applied for the writ of possession and it was approved, we challenged it and that was the time the residents\u2019 association joined the case as we were not part of the case before they got the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the closure of the gate was to create awareness to the public and to draw the attention of the government as to what is happening in Magodo so that we can get protection from them.\u201d",

We believe that, by coming on a quarterly basis to supervise them, we would ensure that before the end of this year, we will see the trains on top of the tracks. That is our commitment and we will begin to monitor and check ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt is a very iconic and landmark project that we are truly proud of. On behalf of the government, I want to commend all of our contractors because they are very committed. They have assured us that whatever it takes, they will complete all of the projects on schedule and on budget,\u201d the governor said.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, who was accompanied by some of his cabinet members and heads of agencies, said the inspection tour to the blue and red line rail project stations was in regards to the promise made by his administration to monitor the pace of works in the areas on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe governor, who promised to intensify supervision and monitoring of the projects quarterly to facilitate speedy completion, also commended the contractors for keeping up with the timeline at the stations visited, considering improvements at the sites of the projects.\n\n\u201cWe embarked on this similar tour about three or four months ago and we did mention that we would be doing it every quarter so that we can see how far the constructions are going. As we all have seen, I am happy to report that the construction is going on according to schedule.

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nInter\u2013Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has commended the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to withhold assent to the amended Electoral Act Bill due to the inclusion of compulsory direct primary for political parties.\n\nIPAC said the president was right in rejecting the bill, stressing that at this stage of democratic journey, Nigeria does not appear to be sufficiently ripe and prepared for the direct primary model in the selection of political party standard bearers.\n\nIPAC National Chairman, Yabagi Yusuf Sani, told newsmen at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, that the decision of the president was taken in the interest of Nigerians, even though many refused to admit.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPAC is impressed with the lawmakers for the courage, commitment and patriotism exhibited in the passage of a bill that was widely applauded as groundbreaking and transformative in the annals of the nation\u2019s legislative chambers.\n\n\u201cLawmakers, this time, disregarded partisan differences in favour of superior national interest, and stood in a spirited battle in the course of democracy even in the face of intimidation and blackmail.\n\n\u201cThe only expressed grouse of the president was the mandatory use of direct primary in the selection of standard bearers of all the political parties. While many never concede to the explanations of security challenges with the other reasons given by the president, we won\u2019t disagree with him on the reason of complex logistics and huge financial burden that direct primary will imply for Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cMany have canvassed the view that no amount of money should be considered too high in the efforts to sanitise the nation\u2019s electoral process and that the legislature should therefore, invoke its veto powers to overrule the president. Such action may be tantamount to a wholesale wrecking of the boat. It will result in fruitless exercise if at the end of the day, its implementation was not supported by the required funding by the executive.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cLawmakers may have acted as interlopers by trying to run political parties from the hallowed chambers because, objectively in the context of international practices primary cannot be legislated upon, and are best left to the discretion of the political parties. It\u2019s an attempt to usurp the constitutional rights of parties as to the method of choice of party standard bearers.\u201d\n\nIPAC, thus, submitted that the way out of the logjam was for the shifting of grounds by all parties for a compromise and amicable resolution that would result in a win-win scenario.\n\n\u201cThis should not be a difficult task given that the two arms are, incidentally, controlled by the same political party, the All Progressives Congress. Lawmakers should simply expunge the clauses regarding direct primary, thereby, saving the other provisions among which are the one on the mandatory electronic transmission of election results by INEC. By that, we believe the president should have no further reason to withhold his assent.\u201d\n\nIPAC also raised concerns over the flagrant abuse of the constitution regarding defection from one political party to another.\n\n\u201cConstitutional provision stipulate that elected officials can only legally change from one party to another while in office if a clear case of divisions or fictionalisation is perceived to exist in the party on whose platform he or she rode to the office in the first instance.\n\n\u201cMost incidences of defections in recent times, have occurred without the obvious existence of such situations. We must know that frivolous and wilful cross carpeting only exists in a parliamentary democracy and not in a presidential system of democracy that is extant in Nigeria.\u201d",
          "summary": "From Fred Ezeh, AbujaInter\u2013Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has commended the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to withhold assent to the amended Electoral Act Bill due to the inclusion of compulsory direct primary for political parties.\nIPAC said the president was right in rejecting the bill, stressing that at this stage of democratic journey, Nigeria does not appear to be sufficiently ripe and prepared for the direct primary model in the selection of political party standard bearers.\n\u201cThe only expressed grouse of the president was the mandatory use of direct primary in the selection of standard bearers of all the political parties.\n\u201cThis should not be a difficult task given that the two arms are, incidentally, controlled by the same political party, the All Progressives Congress.\nLawmakers should simply expunge the clauses regarding direct primary, thereby, saving the other provisions among which are the one on the mandatory electronic transmission of election results by INEC.",

          "text": "\u2022Declare new king will be chosen based on tradition\n\n\u2022Oyo ex-AG advises Makinde against appointment of new Oba\n\n\u2022Jonathan, Sanwo-Olu, Anyim mourn late monarch\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe Olubadan-in-Council, yesterday, said there was no controversy over the emergence of a new Olubadan of Ibadanland, declaring that tradition would be followed in the choice of the next king.\n\nBut an Ibadan-based lawyer and former Attorney-General of the state and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Michael Lana, had earlier advised Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde against approving the appointment of any of the current High Chiefs and Baales as the new Olubadan because there were unsettled legal matters relating to the stool.\n\nMeanwhile, there were more eulogies to the departed monarch yesterday. Former President Goodluck Jonathan, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and former President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim, commiserated with the people of Ibadan and the family of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who passed away on Sunday at the age of 93.\n\nA statement released at the end of a two-hour closed-door meeting held at the residence of Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Lekan Balogun, said members of the council would meet and announce the next Olubadan in line with tradition after the mourning period for Oba Saliu Adetunji.\n\nCuriously, the Osi Olubadan, High Chief Rasheed Ladoja, and two other members of the council were absent at the meeting.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cFollowing the demise of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1, on Sunday, members of the Olubadan-in-Council on Monday condoled with the Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Oluseyi Makinde, the people of Ibadan land and family members of the late monarch.\n\n\u201cRising from a two-hour closed-door meeting held at the Alarere residence of Otun Olubadan and the would-be successor to the throne, Sen. Dr. Lekan Balogun, the Olubadan-in-Council described the deceased leader of the Council as an indefatigable ruler, whose reign would be difficult to forget.\n\n\u201cWhile praying for the repose of the soul of the departed king, the council urged the bereaved family of the deceased to remain joyous and happy for the legacies of good reign left behind by their patriarch.\n\n\u201cThe council reiterated that the historical and traditional succession plan to the throne of Olubadan remains sacrosanct, the elevation conferred on all the members of the Olubadan-in-Council as Royal Majesties notwithstanding.\n\n\u201cMembers of the council were elevated to the Royal Majesties status by the previous administration in the state led by the late Governor Abiola Ajimobi and it became contentious and litigatious.\n\n\u201cOlubadan-in-Council said the elevation granted the members, who also serve as kingmakers, had not in anyway altered the age-long and enviable traditional succession plan to the Olubadan throne in Ibadan land.\n\n\u201cThere should be no controversy as to who becomes the next Olubadan amongst us as the previous elevation that made us Royal Majesties did not in anyway affect our respective offices in the Olubadan-in-Council and would not preclude any of us to mount the Olubadan throne whenever it is the person\u2019s turn.\n\n\u201cWe are the kingmakers and we will do the needful at the appropriate time. For now, we are still all in the mourning mood of our departed father and revered leader in the Council and we just want to assure the generality of our people both home and in the diaspora that there\u2019s no cause for alarm.\u201d\n\nBut Lana, in a letter to Makinde and which was copied to the Oyo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, claimed that approving the appointment of any of the High Chiefs and Baales would amount to an illegality, and would, therefore, be null and void.\n\nIn the letter dated January 3, Lana claimed that the Chieftaincy Declaration of 1957, which has not been set aside, forbade the elevation of an Oba to the position of Olubadan.\n\nThe seat of Olubadan became vacant on Saturday, January 1, 2022, following the death of His Royal Majesty, Oba llu Adetunji, Aje Ogunguniso 1, the Olubadan of Ibadanland.\n\nLana, in his letter to the governor, advised that the governor should withhold his approval of any of the High Chiefs or Baales as Olubadan to avoid involvement in the desecration of Ibadan Customary Chieftaincy Law.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, Makinde\u2019s predecessor had violated the Chieftaincy Law, when he, \u201cWithout thinking the legal effects of his actions on the future of Ibadan traditional institution, conferred the title of Obaship on some High Chiefs and Baales and gave them the right to wear beaded Crowns and coronets, in 2017.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the action of the former governor was challenged up to the Court of Appeal before the matter was resolved out of court.\n\nLana stated in the letter to Makinde, \u201cUpon Your Excellency\u2019s assumption of office, it was resolved that the matter be settled amicably and same was settled through the instrumentality of a Terms of Settlement, which became the judgement of the Court.\n\n\u201cThe said Terms of Settlement recognised the Illegality of the said actions and, therefore, set aside the Gazettes by which the said Chiefs became Obas with a right to wear beaded Crowns and coronets.\n\n\u201cThese High Chiefs and Baales were dissatisfied with this Consent Judgement and, therefore, instituted two separate suits to set aside the Consent Judgement while at the same time clinging to the title of Obas (which actually is in contempt of court).\u201d\n\nLana further pointed out that in committing this alleged aberration, which changed the Ibadan Chieftaincy customary law, the Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration of 1957 was not amended and, therefore, remained extant.\n\nHe said, \u201cUnder that Declaration and all relevant laws, no Oba can ascend to the throne of Olubadan. In other words, as long as the High Chiefs still cling to the title of Oba, they cannot ascend to that throne and any installation of any of them during the pendency of that suit, is illegal, null and void.\u201d\n\nHe said in the entire history of Ibadanland, appointment of the Olubadan had never been an issue; hence, the governor should not do anything to make it so.\n\nAccording to Lana, \u201cIt is in line with this legal situation that I advise, most humbly, that you should withhold any approval of any High Chief to become the Olubadan so that you will not also join in the desecration of Ibadan Chieftaincy Customary law.\n\n\u201cThere are only two ways to deal with this situation: one is for the High Chiefs to withdraw the aforementioned cases and the other is to wait for the court to pronounce on it before any step is taken to install an Olubadan. If the court holds that they have the right to be Obas and entitled to wear beaded crowns, then they are perpetually barred from becoming another Oba.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the customary law of any Yoruba town is an Oba elevated to become another Oba. If, on the other hand, the court holds that the Terms of Settlement stands, and their obaship title is illegal, then they are free to be elevated to the post of Olubadan. The ball, your Excellency, is in their court.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Jonathan, while commiserating with the government and people of Oyo State, expressed sadness over the exit of the monarch, describing him as a renowned leader and king, who had the interest of his people at heart.\n\nHe said in a condolence message, \u201cOlubadan was a compassionate and sagacious traditional ruler, who served as a worthy custodian of the custom and culture of his people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jonathan, the late monarch will continue to \u201cbe remembered for the way he channelled his wisdom and energy towards the growth and development of Ibadanland, serving as a sage and moral compass in his domain.\u201d\n\nThe former president noted that the late Olubadan would be missed, not only in Ibadanland, but across the country, because of his significant contributions to the growth of the society.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in his condolence message, said the late traditional ruler\u2019s service to the people of Ibadanland, Oyo State, and Nigeria as a whole, would remain his enduring legacy.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in the message issued yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, described Oba Adetunji\u2019s death as a great loss to the people of Ibadan and the traditional institution in Oyo State.\n\nThe governor urged the family, friends, and associates of the deceased as well as the entire people of Ibadan, whose interests the late monarch represented and worked tirelessly to protect during his lifetime, to work towards immortalising him.\n\nSanwo-Olu said in the message, \u201cOn behalf of the government and people of Lagos, I commiserate with my brother, the Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, and the people of the ancient city of Ibadan, the deceased family, friends and associates on the transition of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who joined his forebears yesterday (January 1).\n\n\u201cThe death of Oba Adetunji is a great loss to the people of Ibadan and he will be greatly missed. He made lots of positive impact during his lifetime, contributing meaningfully to the growth and development of Ibadan, Oyo State, and Nigeria at large as a philanthropist, foremost music promoter, and, later, as a traditional ruler.\n\n\u201cOba Adetunji, as a first class traditional ruler, left a lasting legacy that the people of Ibadanland will continue to cherish. I pray that Almighty God be pleased with the soul of the late monarch and grant the royal family and the people of Ibadan the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\u201d\n\nAnyim, on his part, said Oba Adetunji was a patriotic Nigerian, who was deeply committed to the peace, unity and development of the country.\n\nAnyim worded his commiseration, thus, \u201cI have received with sadness, news of the death of our highly respected traditional ruler, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadan. Let me convey to your Excellency, the family of His Royal Majesty, and the good people of Ibadan, my deepest condolences on this sad event.\n\n\u201cLate Oba Adetunji was a patriotic Nigerian, who was deeply committed to the peace, unity and development of our country. His nearly six years on the throne brought peace and great development to his kingdom and the entire Oyo State.\n\n\u201cHis demise will be greatly felt, as Oyo State and the country at large would miss his invaluable advice and wise counsel as the nation searches for solutions to her many challenges. I pray that the Lord will comfort his family and grant his soul eternal rest in His bosom.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He was buried in-between the graves of his parents at the Hajj Camp cemetery in Kano metropolis. He was aged 74 years.\n\nThe Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, and former governor of Kano State, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, were among prominent Nigerians that attended the funeral prayer.\n\nApart from the president, Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni were among those, who sent early tributes to the deceased.\n\nBuhari, while leading the nation in mourning Tofa, described him as a politician of note, who was also a promoter of Islamic culture and civilisation. The president described Tofa as a true nationalist that would be difficult to replace.\n\nThe president said regarding the former presidential candidate, \u201cHe was, till the end, a patriot to the core. He envisaged a better Nigeria for all. We pray that this dream and collective aspiration and necessary commitment will not go with him. We owe it to his memory and to the nation.\u201d\n\nHe Allah to repose his soul and grant fortitude to the bereaved family and friends, the Kano Emirate Council, as well as the government and people of Kano State to bear the loss.\n\nBuhari recalled that Tofa set up the Bureau for Islamic Propagation (BIP) in the mid-80s that helped to unite Muslim scholars in the northern states, narrowing the differences that characterised their relationships. The BIP also published books and newspapers.\n\nIn addition to his tributes, the president sent a four-man delegation to Kano with a condolence letter to Ganduje. The team was made up of Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd), and Minister of Water Resources, Engineer Sulaiman Adamu. It was accompanied by Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), Garba Shehu, and Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris.\n\nIn a statement by the Kano State Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, and chief mourner, Ganduje recalled the sacrifices of Tofa, who started taking up leadership responsibilities at an early age, when he was elected councillor in Tofa community in his late 20s, and remained vibrant and dynamic up till the time of his death.\n\nHe said as a businessman, trader and philanthropist, Tofa touched the lives of many people, especially, the downtrodden, and expressed the belief that the legacies of the deceased would be approximated for posterity.\n\nGanduje stated in his tribute to Tofa,\n\n\u201cThe legacy of his political beliefs and triumphs will be important footnotes in the literature of Nigeria\u2019s government and politics for generations yet to come.\n\n\u201cHe was a great man, a quintessential democrat and outstanding statesman, who has left very lasting impressions both on the politics and political history of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe prayed the Almighty Allah to grant his soul Aljannah Firdausi and grant Tofa\u2019s family, friends, and associates the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nAtiku, in a press release by his media office in Abuja, described the late Tofa as a thoroughbred democrat, whose contributions to the growth of democratic governance in Nigeria is invaluable.\n\nThe former vice president noted that throughout his political career, Tofa was a politician, who believed in the power of ideas and ideologies and was never associated with political violence or any other anti-democratic behaviour.\n\nThe Waziri Adamawa was in touch with Tofa until his last days\n\nAtiku stressed that the statesman and politician, who had been preoccupied with the state of affairs in Nigeria in recent times, and, especially as it impacted the North, was a \u201cbalanced and incisive\u201d personality.\n\n\u201cHis style of politics and the panache with which he engaged political opponents will remain classical in Nigeria\u2019s political history and are worthy of emulation by contemporary political actors and the future generations,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nBuni, while describing Tofa as an iconic politician, said in a statement by his Director General, Press and Media Affairs, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, that Tofa was an iconic politician, who shared the values of politics as call to service.\n\n\u201cLate Tofa was a fine gentleman, a true democrat and a nationalist with a definition of politics as a tool for service delivery,\u201d Buni said, noting that Nigeria lost the late politician at a time the country\u2019s democracy needed his wise counsel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG Commences Collection of Income Tax on Bonds, Short-term Securities from Today",
          "text": "\u2022Stockbrokers express divergent view over new policy\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nThe federal government will today commence the collection of income tax on bonds, short-term securities.\n\nThis followed the expiration of a 2012 gazette which exempted Companies Income Tax (CIT) from bonds and short-term securities in the past 10 years.\n\nThe federal government had in 2012 granted tax waiver on all bonds and debt instruments issued by all tiers of government and corporate entities.\n\nBut the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had last month introduced a 0.025 per cent charge on fixed income (Bonds) secondary market transactions, which was expected to become effective today.\n\nThe capital market regulator had in a circular explained: \u201cIt will charge 0.025 per cent of the total value of all secondary market transactions on bonds, while the Securities Exchange on which the transaction occurs will charge an amount not exceeding 0.025 per cent of the total value of secondary market transactions on bonds while bond transactions by dealing members will attract a single regulatory fee of 0.0001per cent of the total value of the secondary market transactions on bonds, and are exempt from the 0.025per cent fee charge earlier stated.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, capital market operators which included the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS) and the Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON) have expressed support for the move by the federal government.\n\nPresident, Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), Mr Olatunde Amolegbe said the introduction of the policy by the apex capital regulator would bring significant regulation to the market.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe regulator\u2019s decision comes at significant cost which needs to be covered by the ultimate beneficiaries which are the investors. Therefore, there is no issue with the introduction of a regulatory charge on transactions.\n\n\u201cHowever, whether it should be as high as 0.02 per cent is open to discussion. We can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that such will definitely increase the net yield on instruments, reduce spreads and might impact trade volumes. I am sure the market ecosystem will ultimately arise at a point of equilibrium for all participants.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), Mr. Sam Onukwue said: \u201cI do not think it\u2019s out of place for the SEC to do so.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has been charging on equities all along. The proposed charges on fixed income securities should not discourage investors from the asset class.\n\n\u201cInvestors have their preferences and would always weigh their risk tolerance and other fundamentals in making investment decisions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cWe have risk-takers and risk averters. The former invest more in equity while the latter have a strong hold in fixed income securities.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, the President of the Association of Capital Market Academics (AMAN), Prof. Uche Uwaleke said the introduction of the fee would empower SEC to carry out effective regulation and enhance the capital market.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe charge is on transactions in the secondary segment of the bond market and it is very much in order as it is already in place in the secondary segment of the equities market.\n\n\u201cIt will financially empower the SEC to carry out effective regulation and development of the Nigerian capital market. Besides, 0.025per cent is not significant to the point of discouraging transactions in the bonds market.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, some market operators disagreed with the policy, arguing that it would discourage investors from federal government debt instruments.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the oldest trading stockbroker on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), Mr. Rasheed Yusuf noted that the new fee would hike the cost of transactions in the fixed income instruments.\n\n\u201cBoth the buyer and seller of fixed income instruments will have to pay the additional cost. Will it make prospective investors mull on the additional cost and conclude that the yield is no longer attractive? These are the things we will be looking out for.\n\n\u201cWe will need to find out if the additional cost is sufficient to discourage players in the fixed income market or it will bring about a marginal effect.\n\n\u201cHowever, it will be a function of the volume an investor is buying from the fixed income market.

In other countries, the government gives incentive to enable investment.\n\n\u201cWhat the government should have tax is consumption not on investment. When you tax investment, your destroying investment flow into the economy and indirectly injuring economy entities that should have provided employment and drive economy growth,\u201d he added.\n\nA Lagos-based analyst, Mr. Moses Ojo noted that the introduction of tax income on government securities would further reduce activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Against widespread belief that President Muhammadu Buhari was preparing to hand over power to a former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in May 2023 when his second term in office elapses, SaharaReporters has reliably gathered that the current occupier of Aso Rock Villa, Nigeria\u2019s seat of power, was already looking in another direction.\n\nPresident Buhari, it was reliably gathered, has in fact reached out to his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, on taking over power from him and was already working with some of his most trusted lieutenants to actualise this plan.\n\nBuhari and Jonathan\n\nA trusted source around the President told SaharaReporters that the idea had already received the backing of some prominent politicians from the North including state governors as the arrangement will enable power to return to the region in 2027 when Jonathan would have served out his single four-year term after previously occupying same position from 2011 to 2015.\n\nPresident Buhari and Jonathan had met last Thursday and according to the source, modalities of this new arrangement were discussed at length with further meetings to take place in the coming weeks to cement plans to help achieve the target.\n\n\u201cPressure came from two Northern governors for President Buhari to allow Jonathan to complete his term and return power to the North for another eight years beginning from 2027,\u201d the source revealed.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that Buhari had requested Jonathan to see him last Thursday following conclusion of discussion with the two governors, one of which is Mai Mala Buni of Yobe and APC Caretaker Committee Chairman.\n\n\u201cThis same Buni worked against Tinubu's interest in the electoral act to ensure Buhari did not sign it.\n\n\u201cTinubu had hoped to ward off challenge from Osinbajo, Rotimi Amaechi and others to get the APC presidential ticket through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cBuni is also working to organise national convention to create substantive national executives, all a ploy to ensure a Jonathan candidate.\n\n\u201cHe's masterminding a likely micro-zoning to the South-South to ensure Jonathan is the sole aspirant during the primary.\n\n\u201cFollowing the successful meeting on Thursday with Buhari, Jonathan has also moved swiftly to hold a strategic meeting with South-South ministers and will hold a national ministers' meeting under his government afterwards as a prequel to formal declaration.\n\n\u201cThe meeting which held under the South-South 2023 Presidency group headed by Jonathan's associate, Mr Dikivie Ikiogha, took place at Mrs Patience Jonathan's Aridolf Hotels and Spars.\n\n\u201cIf the plan goes well, Jonathan will choose a serving Northern governor as running mate. The most likely candidate for that will be Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nThe latest development will surely come as a huge blow to the aspirations of Tinubu, who has been desperate to become President of Nigeria since serving two terms as governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007.\n\nThe APC stalwart has been romancing President Buhari since helping him to defeat Jonathan in 2015, refusing to criticise his administration\u2019s failures in a desperate bid to have the latter hand over the reins to him during next year\u2019s election.\n\nHowever, top power brokers close to Buhari see the former Lagos governor as politically unpredictable and therefore have been working against his interest.\n\nBut to help push through his ambition, Tinubu and his men have created scores of groups to mobilise support to help make the dream a reality.\n\nFor instance, in October 2021, the South West Agenda for Asiwaju was formed in Lagos to help sell Tinubu as a viable candidate to every part of Nigeria.\n\nHeaded by a former Minister of State for Works, Dayo Adeyeye, SWAGA said emerging President of Nigeria in 2023 will be the best way to repay Tinubu for all his contributions to political development in the country.\n\nIn November 2021, another group, Patriots of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, was established in Abuja to further push the former Lagos governor\u2019s ambition of succeeding President Buhari in office in 2023.\n\nOn January 1, 2022, Director-General, Tinubu Support Groups Mgt. Council, Abdulmumin Jibrin, said the former Lagos governor will contest the 2023 election because he had more experience to run Nigeria than the others eyeing the position.\n\n\u201cThe issue of Bola Tinubu contesting is a done deal. He is going to contest the election; he\u2019s going to be on the ballot paper.\n\n\u201cThe person who has an edge over all of them, that we can hand over the ticket to and perhaps go back home and sleep, is Asiwaju Bola Tinubu,\u201d Jibrin said.\n\nIn December 2021, Tinubu disclosed that he would consult widely before making a decision on whether to run for the Presidency or not.\n\n\u201cI will effectively and widely consult, particularly brainstorm with my friends and find a date to come out openly and tell Nigerians,\u201d he had said at the time.\n\nLike Tinubu, there are dozens of other groups also currently drumming support for Osinbajo ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nAccording to one of such groups, The Progressive Project, the Vice President had all it required to effectively run Nigeria after Buhari leaves office next year.\n\nTPP\u2019s Director of Operations, Alhaji Usman A. Usman, said, \u201cWe made critical assessments far beyond mere partisan considerations and all rational indicators throw up the name of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as being most qualified and most adequately prepared to undertake such assignment.\u201d\n\nBut despite these ongoing efforts by loyalists of Tinubu and Osinbajo to market their principals, Buhari\u2019s new stance might have thrown both men under the wheel.\n\nThough Buhari\u2019s new choice \u2013 Jonathan \u2013 has continued to distance himself from talks of his return to Aso Rock Villa in 2023, events of recent times strongly supports the notion of him taking over from the incumbent \u2013 an outcome that greatly benefits Buhari\u2019s nepotistic agenda of returning power to the North in 2027.",

Usman, said, \u201cWe made critical assessments far beyond mere partisan considerations and all rational indicators throw up the name of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as being most qualified and most adequately prepared to undertake such assignment.\u201d\n\nBut despite these ongoing efforts by loyalists of Tinubu and Osinbajo to market their principals, Buhari\u2019s new stance might have thrown both men under the wheel.\n\nThough Buhari\u2019s new choice \u2013 Jonathan \u2013 has continued to distance himself from talks of his return to Aso Rock Villa in 2023, events of recent times strongly supports the notion of him taking over from the incumbent \u2013 an outcome that greatly benefits Buhari\u2019s nepotistic agenda of returning power to the North in 2027.",
          "summary": "\u201cPressure came from two Northern governors for President Buhari to allow Jonathan to complete his term and return power to the North for another eight years beginning from 2027,\u201d the source revealed.\nHowever, top power brokers close to Buhari see the former Lagos governor as politically unpredictable and therefore have been working against his interest.\nIn November 2021, another group, Patriots of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, was established in Abuja to further push the former Lagos governor\u2019s ambition of succeeding President Buhari in office in 2023.\nCouncil, Abdulmumin Jibrin, said the former Lagos governor will contest the 2023 election because he had more experience to run Nigeria than the others eyeing the position.\nLike Tinubu, there are dozens of other groups also currently drumming support for Osinbajo ahead of the 2023 election.",

          "text": "Abimbola Oyewole, identified as a chief superintendent of police (CSP), on Tuesday, defied Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, during the latter\u2019s visit to Magodo estate to intervene over a planned demolition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn earlier threat to demolish houses in the area on December 21 had been resisted by residents, and the police and bulldozers were withdrawn from the estate after the state intervened.\n\nAccording to the Lagos government, the case dates back to a demolition exercise at Shangisha village between 1984 and 1985, after which a supreme court verdict ordered the state to give the Shangisha landlords 549 plots of land as a \u201cmatter of first priority\u201d.\n\nThe state, however, said the supreme court verdict only relates to \u201callocation\u201d and not \u201cpossession\u201d of any land, adding that the Shangisha landlords cannot claim any land at Magodo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, residents had converged in front of the estate, and asked the state to intervene amid a renewed threat of demolition and police invasion.\n\nSanwo-Olu had later arrived at the estate with some government officials, including Moyosore Onigbanjo, the attorney-general of Lagos.\n\nOn arrival, the governor asked the CSP to explain his reasons for being at the estate without the knowledge of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a case between the supposed people and the Lagos state government. It has nothing to do with the residents here. Please, can you call your superior in Abuja and tell them the governor is here and I am the chief security officer and that you don\u2019t have any business being in my state and that I want you to disengage here?\u201d Sanwo-Olu told the CSP.\n\nResponding, Oyewole said: \u201cI\u2019m here on the instruction of the inspector-general of police, through the AGF, sir.

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10.

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Cars45, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi, here.\n\nIt seems 2020, the year of the coronavirus, is looking to become a trilogy. For the third year running, people are living through different levels of lockdowns and increasing cases of COVID-19 and its variants. On the last day of 2021, Israel reportedly recorded a double infection of influenza and coronavirus \u2014 Florona \u2014 in a pregnant patient.\n\nAlthough this is not a variant of the virus like Delta and Omicron, experts can\u2019t say how severe a combination of this kind could be. Some countries are still reconsidering lifting lockdowns, while others have experienced more than three waves of the pandemic already. I\u2019m tempted to ask, \u201cwhen does all this end?\u201d So, this is another reminder for you to stay safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a lot happened in the last year; apart from Crypto Explorer \u2014 Emmanuel mentioned this yesterday \u2014 there are some interesting topical discourses/series we introduced/re-introduced in 2021 that I want to remind you of (I promise, this has nothing to do with COVID-19). But, before that, let\u2019s do a quick one on what happened to a once-upon-a-time sweetheart of the smartphone industry.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nBlackberry\u2019s demise\n\nThe Expert series\n\nLiving with learning disabilities\n\nRIP Blackberry devices, for reals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 4, 2022, devices using the Blackberry OS will be unable to make or receive calls (including emergency numbers like 911), send or receive texts, use mobile data or Wi-Fi. However, this does not affect Blackberry devices running on Android OS.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. A steady decline in market acceptance has been noticed since 2013. The company stopped manufacturing its own phones in 2016 and began outsourcing to other hardware partner companies. In 2021, it gave prior notice about this discontinuation.\n\nNot exactly a complete death: Blackberry continues to run as a cybersecurity company. It pivoted to this enterprise in 2016. So, we could call this the end of an era.\n\nLooks familiar? Blackberry abandoning its mobile phone OS venture reminds me of the abrupt death of Windows phones in 2016 after running for six years. Half the time, experts predicted that it was bound to fail.\n\nSome quarters blamed the demise on the fact that Microsoft couldn\u2019t stand the market dominance of Google\u2019s Android OS and Apple\u2019s iOS. Others faulted its rigidity in adapting third-party apps, among other deficiencies.\n\nAlso, recall that Nokia and Motorola shared a similar fate, although the former was more shocking. Do you have a history with Blackberry? Please tell me about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2022 gets even better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we re-introduced The Experts series to our readers. It features the lives and exploits of African tech specialists across the world. So far, I\u2019ve picked the brains of the genius personality who, along with his team, built Interswitch\u2019s Quickteller, Wale Abba; talked to Rachael Akalia, one human that embodies the brand called Patricia Technologies, a Nigerian-founded Estonia-based alternative currencies startup.\n\nSubsequently, during a virtual chat, I got Mopewa Ogundipe to talk about her profession and journey to becoming the software engineer behind Clubhouse\u2019s long-awaited Android app; Nigerian-American, Abake Adenle also opened up about moving from a successful career in the UK\u2019s investment banking space to becoming an entrepreneur running a startup building a voice recognition and speech synthesis software for five African languages.\n\nThe last editions for 2021 featured famous music artist and tech investor, Mr Eazi, and the leader of open banking in Nigeria, Adedeji Olowe, who demystified the concept of open banking while talking about his life.\n\nAlong the line, Kudi\u2019s Product Manager, Nifemi Akinwamide, opened our eyes to what it looks like to navigate a learning disability to become successful.\n\nThis year, look out for new editions that promise to be even more exciting and instructive. Subscribe to get notified.\n\nHow much do you know about learning deficiencies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms like dyslexia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and dyscalculia are rarely discussed within the Africa context, even for people living with the conditions. In 2020, our reporter, Victoria Fakiya, did in-depth reflections on these disabilities and discussed assistive technologies that can make life easier for people living with them.

Yes, we\u2019re grateful for the respite of the public holiday, but you\u2019re probably working yourself into that mental space to resume work for the year.\n\nSince 2015, every New Year has seen Techpoint celebrate its birthday. On January 1, 2022, Techpoint turned 7, and we\u2019re entering the next frontier. Check out what that means in our Chief Servant, Muyiwa Matuluko\u2019s new year address.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Africa is 7! The next frontier\n\nWhat I\u2019m discussing\n\nA momentous 2021\n\nSignificant regulatory moves to watch closely\n\nIndustry trends for 2022\n\nA momentous 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was an incredible year for Africa\u2019s tech space in 2021, which saw five startups publicly disclose their valuations as unicorns. Led by Flutterwave in March 2021, OPay, Wave, Andela, and Chipper Cash joined the enviable ranks of companies worth over a billion dollars.\n\nThe acquisition of Funke-Opeke led MainOne by Equinix for $320 million remains one of the standout moments. Don\u2019t forget Nigeria\u2019s shocking 2021.\n\nWe did a roundup of the memorable moments of 2021. Check it out here.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the industry that stood out heads, shoulders, and knees above the pack was the fintech space. Nigerian fintechs, for example, raised almost $800 million in 2021, gulped up 76% of funding for the year.\n\nBut the real impact of fintech is not in the funding numbers, and in the last year, we saw some intriguing moves in agency banking, telco led mobile money, and e-transactions.\n\nGuided by the expert opinion of Adedeji Olowe, Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria, we reviewed Nigerian fintech in the year 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReviewing Nigerian fintech in 2021: Local investors are stepping up\n\nAre you interested in projections for the new year? Kindly keep reading.\n\nPolicies I\u2019m watching out for\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana debating e-payment levies\n\nOn December 21, 2021, Ghana\u2019s parliament turned into a legitimate battleground as lawmakers debated a proposal to introduce a 1.75% levy on all e-payment transactions. This would include mobile money transactions.\n\nThose in support are eyeing dividends of up to $1.15 billion that the country would gain in 2022 if its tax net widens to include e-payments.\n\nThose against the bill insist that it wouldn\u2019t be fair on low-income earners and people outside the formal banking sector, who heavily rely on mobile money.\n\nContext: In recent years, mobile money adoption in Ghana has been growing in leaps and bounds to rival Kenya\u2019s success story. A levy on mobile money transactions would improve taxation revenues, but there\u2019s no telling how it would impact the average mobile money user.\n\nThe parliament will meet on January 18, 2022, to cast the final votes, so that\u2019s a space worth watching.\n\nKenya signs law on digital lending\n\nWith banks reluctant to give loans, Africa has seen the rise of several digital lenders who have filled this gap. However, there\u2019s been a few controversies regarding unethical and predatory lending practices.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the Kenyan government has been implementing policies to stem these predatory practices. On December 7, 2021, the Kenyan parliament amended the Central Bank Act, 2021, giving the Central Bank of Kenya the authority to regulate digital credit lenders and limit unfair and discriminatory lending practices.\n\nGiven how vital lending is (more on that in a bit), I think this is a policy worth watching, and we can track important metrics like micro-lending activities. Read more.\n\nFunding Nigerian digital and creative companies\n\nThe African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a $170 million loan to fund the Nigerian Federal Government\u2019s i-DICE (investment in Digital and Creative Enterprises) program.\n\nThe government plans to use this initiative to fund 226 technology and creative startups and provide non-financial services to 451 digital technology and small and medium enterprises.\n\nNigeria\u2019s policy space has been fraught with lots of bad news, but I thought I should bring up what seems like good news.\n\nThe problem is, we\u2019ve seen several initiatives like this, and I\u2019ve been dismissive of them, but I think I should pay closer attention to announcements like these.\n\nYes, we\u2019ll look at past promises of such nature too, and if time permits, we can also include the one about lifting Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nThe CBN\n\nI\u2019m not saying the Central Bank of Nigeria is a policy to watch out for; I\u2019m simply saying we should pay them close attention. Whatever the apex bank decides tomorrow could heavily affect Nigeria\u2019s fintech space.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\nThankfully, the Nigerian Federal Executive Council has okayed the startup bill, and it has been sent to the National Assembly. If passed, this bill is touted as one of the most important legislation for Nigeria\u2019s tech space.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has a stellar history of passing great business laws, but implementing them has been another issue. Can we see a change in 2022? Does Nigeria need a startup act? Where are the clouds and silver linings?\n\nHere\u2019s my analysis on this subject. Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nSome projections for 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Internet is the lifeblood of the world\u2019s biggest companies today, so imagine my surprise in 2021 when I discovered the term Web3.\n\nThe Internet has evolved from different stages, with the original invention being called web 1, our current era is web2, and the future evolution will be Blockchain-powered Web3.\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s no industry trend without the Internet, so what happens to all the companies we know and appreciate if the Internet is changing? What does this evolution mean, and how does it affect me? We had some answers in the last crypto explorer of 2021.\n\nWeb3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond\n\nSurprise: Cloudfare says TIKTOK is now the most visited site in the world. Really? Not Google?\n\nWell, now is probably a good time to secure your child\u2019s online activities.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Web2? In 2021, several startups raised money to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector, undoubtedly the largest employer of labour on the continent and its most significant economic contributor.\n\nAs a result, these startups could experience closer scrutiny in 2022, with great expectations on their shoulders; it promises to be an exciting ride.\n\nAnother company that will be sure to make the headlines is Jumia. Long before the new wave of startups, Jumia dealt with African SMEs, and its struggles are well documented. Could we see a change in 2022?\n\nFintech ride: In 2021, Nigeria processed 3 billion electronic transactions valued at $588 billion. Source: I nor fit lie f\u2026 sorry.. NIBSS.\n\nI\u2019m making it one of my projects in 2022 to find out what all those transactions are. My best guess is cash, but is that the whole story?\n\nAlso, in 2021, Nigerian fintech, Piggyvest, said it disbursed $587.5 million to 3.5 million customers.\n\nMeanwhile, Olowe has again made some exciting predictions for Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\nSeveral predictions from last year, like WhatsApp\u2019s payment play and Visa and MasterCard\u2019s acquisition of Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively, have also featured in 2022.\n\nHighlights\n\nP2P FX to power investment apps\n\nNIN dethrones BVN\n\nTransfers become free.\n\nWe\u2019ll do a review this week, but you can check out his predictions here in the meantime\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nWishing you a Happy New Year!\n\nEmmanuel Paul for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "Nigeria seems to be playing fiddle in the fight against cervical cancer without an adequate capacity for primary prevention and palliative care, despite bearing the fourth worst burden of death from the disease after China, India and Indonesia.\n\nSome aspects of its layers of prevention, treatment and support care lack essential mechanisms that African peers such as Kenya and South Africa have hacked to get ahead of the disease, a new study published in the Journal of Cancer Policy shows.\n\nThe analysis, aimed at the content of policies for the prevention of cervical cancer in Africa, scored Nigeria two points on primary prevention, three on secondary and just one on tertiary prevention, a cumulative of six points.\n\nPrimary prevention activities work to reduce risk factors; through secondary prevention, precancerous cases are identified and managed, and tertiary activities focus on mitigating disability among those with the cancer.\n\nWeaknesses indicated in Nigeria\u2019s primary prevention programme include poor reduction of risk factors, which should otherwise involve widespread administration of vaccines against the human papillomavirus, with specific approaches for out-of-school girls through public health system or community-based campaigns.\n\nIn a country where about 12,075 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, the second most frequent cancer among women, the study shows that campaigns about risk factors for cervical cancer are inadequate.\n\nAlso apart from the routine treatment plan that covers pathology services, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, palliative care involving psychosocial, family and spiritual support has been a struggling aspect of Nigeria\u2019s tertiary prevention plan.\n\nRead also: Survivors mark WHO\u2019s first year of \u2018Cervical Cancer elimination movement\u2019 in Nigeria\n\n\u201cIt is, however, particularly important for cervical cancer policies to address tertiary prevention \u2013 especially in lower-income countries where many women with cervical cancer receive late-stage diagnoses due to lack of access to primary and secondary prevention programmes, and where cervical cancer survival is lowest,\u201d the report states.\n\nSouth Africa earned 11 points on the ranking with a lower death load at 5,600 and incidence rate of roughly 56 percent per 100,000, compared with Nigeria\u2019s 11.9 percent incidence rate.\n\nThis shows South Africa has double the strength of Nigeria in primary and tertiary prevention.\n\nThis is the same as Kenya, but a striking aspect about South Africa\u2019s fight is the widespread coverage it has going on among girls under its HPV vaccination programme.\n\nAs of 2020, 75 percent of girls turning 15 had received the first dose of HPV vaccine, while 61 percent were completely vaccinated, the World Health Organisation (WHO) countries\u2019 profiles of cervical cancer show.\n\nThe country has in-community or home-based care going on for palliative care with robust medical personnel per patient.\n\nAt least four in 10 women had been screened of cervical cancer as of 2019 compared with just one in 10 Nigerians in the same period.\n\nOne of the differences identified in the report is that policies from countries in Eastern and Southern Africa are more comprehensive than policies from other regions, especially those with above-average HIV prevalence such as Kenya, Malawi and South Africa.\n\nAlso, policy content may be influenced by donor priorities, as countries with more health financing from external sources have more comprehensive policies. Many cervical cancer prevention activities in low- and middle-income countries are donor-funded. HPV vaccines in some countries are for instance financed and supported through Gavi and generous support for screening activities through USAID and other partners.\n\nCertain policy components are more likely to appear than others, across types and countries. For example, it is more common to specify target vaccination and screening groups and relatively less common to discuss sensitisation campaigns or education about risk factors.\n\nHowever, the report also identifies that policy details are very mixed and are not always reflective of current evidence.\n\nFor example, the WHO strategy for cervical cancer elimination recommends twice-lifetime screening \u2013 ages 35 and 45. However, these policies vary widely in their recommendations around ages for cervical cancer screening; from beginning at age 20 \u2013 35 and stopping at age 45 \u2013 70.\n\nComprehensive and evidence-based policies are an essential step recommended toward improving population health outcomes \u2013 including for cancer control.",

Some even add a maternity side by side with the orphanage homes where they deliver people of babies and turn the place into a baby factory; they bring underage children to such homes to make babies and sell same, or traffic these children, as far as outside Nigeria, despite the restriction on international adoption.\u201d\n\nEdeko continued: \u201cOrphans are vulnerable persons; they are subject to all forms of exploitation; they are vulnerable to being trafficked, abused and sold. You will understand that the issue of human trafficking has been a very strong challenge globally and at the state level, Governor Godwin Obaseki has made serious efforts to stamp out human trafficking in Edo State.\n\n\u201cAs the ministry with the responsibility to investigate any adoption process, in line with the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda, we are committed to sanitizing the system and will be setting up a committee to audit orphanage homes in Edo State and come up with holistic policies on adoption and management of orphanage homes, in line with the child rights law. This is topmost on our agenda for the new year.\u201d\n\nShe further stated: \u201cThe government of Governor Obaseki is talking about institutional reforms and sectoral reforms. It then means we must reform every department that is within the purview of this ministry. So, we have continued to train and retrain the proprietors and proprietresses of these orphanage homes, and looking at these children today, I can see they are very beautiful; they are doing things that normal children will do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to do an audit and remove all those that came into this as a business. It is a charity and if you do not have the heart to do charity, you cannot be in the issue of managing orphanage homes. If you are here for the wrong reason, better take your leave. It is not going to work and we will put many of them behind bars and we will close the orphanages that are for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly those that are for true charity will be allowed to function, as there are standards for running orphanage homes in Edo State,\u201d the commissioner noted.\n\n...",

The brouhaha -particularly the gridlock at Isheri, this incident has caused is disturbing and highly condemnable.\n\n\u201cWe are also not unaware that the Nigeria police would not spare anyone who tries to disobey its protocol at the entry point of its facilities or anyone who resists its security personnel at the gate.\n\n\u201cIf the public are expected to cooperate with the police at any point in time, why would the police not respect other people\u2019s rules?\n\n\u201cWe invite the inspector-general of police to order an investigation into the misuse of privilege by the Lagos commissioner of police and further call on Lagos state governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\n\u201cAs the elected governor of state and chief security officer to apologize to o the affected victims of Mr. Odumosu\u2019s breach of public peace and violation of human rights.\u201d\n\nRecall that on Saturday, Odumosu, who was attending a social event at Magodo Brooks Estate, ordered the arrest of four security guards over their refusal to allow him entry into the estate.\n\nThe Lagos Police Commissioner Odumosu had also ordered the arrest of one Adebola Fatiregun, a female resident who is a widow, and her three children for intervening in the matter.\n\nAdekunle Ajisebutu, Lagos police spokesman, while reacting to the incident, said the CP visited the estate to meet a \u201cstrategic partner\u201d but was refused entry by some private security guards, even after being formally introduced.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018Brooks estate not locked down by Lagos CP\u2019, the police spokesperson said the CP did not lock down the estate as speculated on social media.\n\n\u201cCP Hakeem Odumosu who was recently promoted to the enviable rank of Assistant Inspector-General of Police due to his hard work and commitment to duty, visited the public Estate yesterday, January 1, 2022 to meet a strategic partner at a function after going round, visiting some places in the state to ensure the safety of Lagosians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police was accompanied by his armed security details and was driven in his official car bearing an official number plate and a pennant, including all the paraphernalia of office.\n\n\u201cOn reaching the Estate gate, he was properly introduced notwithstanding the visible security details in uniform including a dispatch rider in his convoy, yet he was prevented from entering the Estate by some overzealous private security guards.\n\n\u201cAll appeals to the security men to allow the CP to go to see someone at a function where an urgent matter bordering on security was to be discussed, fell on deaf ears even when they had foreknowledge of his coming.\n\n\u201cIn spite of this deliberate humiliation, the senior police officer remained calm. When it became obvious that the security men were going overboard, the CP after about 30 minutes humiliation, ordered the arrest of four of the security men, leaving one.\n\n\u201cHowever, in order not to make the Estate porous, the Commissioner of Police immediately posted well-armed policemen at the gate to support the security man left behind.\u201d\n\nHe accused residents of the estate of shutting down the estate.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Attorney and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, has said the President Muhammadu Buhari government is yet to officially designate bandits as terrorists because the government is following international best practices.\n\nMalami who spoke on Tuesday while appearing on Channels TV breakfast programme, \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 said his office was in the process of gazetting a court judgement that ordered the government to declare bandits as terrorists and that the process would be concluded in a matter of days.\n\nThe Buhari government had come under criticism for hastily declaring separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a terrorist group in 2017, while refusing to label bandits carrying out killings and kidnappings across the North.\n\nIn the case of IPOB, Malami was able to gazette the designation of IPOB as terrorists on the same day that Justice Abdu Kafarati gave the order on September 20, 2017.\n\nBut speaking on Tuesday, Malami said the government acted swiftly in declaring IPOB and Boko Haram as terror groups because of the \u201cthreats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cGovernment has a responsibility to act but within the context of acting, you equally expected to operate within the confines of international best practices associated with engagement and one of such best practices is that you can only use maximum force on groups, individuals that are declared terrorists and that is where the application of the Terrorism Act comes in place.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, Nigeria acted, first by proscribing IPOB, taking into consideration the threats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation. Boko Haram was proscribed.\u201d\n\nMalami claimed that the good results arising from outlawing IPOB and Boko Haram buoyed the government to consider the proscription of bandits, and the use of military hardware against them.\n\n\u201cNow, we are confronted with another threat in the North-West associated with banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and in all these, these people are using weapons to attack Nigerians, kidnap them and created a situation of serious security challenge and fear in the system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever military hardware you acquire there are limits within the context of the international convention as to how it can be used, when it can be used and against who it can be used. And that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers come into being.\n\n\u201cOur assessment taking into consideration that they are causing a major threat to the territorial peaceful co-existence and causing a major threat to lives with weapons, the idea then came about that indeed they (bandits) have satisfied the criteria of being declared terrorists within the context of the law so that whatever military hardware at the disposal of the Federal Government can best be used against them within the context of the international convention and within the context of the law.\u201d\n\nOn why his office has not gazetted the court order designating bandits as terrorists, Malami said, \u201cThe gazetting of a court order or judgement is a process but what matters fundamentally within the context of international convention is the judicial declaration and that has been obtained; the court has declared bandits, kidnappers, cattle rustlers as terrorists.\n\n\u201cSo, with or without the gazette, what gives effect to such declaration is a judicial pronouncement but the gazette is a mere formality and it has been on and I believe within a matter of days, it will be concluded.\u201d",

As the lgbo saying goes, when a child is crying and pointing at a particular direction, it is because either his mother or father is there.

          "text": "\u2026say he remains uncommon workers-friendly gov.\n\n\u2026as govt doles out cars, other prizes to workers, says they are brains behind its success story\n\nIn Grand display of pomp and circumstance on Tuesday morning, Osun workers welcomed and ushered in the State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, into office after the Yuletide.\n\nThey lauded the contributions of the Governor to the growth and development of the civil service in the State as manifested in the priority given to their welfare and well-being since assumption of office.\n\nThis is even as the Governor presented cars and other star prizes facilitated by the government to outstanding workers for their commitment and dedication to duty, saying their unflinching support, cooperation and understanding had been magnanimous.\n\nThe workers received the Governor at the Main Gate of the State Government Secretariat with solidarity songs and funfair to demonstrate their gratitude and appreciation for his passion and love for the state workforce.\n\nThe workers, led by the State Chairman, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Jacob Adekomi, and the Head of Service, Dr. Festus Olowogboyega Oyebade, trekked with the Governor from the Gate to the Governor\u2019s office parking lot, the venue of the yearly inter-religious prayer session organised to mark the first work day and herald the New Year.\n\nThe elated, enthusiastic and jubilant workers were seen with pro-government banners with different inscriptions such as \u201cOsun Workers are saying Thank You\u201d; \u201cWe are solidly behind you and your Adminstration\u201d; \u201cThank You for being there for us\u201d, among others.\n\nSpeaking at the prayer session, the Osun Chairman, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Jacob Adekomi, attributed the rousing welcome of the Governor to the continued support the workers had received from him since assumption of office.\n\nAdekomi, who described Oyetola as the best helmsman and an astute manager of human and material resources, said the gains recorded so far by the state workforce remain unquantifiable under his watch.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, we give glory to God for sparing our lives till date because if not, who are we? As workers, we are very happy today because Mr. Governor has been very attentive to our plights. He has been listening to agitations and demands.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, another innovation has come our way today as Mr. Governor has donated cars to some workers, the first of its kind in the history of the State since its creation.\n\n\u201cAlso, Mr. Governor has approved Car Refurbishing Loans for workers. This is what we have been agitating for over the years. He has given civil service a facelift and he has equally approved our 10,000 hectares of land for the construction of over 180 housing units for the benefit of workers in the State to mention but a few because we have series of achievements to his credit.\n\n\u201cIf we are to begin to mention what he has done for us, we will not come to an end. Though we still have some other agitations, so far so good, Mr. Governor has done excellently well for the workers. That is why we workers in our volition came out en masse to receive him warmly back to office after the Yuletide celebrations.\n\n\u201cI urge my colleagues at various levels to continue to give their support to him and his Government as he continues to champion our cause,\u201d Adekomi added.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Oyetola described the workforce in the State as the brain behind the success story of the Administration as their labours, passion, discipline and conviction constituted the wings upon which the Administration flies in fulfilling its sacred mandate.\n\nHe implored them to commit to doing better, improve their personal and collective productivity, and rededicate themselves to the Omoluabi ethos.\n\nOyetola described year 2021 as one in which the State recorded very significant achievements that made life better for the people and placed them on a surer footing of sustainable economic development.\n\nHe said the preceding year also brought the citizens nearer to their envisioned destination of an Osun that is absolutely prosperous and a pride to all and sundry.\n\nHe noted that his Administration has kept faith with his electoral promise of putting workers\u2019 welfare first and ensuring that they are duly compensated for their invaluable contributions.\n\nGovernor Oyetola urged the residents to continue to maintain peace, religious tolerance and harmonious relationship that the State was known for.\n\n\u201cI feel particularly gratified that in you our hardworking, sacrificial and resilient workers, we have found dependable allies in our focused quest for the transformation of our dear State.\n\n\u201cIndeed the journey of the last three years plus since our assumption of office cannot be told without taking stock of the invaluable support we have enjoyed from you.\n\n\u201cYour labours, passion, discipline and conviction in our Development Agenda constitute the wings upon which our administration flies in fulfilling its sacred mandate.\n\n\u201cIt is in appreciation of your sustained partnership we have ensured that we keep faith with our electoral promise of putting your welfare first and ensuring that you are duly compensated for your invaluable contributions.\n\n\u201cSo, if you have observed that we have never defaulted in paying salaries as and when due, deliberately entrenched reward mechanisms to recognize exceptional service deliveries, restored the car loan scheme and even commenced the implementation of the minimum wage regime among various other interventions, it is in registering our unreserved appreciation to you for serving and labouring to build the economy of our State.\n\n\u201cFor us, motivating you is beyond a clever political point. It is a sacred duty we owe you and our God whose injunction in the Holy Book is that workers are deserving of ripping the good for which they have ardently laboured. We shall continue to sustain this injunction without fail.\n\n\u201cI must equally use this opportunity to assure all our retirees that we are fully committed to you. Not only would we continue to pay the pensions, we shall also redouble efforts in meeting up with obligations owed by previous administrations.\n\n\u201cAs we begin the journey of a new year, which, in many ways, is another defining year for our State, I urge us to commit to doing better, improve our personal and collective productivity, rededicate ourselves to the Omoluabi ethos that define us as a special people and race.\n\n\u201cLet us shun indolence under whatever guise and reposition ourselves for a diligent and a more fulfilling work life.\n\n\u201c As we settle down to begin work this 2022, let us all remember to observe the Covid-19 protocol in our collective interest. We must at all times remember that the pandemic is still very much around and manifesting in waves.\n\n\u201cAs a show of leadership, I have taken the first, second and even the booster vaccine, It is safe. I implore all those who are yet to take the vaccines to please do so,\u201d the governor said.\n\nIn their separate lectures, the Chief Imam, Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Imam Taofeek Abdulhammed and State Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, Bishop Amos Ogunrinde, admonised the people to always put God first in whatever they do.\n\nThe clerics who advocated peaceful coexistence called on the people to see their positions, powers and other worldly things as ephemeral, saying they must be conscious of the day of accountability and stewardship before the Creator.\n\nThe cars beneficiaries are a Public Health Nurse, Mrs. Adeosun Francisca Adebola; a staff of the Ministry of Works, Engr. Adepoju Rasak Daramola; a Primary School Teacher, Mrs. Abiola Grace Aduke; a Secondary School Teacher, Mr. Adeyemo Isiaka Adeoye and OSBC Reporter, Mr. Yemi Aboderin.\n\nOther workers went home with different prizes like Plasma TV and Refrigerator among others.",

          "title": "APC Convention: Why February date is sacrosanct \u2013 PGF boss",
          "text": "A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Director General Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) Salihu Moh Lukman has faulted campaign in some quarters for the postponement of the party\u2019s national convention from February date.\n\nThe APC chieftain described as \u2018illogical\u2019 recommendation through a letter written by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu to the APC CECPC Chairman, Mai Mala Buni, dated December 13, 2021, calling for the postponement of the APC convention.\n\nIn an open letter to all the APC leaders Monday in Abuja, Lukman warned of the repeat of 2019 Zamfara experience if the needful was not done.\n\nThe APC chieftain said: \u201cIt is very difficult to excuse the CECPC from the campaign to postpone the February Convention. If the CECPC is not interested in the postponement of the Convention from the agreed February 2022 date, why is it difficult to make formal announcement about the date and venue of the Convention? Statutorily, by the requirement of the Electoral Act, the party is expected to serve at least 21 days\u2019 notice of the Convention to INEC, which basically means that if the Convention is to hold any day before February 28, 2021, the notice to INEC should be given on or before February 7, 2022. That being the case, the temptation could be to argue that there is more time. Some reminders would be necessary at this point.\n\n\u201cOnce that is the case, we would have succeeded in making the 2019 Zamfara electoral disaster a national phenomenon in 2023. Is that what the CECPC members under the leadership of His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni want to subject the party to?\u201d\n\nThe letter warned Governor Mai Mala Buni not to allow all his good work as CECPC be destroyed.\n\n\u201cWith the emergence of the CECPC in June 2020, His Excellency Mai Mala has done an excellent job by bringing down tension within the party. Sadly, all the good work of the CECPC under His Excellency Mai Mala is about to be destroyed once it yields to the temptation of staying longer than February 2022,\u201d the PGF boss said.\n\nWhile calling on APC leaders to wake up to the responsibility of providing the needed political leadership to the country, Lukman said: \u201cNo one should imagine that agendas set in 2014 or 2019 are sufficient to respond to contemporary challenges, which post-2023 governance will be expected to respond to. If anything, it may also be important to emphasise the fact that to respond to contemporary challenges facing the country would require massive investment in human capital development in the country.\n\n\u201cThis will call for a deliberate and aggressive policy to mobilise large scale public investment to rebuild public schools at all levels. The correlation between collapse of education since the mid 1980s, rising levels of unemployment and insecurity are very glaring. As a party, we must come up with practically convincing answers, which should form the basis of public support by Nigerians to guarantee victory in 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe burden of responsibility to strengthen the capacity of the APC to put itself on a vantage position to commence internal negotiation around all these issues is on the CECPC, especially, the Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cInability to discharge this responsibility or avoid it by toying the path of a deceptive campaign for postponement of Convention can only spell doom for the APC and return Nigeria to the hands of those who laid the foundation for all the challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cBy way of an appeal to APC leaders, as much as the question of who emerge as the candidate of the party is very important, it is not only who emerge as a candidate of the party that can win the election. But how united are party leaders behind the candidate will be a more determining factor. President Buhari, with all his mass support in the Northern part of the country, may not have won the election in 2015 without the unity of all APC leaders from every part of the country. All APC leaders must be reminded that, there is no one political leader in the country that enjoy convincing mass support of any region of the country.\u201d\n\nInsisting on agreed February date for the national convention, Salihu said: \u201cThe only reason why some leaders, perhaps including the members of CECPC, are attracted to campaign for postponement for the Convention is the deceptive belief that any candidate who emerged, whether elected or imposed on the party can win the 2023 elections. This is a big lie!\n\n\u201cFinally, we must also appeal to the CECPC to ensure that the February 2022 Convention is not just about electing NWC members. There must be some reflections about the challenges facing the country, with priority focus on problems of insecurity, rebuilding public education and health through mobilisation of massive financial investment in these sectors.\u201d\n\nObahiagbon urges Buhari, CECPC\n\nIn a related development, an APC chieftain and former federal lawmaker, Hon. Patrick Obahiagbon, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari and the Buni-led CECPC to propound a pathway for the party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nObahiagbon gave the charge Monday in Abuja, in a letter of commendation to the committee chairman.\n\nThe former legislator further advised that personal and selfish interests must not override the interest of the party.\n\n\u201cThe party interest is more paramount than parochial and self centered agitations from a microscopic few\u201d he said.\n\nHe said \u201cthe facts are indubitably too plain to be contested Your Excellency, that our great party was largely fractious and tottering at its perilous precipice and brinks, when both destiny and history beckoned on you to provide durable leadership for us all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the considered opinion of the majority of our party members that Your Excellency has not just only steered the party away from avoidable cataracts and icebergs but that you have also enviably returned our party to its winning ways and glorious path,\u201d he said.\n\nThe legislator said the inspiring leadership style and consultative approach of the Chairman in addition to the \u201ccoruscating humility, visceral connectivity with the rank and file of the party and disciplined interpersonal skills has commended itself to all and sundry.\u201d",

          "text": "A renowned Third Republic politician and runner-up in the controversially annulled June 12, 1993 election, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa is dead.\n\nThe 74-year-old former presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC), family sources said, passed on after a brief illness at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital Kano at about 4.00am Monday.\n\nIt was also gathered that the elder statesman was just recovering from an illness he had battled with for about a week which he could not however survive.\n\nHis death came 23 years after his opponent in the 1993 election and candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Bashorun MKO Abiola passed on under some mysterious circumstances while in incarceration.\n\nThe shocking news of Tofa\u2019s death came at a time residents were in their homes battling with the cold weather and observing the new year holiday.\n\nHis corpse was buried at Hajj Camp, a public cemetery in the Kano metropolis, with the brief funeral rites completed at his Gandun Albasa residence after the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado-Bayero, prayed for the repose of his soul.\n\nAt the solemn ceremony wereformer governor of Kano state, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, a former Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, and a former Secretary to the Kano State Government, Sule Yahaya-Hamma among several others.\n\nAnd as a mark of respect, President Muhammadu Buhari has sent a federal government delegation to Kano to commiserate with the deceased\u2019s family.\n\n\u2018Death premonition\u2019\n\nThe elder statesman was in recent time at various public functions, including a one-day sensitisation workshop organised two months ago by the Gidado Mukhtar-led Northern Reform Organisation (NRO) at the Centre for Democratic Studies, Mambaya House, Kano some two months ago.\n\nAddressing the gathering comprising northern youth, the politician told his audience that he and his age group were at the point of exiting the world and meeting their creator, a statement suggesting he may have had the premonition of his death.\n\nHe used the forum to admonish the North to embrace the concept of unity and brotherhood for the region to maintain and uphold its revered status.\n\nTaking his turn at the event, the business mogul said where leaders at the top echelon of authority became utterly spineless and inactive; the situation could only be complicated with no lasting solution in sight.\n\n\u201cThe North is almost on the precipice in all directions. Banditry, kidnapping by those who are heartless have become the order of the day and the degree of insouciance and lack of concern exhibited by those calling the shots in the corridors of power is highly outrageous. It is high time for all concerned northerners to wake up from their slumber. There is the compelling need for us to match our words with action.\n\n\u201cThe future of the country belongs to the youths who are supposed to rise to the challenge of the present time. It is your responsibility to buckle up and do what is right in the bid to reposition the country on a high pedestal. We are telling you this because we have almost exhausted our sojourn on the planet. What is left for us at present is to answer the call of our creator. We did what we were supposed to do in pushing the country to greater height,\u201d the elder statesman had said.\n\nWhile also counselling youth on their relationship with politicians, he said: \u201cI also want to remind you people on the need to avoid falling into the hands of some egocentric and self-centred politicians whose major pre-occupation is to use you as cannon-fodder in achieving their selfish and capricious design at the time they became desperate to clinch power. They are using you as mere guinea pigs in the dirty game to grab power at all cost. You should be wary of this sinister design.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call yourself a leader when you are stealing and fleecing the public treasury. You can\u2019t be respected while you are busy amassing ill-gotten wealth at the expense of the peoples\u2019 interest. We have had our time, and we are not going to remain on this planet forever. We want people most especially the youths to rise to the challenge of resisting leaders with primordial interest and egocentric permutations,\u201d Tofa further told his audience.\n\nBuhari, Ganduje mourn\n\nAnd in a condolence message, President Muhammadu Buhari described Tofa as \u201ca politician of note, who was also a promoter of Islamic culture and civilisation.\u201d\n\nHe said the deceased was a true nationalist that would be difficult to replace\n\nThe president said this in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe late Tofa was noted for his untiring commitment to public enlightenment and was unafraid to speak the truth all the time that he lived.\n\n\u201cHe set up the Bureau for Islamic Propagation, BIP, in the mid-80s that helped to unite Muslim Scholars in the Northern States, narrowing the differences that characterised their relationships. The BIP also published books and newspapers.\n\n\u201cHe was, till the end, a patriot to the core. He envisaged a better Nigeria for all. We pray that this dream and collective aspiration and necessary commitment will not go with him. We owe it to his memory and to the nation.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari prayed Allah to repose his soul and grant the bereaved family and friends, the Kano Emirate Council as well as the government and people of Kano state the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nThe statement also said the president dispatched a delegation to Kano with a condolence letter to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje.\n\nOn the team were Ministers of Defence, Bashir Magashi, and Water Resources, Sulaiman Adamu, accompanied by the Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), Garba Shehu, and the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris.\n\nGanduje\n\nIn a similar condolence, Governor Ganduje said Tofa\u2019s contributions to Nigeria\u2019s democracy remained indelible.\n\nIn a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the governor said Tofa started taking up leadership responsibilities at an early age when he was elected councillor in Tofa in his late 20s.\n\nThe governor said he remained vibrant and dynamic up till the time of his death.\n\nAs a businessman, trader, and philanthropist, the governor said Tofa touched the lives of many people, especially the down-trodden, and expressed the belief that the legacies of the deceased would be approximated for posterity.\n\n\u201cThe legacy of his political beliefs and triumphs will be important footnotes in the literature of Nigeria\u2019s government and politics for generations yet to come.\n\n\u201cHe was a great man, a quintessential democrat and outstanding statesman who has left veryhold prints both on the politics and political history of Nigeria, \u201cthe statement further said.\n\nHe prayed Almighty Allah to grant his soul Aljannah Firdausi and the fortitude for his family, friends and associates to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nAtiku\n\nSimilarly, former Vice President and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar, described Tofa as \u201ca thoroughbred democrat whose contributions to the growth of democratic governance in Nigeria is invaluable.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, the former VP noted that, \u201cthroughout his political career, the late Tofa was a politician who believed in the power of ideas and ideologies and was never associated with political violence or any other anti-democratic behaviour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Waziri Adamawa, who was in touch with Tofa until his last days, stressed that the statesman and politician, who had been preoccupied with the state of affairs in Nigeria in recent times, and especially as it impacted the North, was a \u201cbalanced and incisive\u201d personality.\n\n\u201cAccording to Atiku, his (Tofa\u2019s) style of politics and the panache with which he engaged political opponents will remain classical in Nigeria\u2019s political history and are worthy of emulation by contemporary political actors and the future generations.\n\n\u201cAtiku therefore expresses his deepest condolence to the bereaved families and associates of the late patriarch and political icon and the people and government of Kano State. He prays to the Almighty Allah to grant him Aljannah Firdaus,\u201d Ibe said.\n\nAnyim, Badaru too\n\nAlso, a presidential aspirant of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) described him as one committed to a peaceful Nigeria.\n\nThe former Senate President said \u201cthroughout the electioneering campaigns leading to the 1993 presidential elections, in which he was the candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Tofa never did anything, in words or actions, that could have instigated crisis in any form.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his media adviser, Sam Nwaobasi, the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation(SGF) noted that the late Tofa was a committed Nigerian who throughout his more than 40 years of active partisan politics demonstrated his strong belief in politics of accommodation and consensus building.\n\n0\u2033He was so committed to a peaceful Nigeria that throughout the electioneering campaigns leading to the 1993 presidential elections, in which he was the candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Tofa never did anything, in words or actions, that could have instigated crisis in any form.\n\n\u201cSen. Anyim commends Alhaji Tofa\u2019s \u201cpolitics without bitterness\u201d and strongly recommends such disposition to politicians of today in the interest of the peace, unity and harmony of our dear country even as we approach the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cSen Anyim regrets that Alhaji Tofa died when his experience and elderly counsel would be most needed as the country battles with multiple challenges.\n\n\u201cSen. Anyim deeply condoles with the late Alhaji Tofa\u2019s family, the good people of Kano State and Alhaji Tofa\u2019s many friends and associates all over Nigeria. He prays that Almighty God will grant the Soul of Alhaji Tofa eternal rest,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn another condolence message, Jigawa state Governor Muhammad Badaru lauded the late politician as a statesman, industrialist, politician and community leader.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Habibu Kila, the governor said the politician lived and died in the service of humanity.\n\nNorthern speakers mourn\n\nIn yet another message, the Northern Speakers Forum lauded the deceased industrialist as a perfect gentleman.\n\nThe forum\u2019s chairman and Speaker Kaduna State House of Assembly, Yusuf Zailani, said this in a statement by his media aide, Ibrahim Danfulani.\n\nHe said: \u201cAll through his life time, he was never named among controversial politicians that flame embers of disunity, confusion and disintegration.\u201d\n\nThey said Tofa never played do-or-die politics, noting that he was an embodiment of democracy at its finest.\n\n\u201cHe will be deeply missed by all for his silent role in stabilising the polity,\u201d the statement added.\n\nNRO, Arewa youth\n\nIn his tribute, NRO chairman, Alhaji Mukhtar described the deceased politician \u201cas a great icon of high repute who had toiled blood and sweat in serving humanity.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the late elder states man died with the ambition of making Kano a citadel of pride in all spheres of human endeavours, stressing that losing a personality of his calibre is a great loss to the entire society.\n\nHe extolled the Tofa\u2019s in the promotion of the norms and ideals of the Islamic religion and called on his contemporaries to emulate him.\n\nIn another message of condolence, the chairperson, Arewa Youth Consultative Council (AYCC), Zaidu Ayuba, described Tofa as the most reliable, promising and listening pillar of the group.\n\nAyuba said the deceased who was the patron to the AYCC was its greatest pillar that always tried to \u201cshield us from misbehaving as youths with exuberance. He always taught us tact and approaches in politics.\n\n\u201cToday, we lost our greatest pillar. This is a non recuperating loss. We pray for Allah\u2019s mercy and Rahma to his soul. May Aljannah be his home, May we find the fortitude to bear the loss with strong Iman. Farewell to our leader,\u201d AYCC said in a statement.\n\nNorthern summit on hold\n\nMeanwhile, a Coalition of 52 Northern Groups (CNG) has postponed its planned security summit following the death of Alhaji Tofa.\n\nCNG\u2019s national coordinator, Balarabe Rufai, announced this Monday while briefing journalists in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the late Tofa was billed to chair the occasion which was earlier slated for the 5th and 6th of January 2022 in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nWhile noting that Tofa\u2019s death came as a huge shock, Rufai said: \u201cOn behalf of the entire CNG family and affiliates, we express a deep sense of sorrow over the death of this elder statesman and mentor, who was a one-time presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe CNG owes immeasurable gratitude to the late Bashir Tofa whose leadership, sacrifice, statesmanship, patriotism and unwavering commitment to the interests of the people of Northern Nigeria, and citizens of Nigeria as a whole has few parallels.\n\n\u201cWe mourn the passing of this man from whose life and works we have drawn inspiration and we must strive, in all we do, to live with the personal and social values and standards he lived and set for himself.\n\n\u201cThe late Tofa was a passionate believer of the organic links between generations who was always available for young people.\n\n\u201cThe CNG in particular, the North and Nigeria generally have certainly lost a great statesman, but the youth lost a mentor, guardian, living history and an embodiment of all the exemplary qualities young Northerners should strive to achieve.\n\n\u201cAs a mark of respect and with a grieving heart, we wish to announce the inadvertent postponement of the planned Pan Northern Security Summit scheduled for 5th and 6th of January to a date to be announced soon. The late Bashir Othman Tofa was to be the chairman of the occasion,\u201d Rufai said.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to condole with the convener of the Northern Elders Forum, Professor Ango Abdullahi; the Chairman of Arewa Consultative Forum, Chief Audu Ogbeh; the BOT Chairman of Coalition of Northern Groups, Dr Nastura Ashir Sharrif; and the entire CNG family over the loss of this great man,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe lingering land dispute at the Magodo Phase II Estate in Lagos took a different dimension on Tuesday as a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) publicly defied the order of the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to vacate the premises.\n\nAmid a protest by residents, Governor Sanwo-Olu arrived at the estate in company with some members of his cabinet, including the Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General of the state, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo, and the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, among others.\n\nHe engaged the yet-to-be-identified CSP who led the police team on the operation from Abuja and asked them to vacate the estate.\n\n[READ ALSO] Magodo Land Dispute: Sanwo-Olu Visits Estate, Invites All Parties For Talks\n\nBut the police officer affirmed that his team would only leave the premises on the directive of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Inspector General of Police who had deployed them on the assignment.\n\n\u201cPlease, can you call your superior in Abuja that you need to deactivate, and you need to leave Lagos now?\u201d said the governor who was surrounded by government officials, residents, and journalists.\n\n\u201cCan you call your superior in Abuja and tell them that the governor is here, and I am the Chief Security Officer, and that you don\u2019t have any business being in my state right now and that I want you to disengage forthwith from here?\u201d\n\n\u2018Call Them Directly\u2019\n\nIn his response, the defiant officer wearing a green polo shirt and a brown cap said, \u201cThank you very much, sir. Your Excellency sir, I\u2019m not here on my own order.\n\n\u201cI am here on the instruction of the Inspector General of Police through the AGF. I am too small or too low to call them. Your Excellency sir, with due respect sir, you can call them directly sir so that they can tell us to come.\u201d\n\nBefore the arrival of the governor, residents of the estate had staged a protest to condemn the planned takeover of their properties.\n\nThey decried the invasion of the estate by a team of policemen alleged to be providing security for court bailiffs said to have sealed some properties in the enforcement of a Supreme Court judgement.\n\nCarrying placards with various inscriptions to vent their concerns, the residents also faulted the continued presence of the police team despite an earlier intervention by the governor.\n\nDespite being informed by Governor Sanwo-Olu who hinted that he had contacted the AGF and that the latter said he had no knowledge that the police team was still at the estate, the CSP insisted, \u201cIt is not my duty to call because I am too low to do that sir.\u201d\n\nIllegal Operation\n\nThereafter, the governor asked the leader of the police team to give an account of the number of policemen at the estate.\n\n\u201cI have several of them, sir. I cannot precisely tell you how many we are,\u201d the CSP replied the governor. \u201cI know the number of my men here sir, we sought for some other people to join us. But for security purpose, I cannot say this is the figure, sir.\u201d\n\nObviously dissatisfied with the response and action of the defiant police officer, Governor Sanwo-Olu declared the presence of the security team at the estate as illegal.\n\nHe also questioned the motive behind the operation, stressing that the issue only involved the state government and had nothing to do with the residents in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt is a very illegal operation,\u201d said a visibly angry governor. \u201cThey (policemen) are not from the Lagos State Police Command. They said they are from Abuja, and I don\u2019t know what other interests they have beyond keeping the peace of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is not an expectation that I would expect for them because they don\u2019t have any business here at all.

          "text": "Sudanese security forces have beefed up security in and around Khartoum as pro-democracy protesters called for mass rallies in a bid to keep up pressure on the ruling military following the resignation of civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nActivists on Tuesday said authorities closed roads in the capital and its twin city of Omdurman in an effort to prevent demonstrators from reaching key government buildings.\n\nHamdok, who was deposed and put under house arrest in an October 25 coup, had returned to government on November 21 under a deal signed with military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.\n\nBut pro-democracy protesters who had denounced the military\u2019s power grab also rejected its deal with Hamdok, whom they accused of \u201cbetrayal\u201d for signing an agreement that ensured the military\u2019s dominance in Sudanese politics.\n\nTens of thousands of people have continued taking to the streets despite a heavy security crackdown that has killed at least 57 protesters and wounded hundreds since the coup, according to a medical group.\n\nIn his televised resignation on Sunday, Hamdok said: \u201cI tried my best to stop the country from sliding towards disaster\u201d and cited \u201cfragmentation of the political forces and conflicts between the [military and civilian] components of the transition\u201d.\n\nHamdok had served as prime minister for more than two years under a power-sharing arrangement between civilian leaders and the generals who removed longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.\n\nTuesday\u2019s protests have been called by the Sudanese Professionals Association and the Resistance Committees, which were the backbone of the popular uprising that al-Bashir\u2019s removal.\n\nThe protest movement insists on a fully civilian government to lead the transition towards elections, a demand rejected by the generals who say power will be handed over only to an elected government.\n\nElections are planned for July 2023.\n\nFollowing the prime minister\u2019s resignation, protesters told Al Jazeera they will not give up their fight for full civilian rule, \u201cwith or without Hamdok\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis removal, as far as [protesters] are concerned, removes the last fig leaf that was covering this regime and what remains is a full-fledged military dictatorship,\u201d Ahmed el-Gaili, a Sudanese lawyer and legal commentator, separately told Al Jazeera.\n\nProtesters in Sudan say they won\u2019t give up until the country is under civilian rule.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for \u201cmeaningful dialogue\u201d between all Sudanese parties to \u201creach an inclusive, peaceful and lasting solution,\u201d according to UN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric.\n\nSince his reinstatement in November, Hamdok has been unable to form a cabinet amid the relentless protests.\n\nDeliberations have been under way to find \u201can independent figure\u201d to lead a technocratic cabinet through elections, according to a military official and a protest leader who spoke to the Associated Press news agency condition of anonymity. Among the names floated was that of former Finance Minister Ibrahim Elbadawi.\n\nGibril Ibrahim, a rebel leader who joined Hamdok\u2019s government last year following a peace deal with the transitional administration, urged for a \u201cpolitical compromise\u201d to resolve the crisis.\n\n\u201cLet us agree to work together for the sake of Sudan,\u201d tweeted Ibrahim.\n\nAl-Burhan, head of the ruling Sovereign Council, said an independent cabinet with \u201cspecific tasks\u201d would be formed as the executive branch of the transitional government. The military, he said, would \u201cprotect the democratic transition\u201d until Sudan is able to hold free and fair elections.",
