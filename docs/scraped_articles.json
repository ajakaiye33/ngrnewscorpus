Two years and six months, we have not been integrated into the House of Assembly. We ,therefore, feel this is the right place to be.\u201d\n\nOsifo also said, \u201cIt is in the spirit to ensure that peoples rights are not jeopardized that we are here.\u201d\n\nHe gave an insight on how on March 17 2019, 24 members of the House of Assembly, were nominated, having won election.\n\nOsifo said, \u201cOn June 17 2019, 10 days after the expiration of the life span of the last assembly, Governor Godwin Obaseki failed to inaugurate us with a proclamation.\u201d\n\nThe petition by the aggrieved legislators titled, \u2018Complaint of gross abuse of powers and the precipitation of crisis at the Edo State House of Assembly by Alhaji Audu Yahaya Omogbai-Clerk of the Edo State House of Assembly,\u2019 was dated November 16 2021.\n\nIt was signed by Victor Edoror, Esan Central; Crosby Eribo, Egor; Washington Osa Osifo, Uhunmwode; Christopher Okaeben, Oredo West; Seid Oshiomhole, Etsako West 1; Michael Ohio Ezomo, Owan West, Sunday Aghedo, Ovia South West and seven others.\n\nThe petition read in part, \u201cAlthough, the Edo State House of Assembly was purportedly \u2018inaugurated\u2019 on the June 17, 2019 by the Clerk of the House, Alhaji Audu Omogbai, we were wrongfully and unconstitutionally excluded from the said \u201cinauguration\u201d, an act that has precipitated a constitutional crisis in the State where the EDHA, contrary to the clear and unambiguous provisions of section 91 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), is presently constituted by a minority of 10 members to the exclusion of 14 members, who constitute the majority.\u201d\n\nHe told the CCB boss that this action was a violation of provisions of Articles 1 and 9 of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers as contained in the 5th schedule to the constitution.\n\nIn response, the CCB chairman said, \u201cThe CCB is an unbiased umpire.

This smells like titles.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning\n\nHe joined Barca from Sevilla in 2008, collected 23 trophies in 391 appearances and scoring 21 goals.\n\nDani Alves left in 2016. But is back after two earlier attempts.\n\nHowever, it feels like nothing happened in those years, as his high spirits is sure to help his former teammate, now coach, Xavi, in the dressing room.\n\nAnd he has been given the No. 8 jersey. That\u2019s an additional call to duty, as the last player that had that number on his back was the inimitable Andres Iniesta.\n\nI\u2019m still shocked \u2014 Dani Alves\n\nDani Alves told BarcaTV+: \u201cI\u2019m still shocked. As I had said publicly, I had been trying to return for a long time.\n\n\u201cI tried twice to return, but it wasn\u2019t possible.\n\n\u201cNow, to return to work with people who know about my commitment on and off the pitch is a pleasure and a privilege.\n\n\u201cI always say that there are two shirts that make me feel like a superhero when I wear them: Brazil and Barcelona shirts.\n\n\u201cTo wear this shirt again gives me a boost of strength and adrenaline. I hope I can transmit that to my teammates.\n\n\u201cMy nicest memories in football happened here at Barcelona.\n\n\u201cMy home is here in Barcelona, my closest relatives live here in Barcelona, so it was inevitable that I returned to Barcelona.\n\n\u201cThe pleasant surprise is to come back as a player, but if not I would still have returned to Barcelona because it\u2019s a fascinating city that I love.\n\n\u201cWe need to believe that we are Barcelona, the best club in the world.\n\n\u201cSometimes it sounds demagogic to say \u2018it\u2019s the best club in the world\u2019, but I\u2019ve been elsewhere and I know what I\u2019m saying: this is the best club in the world, Barcelona is unique.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it just because I\u2019m here.

So you can do three in one; physical activity.\u201d\n\nThe endocrinologist notes that only a small percentage of people who are diabetic manifest symptoms.\n\nHe listed some of the symptoms of the condition to include passing \u201cplenty\u201d of urine, poor vision, poor erection, poor stamina, poor obstetric history including miscarriages and stillbirth, and itching on the skin.\n\nHe advised people living with protruding tummies to \u201cchange your lifestyle.

It is not poverty that makes a person look slim.\u201d\n\nWhile raising alarm that diabetes can affect all age groups including children, the professor advised people to go for checkups, \u201cThe simple way to do this is to check your own blood sugar in a laboratory whether or not you have diabetes.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Lifestyle Medicine Physician, Dr. Chinasa Amadi, said \u201cWith recent statistics predicting that one in 10 children born after the year 2000 will develop type 2 diabetes, there is no better time than today to begin advocacy.\n\nShe outlined some risk factors like unhealthy dietary habits, cigarettes, older age, physical inactivity, obesity, and family history of diabetes.\n\nAmadi added: \u201cWe need to go back to the basics \u2013 plant-based foods, our local foods, cooked not canned and processed.\u201d\n\nWith diabetes described as a chronic disease according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Diabetes Product Manager Mega Lifesciences, Ibukun Adetuyi cited that in 2019, diabetes was the ninth leading cause of death with an estimated 1.5 million deaths directly caused by diabetes.\n\nShe, therefore, urged Nigerians to take their health seriously.\n\n\u201cAccording to WHO, a healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Managing Director, Mega Lifesciences, Manesh Mehra, shared the vision of the firm \u2013 to take free screenings to communities and smaller towns across the nation to help them stay healthy.\n\nMehra said \u201cWe want to take medical outreach and quality education about the diabetes and its complications and lifestyle.

So, there will be no need for them to travel long distances to get pasture since the seasonal migration poses serious security risks and exposes them to economic loss,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Registrar, who is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nigerian Institute of Animal Science, Prof. Eustace Ayemere Iyayi, said the endeavour would help in meeting the increasing demand for fodder.\n\nProf. Iyayi explained that the institute would use irrigation and rain-fed pasture production techniques to develop the four hectares it received.\n\nManaging Director of Kano State Agricultural and Rural Development Agency\u2019s (KSADP\u2019s) executing agency, Dr Junaidu Yakubu Muhammad, promised that the state government would create the enabling environment for a mutually rewarding and sustainable partnership with the Nigerian Institute of Animal Science.",

Sustainable development is only possible when human rights become the cornerstone of governance.\n\n\u201cUnder this government, human rights\u2019 abuses have become the spur of violent conflicts, halting economic progress, growth and development.\n\n\u201cSecretary Bliken should, as a matter of urgency, hold the Nigerian government to account for the wanton assaults on rights, abuse of state power, systematic use of state violence to suppress peaceful protesters, particularly activists of the #EndSARS movement and campaigners for self-determination, extra-judicial killings, intimidation of the judiciary and declare to this government that abuses of human rights have consequences.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The panel was also saddled with the investigation of the alleged shootings that took place on October 20, 2020, at the Lekki Tollgate.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nOn Monday, the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led panel submitted its report, stating that the armed forces shot and killed protesters at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos last year.\n\nThe report accused Nigerian Army officers of having \u201cshot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification while they were waving the Nigerian flag and singing the national anthem and the manner of assault and killing could, in context, be described as a massacre.\u201d\n\nThe report said nine #EndSARS protesters were killed while security operatives at the scene reportedly prevented ambulances from reaching injured demonstrators.\n\nWhile the US government said it was watching to see how governments would handle the report, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), elder statesman and leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo and others said the report has proved that innocent Nigerian youths were actually killed.\n\nReacting in a statement, yesterday, the United States said it \u201cwelcomed the conclusion of the panel\u2019s report\u201d and was looking forward to \u201csuitable measures\u201d the Federal Government would take on allegations of abuses against some security agents indicted in the Lagos #EndSARS panel report.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the Lagos State government\u2019s response as part of a process that represents an important mechanism of accountability regarding the #EndSARS protests and the events that took place near the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cThose events led to serious allegations against some members of the security forces, and we look forward to the Lagos State and Federal Government\u2019s taking suitable measures to address those alleged abuses as well as the grievances of the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nPDP, in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan, urged Nigerians to stand for the slain youths by insisting that those behind the Lekki toll gate killing are prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe report of the Lagos EndSARS panel, which confirms the massacre of Nigerian youths in Lekki, has further shown the APC and its government as bloody liars whose hands are stained with the blood of our innocent compatriots.\n\n\u201cOf course, all those whose hands have become blood stained will never know peace.\n\n\u201cThe nation must ensure that such individuals are brought to book for their act of wickedness to humanity,\u201d the party said.\n\nAdebanjo, who described the Minister of information, Lai Mohammed, as a liar for claiming that nobody died, said the development has shown that the Federal Government tells a lot of lies to the public.\n\n\u201cYou and I knew that people were killed at Lekki, but the Federal Government said nobody was killed. We are finished in this country. Is it not the same Lekki that the Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola, talked about recovering a camera which was planted at the toll gate?\u201d\n\nThe former governor, who had visited the state last year to assess the extent of damage caused by hoodlums, \u201cspotted\u201d a camcorder, which he handed over to a government official. The viral footage of the recovery trended for weeks on the social media with many commentators doubting Fashola\u2019s claims.\n\nThis is as Mr. Femi Falana, senior advocate and interim chair, Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), said Lagos State government was duty bound to implement the recommendations of the panel even as he said it deserved commendation for the thorough investigation of police brutality in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cA certified copy of the report of the panel should be forwarded to President Muhammadu Buhari in view of the recommendation that the soldiers and police personnel who engaged in the torture and reckless murder of citizens be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cHaving received the report of the judicial commission, the Lagos State government is urged to accelerate the issuance of the White Paper as well as the implementation of the far reaching recommendations. The policemen who were killed by criminal elements during the protests should be honoured, notwithstanding that their family members have been compensated by the Lagos State Government. However, as police brutality has continued unabated, we call on the government to set up the Lagos State Human Rights Committee in line with the recommendation of the Panel. This was part of the unanimous resolutions of the members of the National Economic Council.\u201d\n\nFormer deputy national chairman of the PDP, Chief Olabode George, urged Governor Sanwo-Olu to apologise to Nigerians for the killing of defenseless protesters.\n\nGeorge said, during a press conference in Lagos, that, as the chief security officer of the state, the governor should take responsibility for what happened. He also advised the governor against reopening the toll gate.\n\n\u201cThe members of the panel acted well and have changed my mindset about the country. It is gladdening that we still have credible people. It was not just one person, it was a panel that sat and their names will be written in gold that they told the truth. They listened for months to testimonies and went through throve of evidence and wrote the report the way they saw it. The younger generation will read the report and judge the panel well, so I want to congratulate them.\n\n\u201cSanwo-Olu should know that he has a family name behind him both from his mother and his father\u2019s sides and that the truth has already been told. He should be straight with himself and his government and take the appropriate actions. To err is human and to forgive is divine. If he reads the document from the panel and make amends and apologise to the people of the state, that would be great. Lives were lost. He should read that document, make amends and apologise to the people of the state.\n\n\u201cThe killings that happened took place under Sanwo-Olu\u2019s watch. I was a governor and I left in 1990, and I have been in and out of leadership. If I had misbehaved, will I have the nerves to go into politics and talk to people? Sanwo-Olu is from an honorable family and, even if people are pushing him to reopen the toll gate, he should know that the truth about what happened there is already in the open,\u201d he said.\n\nA former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and presidential aspirant of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) for 2023 elections, Kingsley Moghalu, in a statement personally signed, said individuals in the Army and the Police who gave the unlawful orders for the extrajudicial killings, as well as those who pulled the trigger, must pay for their crimes with prosecution and imprisonment.\n\n\u201cAs I said when the news of the killings broke to the world, these are violations of international humanitarian law in addition to national laws. This was mass murder and attempted mass murder, pure and simple. The perpetrators must not go free, and adequate restitution, which also is within the mandate of the judicial panel, must be made to all the protesters who were murdered in cold blood, injured or assaulted.\u201d\n\nAlso, human rights activist, Malachy Ugwummadu, said the report reinforced the first-hand account of the Nigerian youths who insisted that their colleagues were unlawfully and extrajudicially murdered by the Nigerian law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cThe local and international media centres and organisations including CNN, BBC and even Amnesty International that held the view that Nigerians were unlawfully killed stand vindicated today.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, victims and relatives of victims of these illegal and callous violence can pursue further legal redress including the enforcement of the fundamental rights of their relations in our regular High Courts. I personally pursued a case on behalf of a victim before the panel and got compensation but that was on behalf of a living victim.\u201d\n\nSecretary General of CNPP, Chief Willy Ezeugwu, expressed happiness that the panel report was out and observed that it has proved yet again that Nigerians are dealing with a government that is not sincere with the citizenry.\n\n\u201cMinister of Information, Lai Mohammed, should resign with immediate effect. He has so much tarnished the image of the country. The government has been trying to cover up what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate but the truth has come out. With this report, the international community will now know that what Nigerians are saying is true,\u201d he said.\n\nExecutive Director of Rule of Law and Accountability Centre, Mr. Okechukwu Nwanguma, thanked the panel for demonstrating the highest level of courage and patriotism in dealing with the massacre and urged the White Paper Committee to ensure that they do not water down the key issues in the report.\n\nHe said those found culpable should be punished to serve as a deterrence to what has become a habit of soldiers and policemen shooting protesters.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Says there\u2019s strong synergy between monetary and fiscal authorities\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has revealed that the central bank has so far disbursed about N3 trillion to households, small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs), smallholder farmers, pharmaceutical companies as buffer against the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with Arise Television on the sidelines of the recently-concluded Nigerian International Partnership Forum in Paris, France, Emefiele noted that the insinuation that the CBN was overreaching its statutory bounds, was baseless, explaining that the bank had continued to play its monetary management role effectively.\n\nHe also reiterated that the monetary and fiscal authorities were working hand in hand to deliver a stronger economy to Nigerians.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the job of the CBN was to complement the efforts of the fiscal side, emphasising that it had never happened in the country where the central bank would lend funds for a tenure of 10 years with a two-year moratorium, like the CBN had done in recent times.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you this, between 2020 and now, our data shows that we have disbursed at least N2 trillion, almost N3 trillion in loans to households, to MSMEs, to smallholder farmers, to pharmaceuticals and health institutions.\n\n\u201c We have also given these funds to some of our large agricultural companies that want to get back again to business, to manufacturing companies who are accessing long term 10 years loan with two-year moratorium with single digit rate. I have data that shows we are playing our part,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the recently launched \u201c100 for 100 \u201c, he noted that it was floated to support employment creation, assuring that the central bank would do everything possible to provide foreign exchange to import plants and machinery.\n\nHe added that the programme would complement the plan by President Muhammadu Buhari to create millions of jobs and make credit available at a cheap rate even for a long tenure.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the prerequisites, at least 80 per cent of the employees within these new corporate entities would have to be Nigerian,\u201d Emefiele insisted.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe know that people would like to play some games but I can assure you that the central bank has the resources to monitor.\n\n\u201cEven our current intervention programmes, whether in agriculture or in manufacturing, those who have accessed those facilities will tell you that at least twice a year, our people go to check and investigate to know whether those projects have been set up and are meeting their objective.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the insinuations that there was no alignment between Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies were baseless, stressing that on Covid-19 for instance, the CBN had been working with the finance ministry to reduce the devastating impact.\n\n\u201cIf you ask the Finance Minister, we are always in contact and she would tell you that there are no issues about the relationship between the monetary and fiscal authority. So, when people say there is no synergies, again, I wonder where that is coming from.\n\n\u201cWhen the COVID-19 hit, Mr. President tasked the Finance Minister and I to work together to bring us an immediate response and I went back to the Bankers\u2019 Committee and we came up with immediate response.\n\n\u201cAnd the Minister of Finance and I had opportunities several times to go back to brief the president. So, it is left for you to respond whether there is collaboration between monetary and fiscal authority there.\n\n\u201cAfter that, the president said we should establish the Economic Sustainability Program (ESP) chaired by the Vice President. The central bank played an active part in the development of that program to the extent that the fiscal authorities were only meant to contribute N500 billion and monetary authorities were left to provide almost about N1.5 trillion,\u201d he added.\n\nHe expressed joy that Nigeria now produces and consumes its own rice, stressing that the wheat programme had also taken off with expected yield very encouraging.\n\nHe stated that Nigeria would not be a guinea pig for cryptocurrency use, saying the CBN has now launched its own digital currency which is safer and more secure than crypto.\n\nEmefiele stated that with e-naira, some payment products that were costly, will be reduced forcing the banks to review their processes, saying that Nigeria will not make its platforms available for crypto. \u201cWhy is it encrypted. It means that there\u2019s level of illegality associated with it,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe argued that no country with high level financial standards endorse cryptocurrency, insisting that \u201cwe will not allow it to happen.\u201d\n\nEmefiele disclosed that he was always in contact with the minister of finance, budget and economic planning, insisting that there are no issues concerning the relationship between the monetary and fiscal authorities. \u201cSo, when people say there is no synergy, again, I wonder where that is coming from,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CBN governor added that the current administration would continue to focus on the provision of infrastructure and deliver legacy project.\n\n\u201cBy the time we sit back after we have left this job and we see it doing well, we would thank God we had an opportunity to serve our country,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to the CBN helmsman, it was high time Nigeria stopped relying on an economy that depends on oil.\n\n\u201cWe must diversify the economy into the non-oil sectors. We must deepen our economy so that we can truly position ourselves as a country that is self-sufficient,\u201d he explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Falana, who is Interim Chair of the Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), stated that the report had exposed the official lie that the brutal killings were a figment of the protesters\u2019 imaginations.\n\nHowever, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, said on Tuesday in Benin City that only a White Paper from the #EndSARS judicial panel\u2019s report could be the basis for informed comment.\n\nBut Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA) demanded the institution of criminal prosecution against those indicted in the #ENDSARS report. The civil society group said this in a statement by its Director of Programmes, Philip Jakpor.\n\nThe judicial panel led by Justice Doris Okuwobi (rtd) had on Monday submitted a 309-page report to the Lagos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, which indicted the army, police, and the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) for various crimes, ranging from killing innocent protesters to trying to conceal evidence.\n\nThe federal and Lagos State governments had at various times maintained that there were no deaths at the Lekki tollgate, effectively absolving themselves of any blames in the October 20, 2020 incident.\n\nHowever, the panel of inquiry said 48 casualties were recorded at the tollgate, including 11 deaths, several missing persons, and many injured persons. It said 96 other corpses were presented to it by a Forensic Pathologist, Professor John Obafunwa.\n\nA statement yesterday by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria said the submission of the report of the judicial panel was a welcome development. He stated that the submission of the findings of the panel would accelerate the process of justice and accountability for those impacted by the incident.\n\n\u201cI urge the government to implement the recommendations of the judicial panel of inquiry to rebuild trust and start the process of healing and reconciliation,\u201d Kallon added.\n\nIn a similar release yesterday, the U.S. government called for accountability in the implementation of the JPI report. It urged the Lagos State government and the federal government to take appropriate steps to address the alleged abuses.\n\nThe U.S. government said the report seriously indicted some members of the country\u2019s security apparatus, stating that it is eagerly awaiting the response of government at the state and federal levels to the document.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe United States welcomes the conclusion of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry with the transmission of its final report. We look forward to the Lagos State government\u2019s response as part of a process that represents an important mechanism of accountability regarding the #EndSARS protests and the events that took place near the Lekki Tollgate on October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cThose events led to serious allegations against some members of the security forces, and we look forward to the Lagos State and federal governments taking suitable measures to address those alleged abuses as well as the grievances of the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nPeterside said on Arise Television that Nigerian youth now had a chance to channel their anger and energies to make a statement in the 2023 general election by ensuring only credible persons run the affairs of the country henceforth.\n\nAccording to the businessman, to ensure peace and unity in Nigeria, justice and truth must be critical principles guiding both the leaders and the followers.\n\n\u201cA nation that prominent liars are at the front will not make any progress and it becomes very dangerous because even when they are trying to tell the truth, nobody believes them,\u201d he stated.\n\nPeterside insisted that it was laughable that someone could sit in Abuja and confidently deny what occurred at the Lekki Tollgate, when those at the scene of the killings gave first-hand accounts of what transpired.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is tempting to laugh at those in government who came out and started making all kinds of wild statements. Why would somebody who was in Abuja be making statements about what happened and did not happen in Lekki when the named soldiers who were in Lekki have refused to open their mouths to say anything in front of a judicial panel?\n\n\u201cMy assumption as a lay person is that the person who was on a crime scene knows that if he goes to a judicial panel and takes an oath and they ask him, did you or did you not kill somebody? Who did you shoot? He could be in trouble.\n\n\u201cSo, if that person is running away, I expect others to have the wisdom to say, hang on a second, don\u2019t ask me any questions, go and ask those who were at the scene.\u201d\n\nPeterside described officials who pushed a contrary narrative on the incident as \u201coverzealous people in government\u201d making hasty conclusions. But he commended the panel members for their courage and forthrightness.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we have some heroes from this exercise and it\u2019s at such moments that nations get formed. If there was no Lekki Tollgate, there are many things that may never happen in this country,\u201d he stated, cautioning the Lagos State government against shielding security operatives and government officials indicted by the report.\n\nAccording to Peterside, \u201cThe Lekki Tollgate incident of October 20, 2020 may well be an important tipping point. Let\u2019s wait for the White Paper from the Lagos State government. But from the little we all saw, and we\u2019ve got brains, I would like to see how the Lagos State government would not prosecute people who were involved in the cover-up. And we want to see how Lagos State Government will not prosecute the people who refused to appear before a judicial panel.\u201d\n\nPeterside also urged the Lagos State Ministry of Justice to rise up to its responsibility, pointing out that Nigeria will not change until people stand up and do the right thing. \u201cThe judicial panel has stood up and we must clap for them,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe governor of Lagos State must meet its own obligations and, like I told the youth during the #EndSARS, yes, you are angry and this judicial panel report might make you even angrier because the evidence is there that people were lying.\n\n\u201cBut that anger should be channelled at something and it should be channelled towards the next election which is in 15 months\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nFalana said, in a statement, that a certified copy of the report of the panel should be forwarded to President Muhammadu Buhari in view of the recommendation that the soldiers and police personnel who engaged in the torture and reckless murder of citizens be sanctioned.\n\nHe urged the Lagos State government to accelerate the issuance of the White Paper as well as the implementation of the far-reaching recommendations. The human rights activist also said the policemen who were killed by criminal elements during the protests should be honoured, notwithstanding that the Lagos State government had compensated their family members.\n\nHe stated, \u201cHowever, as police brutality has continued unabated, we call on the government to set up the Lagos State Human Rights Committee in line with the recommendation of the panel. This was part of the unanimous resolutions of the members of the National Economic Council (NEC).\u201d\n\nFalana commended the witnesses and their lawyers for exposing what he termed \u201cthe official cover-up of the egregious human rights abuse perpetrated by the merchants of death\u201d. He called on the Lagos State government to designate venues where aggrieved citizens could hold rallies in exercise of their fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and expression.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe violent attack of unarmed protesters during peaceful rallies by police and military personnel should be completely outlawed since Section 83 (4) of the Police Establishment Act, 2020 has imposed a duty on the police to provide adequate security for citizens who participate in peaceful meetings and rallies.\u201d\n\nBut the CDS said only a White Paper could for the basis for comment on the #EndSARS panel report. He assured, however, that the Nigerian Armed Forces remained committed to their professional calling of protecting the territorial integrity of the country. Irabor cautioned Nigerians against inciting comments on happenings across the country.\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after a courtesy visit to Governor Godwin Obaseki at Government House, Irabor said the operations of the armed forces should not be compared to that of the police, adding that his men and women remain professionals.\n\nIrabor, who was on a familiarisation visit to military formations in Edo State, said, \u201cI am sure those of you in the media must have seen that there is a report that was released, though, in my view, a wrong channel that is making the rounds in the social media.\n\n\u201cWhether it is a true report, I can\u2019t tell but I would like to indicate that the normal procedure is to have such a report submitted to the conventional authority and then there will be a White Paper based on which one can make informed comments.\n\n\u201cBut whatever you see currently, I will like to indicate that the armed forces of Nigeria is professional, we are peopled by Nigerians and we remain committed to constitutional mandates. So we do not at this point think that Nigerians should make disparaging remarks regarding the armed forces of Nigeria in the sense that we are professional armed forces and if there are issues, of course, we address them within the ambit of the provision.\n\n\u201cIt will not be right to disparage men and women who have worked so hard to ensure that the territorial integrity of this nation is kept intact. So in the meantime, until I see the full report, I may not be able to\u2026\n\n\u201cBut I can assure you that the armed forces of Nigeria are well disciplined and we do not engage in any ignoble acts.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians don\u2019t trust us, then we wouldn\u2019t have been doing what we are doing and in any case, it is the armed forces of Nigeria and remember, we are not talking about the police, we are talking about the armed forces, with emphasis, armed forces, so when the armed forces are called out, it is because there is a need for the armed forces; there is no one who do not require and desire to live in peace. We need to understand that the armed forces is there to keep the peace, to provide the ambience that will enable each and every Nigerian to live up to his desires in peace and harmony.\n\n\u201cLet us not make inciting comments that will put the entire space on fire, that is not right.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Obaseki lauded the CDS for his efforts at improving security in the country. Obaseki sought the collaboration and support of the defence chief in the effort to eliminate bandits and other criminals from Edo forests.\n\nThe governor told Irabor, \u201cYou are one person that we are very proud of; apart from being a well-decorated officer, in a short while, you have taken charge of the defense functions through your network. We have been watching with admiration the way you are coping and thriving with the very difficult challenge of stabilising the security of this country.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cWe have been able to record quite a lot of success in relation to what is going on in the rest of the country. We have some challenges and we would like you to support us. We are currently experiencing problems in some of our forests, particularly the Okomu axis, which borders the Ose River.\n\n\u201cWe find bandits and criminals coming there to undertake massive logging of woods and transport them; they now buy arms to reinforce their activities there. I am glad you came with all the men in the navy to see how you can give us additional support to patrol the waterways to checkmate the activities of these criminals.\u201d\n\nHe further noted, \u201cIn the last couple of weeks, we have found lifeless bodies in the forest, which is now a den for cultivation of cannabis. We would like to work with the military to root out these criminals.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure you that you can always count on us in Edo to help in working with you to stabilise the security situation in this country.\u201d\n\nCAPPA, in its statement, recounted that the panel sat for over a year before submitting its findings to the Lagos State government on November 15, after establishing the fact that the Nigerian Army, led by Lieutenant Colonel Bello, was at Lekki Gate on October 20, 2020, and further described the event of that day as a \u2018\u2019massacre in a context\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPart of the recommendations of the panel included that all men of the Nigerian Army, excluding Major General Omata, that were deployed to the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, should be made to face appropriate disciplinary action and, or stripped of their status and dismissed, while disciplinary actions should be taken against Major General Godwin Umelo and Lt. Col S.O. Bello, who refused to honour the summons of the panel in order to frustrate the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe panel indicted Nigerian Army officers of having \u2018shot\u2019, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenceless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the national anthem and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite an abundance of evidence which includes testimonials and visuals, the Nigerian government continued to deny that protesters were shot and killed. Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, even went as far as describing the Lekki incident as a \u2018phantom massacre\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn is reaction, CAPPA\u2019s Executive Director, Akinbode Oluwafemi said the events of October 20, 2020 were a sad commentary on the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe findings of the judicial panel that the Lagos State government received is what we confirmed long ago and documented in our report Lies and the Hail of Bullets.\u201d\n\nOluwafemi pointed out that in the face of undeniable atrocities perpetrated by Nigerian security forces the Nigerian government and their image-makers walked the lonely road of woeful denial, adding, \u201cwhat we are now demanding is justice for the victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report both in print and video documentary format was accompanied by a follow-up letter by CAPPA to the United Nations, office of the High Commissioner and the International Criminal Court, urging both bodies to act and investigate the incident.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NNPC Gets $1bn Boost from Afreximbank, Sees Oil at $100pb",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday signed a five-year agreement worth $1.04 billion with the African Export\u2013Import Bank (Afreximbank), in a deal that has been described as the biggest so far at the ongoing Intra-African Trade Fair in Durban, South Africa.\n\nThis is just as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari yesterday predicted that crude oil prices may hit $100 per barrel mark in the coming months as global inventory tightens and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) continues to resist pressure to pump more oil into the market.\n\nIn terms of the NNPC and Afreximbank deal, it was gathered that it did not involve exploration of crude oil, but mainly for trade financing and export of the crude produced by the national oil company, although details still remained sketchy last night.\n\nArise News Channel reported that the $1.04 billion would be repaid to the continental bank with about 25,000bpd of crude oil produced by the state oil company.\n\nIt quoted the President of the bank, Benedict Oramah, as saying that the deal would benefit Nigeria, promising to fund similar projects across Africa.\n\nThe bank also signed a $250 million contract with an aviation logistics company, Blue Horn, to fund the upgrading of three airports in Nigeria and another $270 deal for oil exploration activities with Mars E&P.\n\nThe Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2021) kicked off on 15th November with the the theme: \u201cBuilding Bridges for a successful AfCFTA\u201d, and has so far attracted thousands of visitors to the Durban International Convention Centre where it\u2019s taking place.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on Bloomberg Television, Kyari also raised doubts about the ability of the producers\u2019 group to ramp up production in the short term as investment in the industry continues to wane.\n\nOPEC has continued to stick with its agreed plan since July, to release an additional supply of 400, 000 barrels every month to gradually return the cuts it embarked upon in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, despite promptings from the United States, India, Japan and other countries to supply more barrels.\n\nCurrently, the global oil market has a deficit of over 600,000 bpd, a development that has led to increase in oil and gas prices and bringing along attendant inflationary pressures.\n\nDespite the over 1.6 million bpd allocated to Nigeria in September and October, the country was only to supply 1.399 million bpd and 1.354 million barrels in September and October respectively on the back of weak infrastructure and sabotage.\n\nSpeaking further, Kyari argued that the plan by the United States to release oil from its special reserves has to be very significant to make any long-term impact on global oil prices, explaining that although Nigeria has faltered in meeting its OPEC allocation, by the end of the year, the country may be able to hit 1.8 million bpd, excluding condensates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that by the close of the year, we will get back to the 1.7 barrels to 1.8 barrels per day of crude oil. When I mention this figure, I am only talking about crude oil because we also produce condensates and when you combine, we can easily hit 2.0 million barrels by the end of the year,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe GMD reiterated that Nigeria was hugely impacted by its inability to restart the oil facilities after the COVID-19-induced shutdowns, emphasising that with the fresh clarity around the fiscal environment with the introduction of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), more investments were being expected in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThe fact is very clear, during the covid-19 pandemic, we shut down some of these wells and they usually don\u2019t come back as early as we want them.\n\n\u201cRight now, we do have some challenges around the facilities and these are being taken care of. There\u2019s enormous work going on that will get us back before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere was some level of lack of clarity in our own fiscal environment and this is being sorted out by the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) . And the meaning of this is that we are seeing very good traction with our key partners in the deep offshore asset development,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nHe said the proposed release of the United States of oil from its special reserve could have some marginal impact on global oil prices, since supply is not matching demand, but added that the release has to be really significant to make any difference.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s going to dampen prices for a little while, but because demand is growing and several economies are recovering, it may not be enough or sufficient to create that change that we expect. That means that we still see a situation of $80 in time to come.\u201d Kyari said.\n\nProbed further, he noted that if a situation arises when the United States bans export of its crude, prices would likely remain in the $80s, but less than $100, adding that $100 was still within sight.\n\n\u201cThat is too ambitious. $200 is too ambitious. $100 looks like it, I don\u2019t see a situation of $100 plus in the short term,\u201d he stated.\n\nKyari stated that a number of issues, including financing, inability to quickly fill the oil supply deficit were responsible for OPEC\u2019s defiance of calls to raise output, saying that it may not be realisable in the short term to pump more oil and fix the existing spare capacity.\n\nOn gas , he said: Yes, we are supplying more gas to Europe, but we are definitely in short supply from LNG because there are a number of issues concerning our gas supply. This is improving and we are taking a number of steps to ensure full production of trains 1-6 of the LNG and focus on train 7.\n\n\u201d For 2022, I see some kind of decline in our ability to supply to the market, but this is being mitigated. I am not sure we will be able to do full catch-up by the end of the year, but clearly, the forecast is about 90 cargoes of LNG to be out of the market, but we are doing everything to bring that number below 58 and that will be quite possible and that means more supply to Europe.\u201d\n\nAs of 2020, an S&P Global document noted that Nigeria LNG exported around 300 cargoes of liquefied natural gas annually from the Bonny plant, representing about 40 per cent of global LNG supplies.\n\nIn the same vein, NLNG\u2019s 6-train LNG facility, which has been in operation since 1999, has delivered over 4,700 LNG cargoes around the world.\n\nKyari noted that the oil and gas industry continues to remain in a state of transition, explaining that gas will play a major role in the energy supply mix in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that the energy industry is in a huge transition. These are very exciting times. Countries are working very hard to meet the NetZero target in 2050, but some countries cannot make it as early as 2050. But obviously, the oil industry is adjusting, people are facing new realities and of course, the focus is changing.\n\n\u201cPeople are going for more gas development across the globe and also bringing on blue hydrogen. So much is happening and we as a national company see opportunities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Bandits Inform Adamawa Community Of Impending Attack, Demand N30million Upfront",
          "text": "Bandits have sent threats to the Fa'a Gaya community in the Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State demanding N30million ransom so that they would not invade and launch terror on the community.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from a save-our-soul call made to the government and civil societies that the bandits were on the heels of attacking the community.\n\n\n\nAn authoritative source noted that the villagers, living in fear and trepidation of the terror of bandits had gradually started to desert the community as efforts to get the intervention of security agencies have proved abortive.\n\nAccording to him, the bandits called initially with a phone number which was not registered and later called with another, traced to a name and location which the leaders provided the police but the police refused to launch an investigation into the matter.\n\nHe said, rather than investigate, the police instead detained a young man whom the bandits contacted initially.\n\nHe also stated that the police have since harassed community leaders who have gone to report to the police.\n\nHe said that the community is not far from Garaha, the village where the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, hails from.\n\n\u201cThe number of soldiers stationed at the SGF home can provide adequate security for the whole of Fa'a Gaya if the military are really interested in protecting people.\n\n\u201cKidnappers have threatened to wipe out one village called Fa'a Gaya in Hong LGA of Adamawa State.

          "text": "The report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution on Lekki Toll Gate shooting incident and cases of Police brutality as well as human rights violations has indicted the Nigerian Army and Police of complicity in the death of unarmed protesters at Lekki Toll Gate!\n\nIndeed, like I once opined, the bullet of the Oligarchy targeted at the youth fell our emperors of oppression and not the youth! The lies and propaganda that has sustained Buhari's hold on power met their water loo at the Lekki \"Freedom\" Gate!\n\nThe author, Dr Bolaji O. Akinyemi\n\nEndsars, a phenomenal movement of the Nigerian youth against bad governance started like a child's play with an # tag campaign online, it became the rallying point of the youthful oppressed demography of Nigerian populace, the age bracket between 18 and 35 who apparently hold the ace of our political game but have never put it to use. Their capacity to fund to power any candidate of their choice has been proven by the commitment to Big Brother Naija. They will be later known as \"Soro soke generation\", having demanded of the Governor to raise his voice during one of their engagements with him while the protest was on going!\n\nFed up with the hostilities and harassments their peers were subjected to by Security Agents, they chose to bring their exasperations to the attention of the global Community. For whatever reasons, like a revolution in its time, every known tactics that has stopped such protests in the past failed!\n\nThe fear of Government was later revealed when Muhammadu accused them of wanting to overthrow his Government, hence they were dealt with like coup plotters!\n\nThe unfortunate incident was followed by series of denials, not a single tier of Government nor their agency involved took responsibility!\n\nMemory of the blood stained flag of the massacre was renewed at the first anniversary, with Nigerian youths and their parent promising never to forget!\n\nHanging in the balance however is what the truth of the whole scenario will be based on the findings of the Panel. Lekki will now remain a date of gory in the annals of citizens' right to peaceful protests in Nigeria, a day of blood when youths with Nigerian flags in their hands, singing the National Anthem were shot at by the Army. Who commanded this carnage is the question on every lip, though we are yet to find an answer, not even from the commander in chief of the armed forces, who later indirectly admitted he ordered the army to shoot down coup plotters!\n\nThe report was presented on the day the former Governor of Lagos State, now Minister of Works, Babatunde Raji Fashola, who came to the scene of the massacre, dramatically to remove the video of the footage irresponsibly admitted that he couldn't remember where he kept the tape thus confirming the conclusion of the Panel that attempts were made to hamper her findings by the officials of LCC (Lekki Concession Company), who were basically excitatory at turning over some useful and vital information/evidence as requested by the Panel and Forensic experts engaged by the Panel, even where such information and evidences were by the company's admission, available!\n\nIt manipulated the incomplete CCTV video footage of the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of October 20, 2020, which it tendered before the Panel!\n\nPolice brutality has become part of official dealing of policing in Nigeria through an arm of the force Known as Special Anti-Robbery Squad, (SARS), They kill and maim at will!\n\nThis arm of the police seems to have disdain for young Nigerians! Being a youth was practically a crime to this unit of the police!\n\nTrendy look, fashionable hair styles, good cars are enough reasons to brutalise any young person without regard for gender. Cases of rapes of young girls are traumatic memories of this unit of the Nigeria police force!\n\nIn this tech driving world where data is life and internet presence is key to influence in whatever you are involved in legally, it is practically impossible to be a student without owning a laptop! It is to them in learning today what hardcover note book was to us in our days back in school, but the SARS arm of the police wouldn't see nice phones, i-pads and laptops with young people, they will automatically criminalise them!\n\nThis situation was what the Endsars was meant to address, when Nigerian youths got together and rose in unison to say enough is enough!\n\nThey protested the continued harassment of their peers by government!\n\nThe Endsars movement symbolises a generation to which Nigerians must look in hope of freedom from oppressive political class and their bad Governance. They are a people among us who have risen above ethno-religious sentiments that the political class always plough to harvest our votes!\n\nThey are young but determined to reorder the fixed sequence of events in favour of the people against the status quo of elites' benefits!\n\nAt Lekki Toll Gate they spoke loud and clear on the need for young people to exercise their civic and political rights against injustice and demanded reform of Government policies that will guarantee good Governance and better life for all citizens!\n\nPanel's Report gave recognition to the potential of the Nigerian youth and the emerging leadership they constitute going forward to 2023!\n\nDevelopment of more robust engagements with the youth, the Panel recommended, they must also be apologised to publicly for the killing, injury inflicted on them and trauma they were subjected to and of course the memorialisation of Lekki Toll Gate, which for me should be Lekki Freedom Gate!\n\nThe youth for me won when the Panel demanded for an holistic Police Reform covering welfare, training and proper equiping of policemen and their work environment, my mind went to the baby and the bath water of police equipment fund thrown out of the window with Obasanjo without a batting of our eyelids!\n\nSanctioning of the officers of the Nigerian Army and Police officers respectively who participated in shooting, injuring and killing of unarmed protesters waving national flag and singing our anthem is sacrosanct in the spirit of patriotism to the nation and justice to victims!\n\nBeyond biases for Tinubu is the protocol of jurisprudence that can't join him in matters he is not officially privy to, many may angry that his name didn't surface on the indictment list of the Panel. Sanwo-Olu is the elected Governor of Lagos State, and Buhari is the President of Nigeria. The duo are answerable to us in this matter. The law has no sentiments and I will advise us to tow the path of law in our future engagement with Tinubu!\n\nFacts, we all must push in our political engagements, same, we must encourage all Nigerians in our circle of influence to embrace!\n\nMay the wishes of Nigerian youths for a systemic society where things work and all can be free to express themselves, contribute their creativities and live their dreams come to pass!\n\nNow is time for the youths to get together and organize themselves within the ambit of the law like they did for the Endsars to lead the movement for the abolishment of 1999 constitution and end the nightmare of bad Governance! To the youths I commend us in the search for a new Nigeria!\n\nDr Bolaji O. Akinyemi is an Apostle and Nation Builder, BID as fondly called is an agent of change his massages are revival and revolution focused.",

          "title": "Jumia records all-time high quarterly orders and unveils its fintech ambition",
          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This week, Africa Health Holdings, a healthcare startup that operates 40 medical facilities across three countries in Africa, said it has secured $18 million Series A funding.\n\nThe funding round was led by Asia Pacific Land and Natural World Limited, with the participation of a number of investors including TRB Advisors, Breyer Capital, M3, Inc., Valiant Capital, Kepple Ventures, and SUNU Capital. According to the startup, it has raised a total of $21 million in funding so far.\n\nAfrica Health Holdings plans to deploy the funds towards building its \u201ctech-forward healthcare system\u201d across the continent. Specifically, it intends to expand its telemedicine service beyond Ghana to Nigeria and Kenya, and scale its network of health facilities.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sangu Delle, Africa Health Holdings operates in all three African countries under three brands: Meridian Health Group (in Kenya), Rabito Clinic Ltd (in Ghana), and Care Point Hospitals Ltd (in Nigeria).\n\nDelle is a Harvard and Oxford graduate, a TED Fellow, World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, and also the former CEO of Golden Palm Investments, an investment holding company with an interest in early-stage opportunities in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe founding of Africa Health Holdings was inspired by the need to \u201caddress Africa\u2019s disproportionate share of the global disease burden.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Ghana, Delle witnessed the challenges that everyday Ghanaians faced in trying to access quality healthcare: from proximity to medical facilities, availability of doctors and nurses, access to the right medical equipment, prescriptions, and more.\n\n\u201cMy father, a doctor, would often take time away from his private practice to do human rights work, providing healthcare to refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis all had a lasting impact, making me interested above all else, in changing healthcare for the better, across the continent.\u201d\n\nDelle\u2019s first efforts aimed at improving healthcare in Africa came through Golden Palm Investments (GPI). As the former CEO of GPI, he and his team began making healthcare investments in 2010 and piloted the model for how technology could be leveraged to expand access to healthcare while increasing affordability. In 2017, Delle took his learnings from all the healthcare investments he lead at GPI and founded Africa Health Holdings.\n\nSangu Delle, founder and CEO of Africa Health Holdings. Image credit: HBS Alumni\n\nIn addition to its medical facilities, Africa Health Holdings operates pharmacies and labs throughout each of the countries, to provide its patients with requisite medications and lab results. In all, it serves more than 200,000 patients annually.\n\nA telemedicine mobile platform, MyCareMobile, connects each of the startup\u2019s brands. The app is said to provide patients with access to services through teleconferencing, including medical consultations, access to test results, and 24-hour emergency response.\n\nAs mobile penetration increases in Africa, MyCareMobile helps reduce in-person visits by allowing virtual follow-up consultations with doctors and nurses.\n\n\u201cOur online and offline care model allows our patients to access care anytime, anywhere,\u201d Delle said. \u201cWe are keeping healthcare costs affordable while broadening the availability of quality healthcare in the countries we operate in.\u201d\n\nMeridian has a total of 16 medical facilities\u201412 providing outpatient services and inpatient health services in Kenya, three hospitals, and a drug and alcohol recovery centre.\n\nRabito has a chain of 21 dermatology and general medical facilities, located throughout Ghana while Care Point has two hospitals and one clinic in Nigeria.\n\nThe next global healthcare frontier\n\nOn Monday, Nigeria-based DrugStoc also announced a $4.4 million Series A fundraising round, led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund, with participation from Vested World and German Development Bank.\n\nDrugStoc is focused on the medical supply chain and operates a digital platform that helps healthcare providers access pharmaceutical and healthcare products. It plans to expand its tech beyond Lagos by investing in cold chain infrastructure and building on its partnerships.\n\nThese developments reflect the growth of West Africa\u2019s digital health market as the sector attracts global investors. And according to Delle, the African continent, as a whole, is the next global frontier for healthcare.\n\n\u201cOur population is projected to grow by an additional 1 billion people by 2050, and 1 out of every 4 people in the world will be African,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will no longer allow past narratives of infectious, preventable diseases to continue to define Africa, our people, and our future.\u201d\n\nIn addition to expanding its footprint within the countries it currently operates within, Africa Health Holdings plans to expand to the Northern and Southern parts of Africa, in line with a grand vision to become \u201cthe biggest healthcare provider in Africa\u201d.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s financial services industry has been exploding in 2021. Payments, digital lending, and savings companies have become popular with investors looking to take a slice of Nigeria\u2019s fintech market.\n\nConsequently, looking at Nigeria\u2019s financial services space will reveal several startups with diverse financial use cases. But for the founders of digital banking startup, Kredi Money, financial services consumers could receive a better experience.\n\nBetween 2005 to 2009, Afolabi Abimbola, CEO of Kredi Money, first plied his trade as a Sales Manager for Globacom, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost telecom companies. In 2010, he became a Business Development Manager at Funds and Electronic Transfer Solutions (FETS) Limited, a pioneer of mobile payments in Nigeria.\n\nHe then held management-level positions at Renmoney, a prominent microfinance bank and digital lender, and Director-level positions at and OPay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArmed with these experiences, Abimbola began to observe gaps in the financial services industry he aimed to close.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the average consumer in Nigeria uses a separate app for borrowing, another one for saving, and another one for investing. In some cases, some use a particular platform for the purpose of making payments only,\u201d Abimbola says.\n\nHe then brought on Samuel Orji, a legal professional and seasoned investment professional, as co-founder. His most recent position is with a US-based emerging markets-focused VC investor, where he has been responsible for leading fintech investments across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKredi money was pretty much the brainchild of their combined experiences in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Left to Right: Samuel Orji, Co-founder Kredi Money, and Afolabi Abimbola, CEO of Kredi Money. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cThe early foundations for Kredi started being laid in early 2021. Over the past few months, we have been building our fully-digitised bank (Kredi Bank) in stealth.\u201d\n\nThey built Kredi Money to provide solutions across five financial areas: Savings, Spending, Investing, Borrowing (Loans), and protection (Insurance) for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) and individuals at the mid-bottom of the pyramid.\n\n\u201cWe aim to be a one-stop-shop for financial solutions and be a welcome break from the current fragmented solutions that characterises the market. We currently serve users primarily through our apps (Kredi) available on the Android and iOS stores.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are developing a diverse suite of products that would enable us to reach users via multiple channels including web and offline through agents.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Abimbola, after executing the pilot phase that saw the company gain over 8,000 users across the country, it is now poised for a full launch.\n\nBuilding in a highly competitive market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi will be entering a space currently dominated by traditional financial services companies, digital banks, and payments companies, but its unique offering seems to be catching on with its users.\n\nIts competitors include commercial banks, neobanks like Kuda, Sparkle, Carbon, Fairmoney, and companies like Branch playing in the micro-lending space.\n\nSide Note: Both Carbon and Fairmoney started as micro-lending companies before making the transition to digital banking.\n\nInterestingly, three of these neobanks \u2014 Kuda, Fairmoney, Sparkle \u2014 have raised a combined $125 million in 2021 alone, signifying investor confidence in digital banking, not unlike other parts of the globe.\n\nBesides bringing a one-stop-shop for the entire spectrum of financial services, Abimbola believes Kredi\u2019s focus on the mid to lower market, which has a fatter tail, is a significant advantage.\n\nWhile major Neobanks have either followed a payment driven model or a credit led model, Kredi\u2019s core business model is similar to that of other banks; mobilise deposits and then invest and issue loans.\n\nRemarkably, Abimbola points out that the business has witnessed strong growth in fees from its B2B component.\n\n\u201cWe are also leveraging our robust payment experience and expertise to provide API-based payment infrastructure services to fellow fintech startups that are either not fully licensed or don\u2019t have the technology to carry out mass payments,\u201d he explains.\n\nAbimbola also affirms that Kredi\u2019s payments arm has generated substantial revenues, and it\u2019s currently growing really fast.\n\nKredi\u2019s growing pains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi has only been in existence for a few months. Most of it has been spent setting up the groundwork for the business.\n\n\u201cWe only just kicked off our pilot phase. However, we have grown quite well. We have already exceeded $10,000 in monthly revenue and processed over $2.4 million. We expect to break into profitability in the next couple of months,\u201d Abimbola says.\n\nAccording to Abimbola, Kredi currently has over 8500 users, and about 65% (5,525) are monthly active users. The company defines these as people who conduct at least three transactions on the platform each month.\n\n\u201cWorthy of note that we got these numbers in our pilot phase, without any marketing spend. Major partners on the B2B side of things include Crowdyvest, Youverify and Chipper Cash. We have a strong pipeline of B2B partners lined up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi\u2019s growth in a short space of time has not been without its fair share of challenges.\n\nA recurring trend among budding tech entrepreneurs we\u2019ve featured in the last few years has been the difficulty of securing talent. Kredi was not an exception in this instance.\n\n\u201cAs with any startup, it\u2019s never an easy ride to get people to buy into your dream early on. But we have been extremely lucky to have come across some amazing folks who chose to go on this journey with us,\u201d Abimbola reveals.\n\nHe also says that the company has maintained a healthy workplace culture for its talented team.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that we are building an atmosphere that encourages openness, intellectual curiosity and empathy. There\u2019s still a long way to go, but we are excited for what the future holds on this front.\u201d\n\nFuture growth and expansion plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, Kredi Money has been largely bootstrapped to date with some support from Angel investors. Abimbola reveals that he wanted to lay the groundwork for a financial services company, before approaching institutional investors.\n\n\u201cWe have secured all the required licenses from the relevant regulators. We got to 8,000 users without any marketing spend. Customers clearly like our product. And we have big-name players looking to partner with us. We are at an inflection point in our growth and we are looking to scale this up.\u201d\n\nThe company is currently on the verge of opening a pre-seed round, and the founder says that investors are interested, clearly amazed by the traction the company has built without external funding.\n\n\u201cThis fundraise is exclusively for the purpose of driving growth and scaling up the business. This contrasts sharply with the practice in the industry where a significant chunk of initial fundraising is typically channelled towards securing licenses,\u201d Abimbola avers.\n\nIn the short term, the company is focused on growing its customer base in Nigeria and rolling out new products to serve customers of other banks. One of such products is \u201cTrickle\u201d.\n\nThough Abimbola didn\u2019t explain in much detail, Trickle will be a multibank savings and investment platform that would enable users save and invest while they spend.\n\nIn the medium term, a continental expansion seems to be in the works.\n\n\u201cRwanda would be our first destination; we already have arrangements for a licence there in the pipelines. We have also identified a few other markets, some in Francophone Africa others in Southern Africa.\u201d\n\nLast year, our trend analysis of Nigeria\u2019s fintech sector using insights from McKinsey and PwC, revealed that fintechs have largely focused on people already in the banking sector, and rarely released products to bring people into the financial sector.\n\nThis, however, reveals that there\u2019s still much room for growth.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish about this space. We believe that the current players have only scratched the surface and there is opportunity for innovation to go deeper and broader.\u201d Abimbola asserts.\n\nKredi\u2019s work might just turn out to be a first of many other companies looking to broaden the scope of digital banking in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

Meme coins are crypto tokens inspired by social media trends, jokes, or movies. Currently, there are over 250 meme coins, including SHIBA INU and Dogecoin.\n\nThe latest in line is Wakanda Inu, named after the fictional African city, Wakanda, in the movie Black Panther. Aside from original gangster (OG) meme coins, most meme coins have no use case backing them, which makes trading in them a risky venture.\n\nFor the latest instalment of Crypto Explorer, our Reporter, Bolu Abiodun, goes into detail about meme coins.

Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Shuttlers has raised $1.6 million in seed funding. VestedWorld led the round with participation from Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Sakore and Nikky Taurus.\n\nNigeria\u2019s most populous city, Lagos, is notorious for its chaotic traffic situation, leaving visitors perplexed. After moving to the city from Ibadan, Damilola Olokesusi, Shuttlers\u2019 founder, was initially shielded from it as her workplace provided a staff bus. That changed after she left the job.\n\nA trip abroad in 2014 caused her to experience efficient transportation options and lit a fire in her. In 2017, she founded Shuttlers with some friends, all of whom are no longer with the company. Since its inception, the company has been bootstrapped except for some funding from family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, with other players in the space, like Treepz (previously known as Plentywaka), raising money and expanding, the startup has raised money to scale across Africa.\n\nWith this round of funding, the company plans to accelerate its expansion into other African cities. Already there are plans to launch in Abuja, with other cities set to follow. In addition, it would be ramping up its hiring process with an eye to improve its technology offerings.\n\nMuch of Africa\u2019s transportation sector is fragmented. However, a few startups are springing up to digitise the process.\n\nIn recent times, startups like Shuttlers, Treepz, and SWVL have seen sufficient interest from investors, signalling an acceptance that the sector is ripe for disruption.\n\nDrugStoc\u2019s Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DrugStoc team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nNigerian healthcare startup, DrugStoc, has closed a Series A funding of $4.4 million. The round was led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund (AAIC) with other investors, including VestedWorld, the German Development Bank (DEG), and several high-net-worth individuals.\n\nChibuzo Opara and Adham Yehia founded DrugStoc in 2015 to link drug companies with hospitals and pharmacies in Nigeria. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly worked with over 3,000 healthcare facilities to serve about 14 million people.\n\nFollowing the completion of its Series A, the startup is set to embark on an ambitious expansion plan that would see it expand its operations to 16 states apart from Lagos, where it currently operates, after which it plans to expand into other African countries.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we intend to expand beyond the 14 million we currently serve to cover just around 100 million people. And this would be achieved by expanding to about 16 states. Once we are done with the heavy lifting from that expansion, we will be training our sights on other countries,\u201d Opara said.\n\nOver the next few years, the company plans to invest heavily in last-mile delivery while building partnerships with financial institutions.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing deficit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Nigeria has a housing deficit of about 22 million homes. Available data shows that this deficit grew the most between 2007 and 2015.\n\nFollowing the Federal Government\u2019s unveiling of the country\u2019s housing portal, we take a look at how the housing deficit has fared since 1991.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nA deep dive into the activities of PoS agents in Nigeria.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current surge in the price of cryptocurrencies (bull run) is perhaps one of the most exciting in the crypto market in recent times. Things started with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) recording incredible numbers in the first quarter of 2021, with as much as $10 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter.\n\nNews of all-time highs floods the media, with some people doubling or even 23x their earnings, making mind-boggling amounts of money in a short amount of time.\n\nIn addition to unbelievable earnings, the rise of meme coins is another unique thing about this current bull run.\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t the first time meme coins are popping up, but it\u2019s safe to say that this is the first time we\u2019re seeing them in this magnitude. In fact, the first African themed meme coin, Wakanda Inu, has just been launched. But what are these meme coins, and are they worth the hype?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are meme coins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Old Money on Unsplash\n\nMeme coins are related to memes, those funny videos, pictures, or texts that reference a particular social or cultural phenomenon. The trending \u201cI wan dey do now\u201d is an excellent example.\n\nIn simple terms, meme coins are crypto tokens inspired by social media trends, jokes, or movies.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 250 meme coins, including Dodgelon Mars, Safemoon Inu, SHIBA INU, SHIBAVAX, Loser Coin, Rotten, and DogeZilla.\n\nFrom their names, it\u2019s possible to tell what some meme coins stand for.\n\nAlthough there are hundreds of meme coins, those referred to as OG (original gangster) meme coins are the most popular with the highest market capitalisation.\n\nThe biggest OG is Dogecoin, the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation of $35.6 billion.\n\nSHIBA INU, which has been touted as the Dogecoin killer, is the second biggest with a market capitalisation of $28.29 billion, sitting two places below Dogecoin.\n\nInterestingly there\u2019s now an African-themed meme coin \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 made to create wealth for Africans. Currently ranked 2818 with a market cap of $26.8 million, Wakanda Inu is far from being an OG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Clay Banks on Unsplash\n\nHowever, supporters of the token are bullish about its growth, despite its ranking, with many claiming to have made a lot of money from the token.\n\nWhile meme tokens might be a product of social media trends with no fundamental use case backing them, they have recorded enormous growth and made their hodlers a lot of money.\n\nSide note: Hodl is a crypto term derived from misspelling \u2018hold\u2019; it also means \u2018holding on for dear life\u2019. It is a strategy where a coin is held for the long term for higher gains.\n\nHowever, investing in them still poses risks.\n\nMeme coins might make you a lot of money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Crystal Mapes on Unsplash\n\nSome people, like Glauber Contessoto, aka Slumdoge Millionaire, who became a millionaire with Dogecoin, have publicly revealed how much they\u2019ve made from meme coins.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, he invested $250,000 in Dogecoins when a unit was worth $0.045 (4.5 cents). He became a millionaire two months later, on April 15, 2021. Contessoto told CBNC that he invested because of the strong community behind Dogecoin and Elon Musk\u2019s backing of the coin.\n\nThe Doge Millionaire believes that the coin will build him generational wealth.\n\nHowever, he lost his millionaire status after the value of Dogecoin decreased. Nevertheless, Contessoto remains bullish about the meme coin, refusing to sell and even more.\n\nDogecoin isn\u2019t the only meme coin making people millionaires. SHIBA INU also has its millionaires.\n\nAccording to Fortune, a man identified simply as Rob made an $8,000 bet on SHIBA INU and immediately retired after earning a million dollars on his bet.\n\nCNN also told the story of two brothers \u2014 Tommy and James \u2014 who invested in the Dogecoin killer and made a killing from it. The brothers also convinced other family members to invest in the coin. Before long, the family\u2019s $7,900 investment was worth almost $9 million.\n\nIn October, SHIBA INU was able to unseat Dogecoin as the biggest OG in the meme coin universe, gaining nearly 900,000,000% since it was created in August 2020.\n\nWhile meme coins have made people overnight millionaires, that is not always the case.\n\nYou can lose a lot of money with meme coins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Nairametrics\n\nThe release of the Korean hit series Squid Game, in September, was the beginning of another massive Internet trend. The series became Netflix\u2019s biggest hit show, with over 130 million watches globally in October.\n\nThe record-breaking series made headlines, inspiring a lot of viral content in the process.\n\nThe series also spurred a meme token \u2014 the SQUID Token \u2014 that took advantage of all the noise the hit series created.\n\nThe timing was perfect, and the coin took off because Squid Game was perhaps the most popular thing on the Internet at the time\n\nAccording to the coin\u2019s whitepaper, it was built just like the series. It contained several games to be played by coin hodlers; however, instead of playing for their lives, hodlers played to earn coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series: Sqid Game. Source: BBC\n\nThe rise of the SQUID token was meteoric; it got a lot of attention and made headlines, increasing its popularity and the rally behind it.\n\nAn October 28, 2021, CNBC headline read, There\u2019s a \u2018Squid Game\u2019 cryptocurrency \u2013 and it\u2019s up nearly 2,400% in the last 24 hours.\n\nIt was a juicy coin and everyone wanted in on the action until the creators switched from green lights to red and decided it was time to cash out.\n\nAccording to WIRED, the media failed to point out that there were no ties between the Squid Game Netflix series and the coin.\n\nThe coin went from less than a dollar to $600 per coin, and many hodlers saw themselves as theoretical millionaires. The reality, however, was that they just partook in a huge two-week-long scam.\n\nThe hodlers of the coin couldn\u2019t sell it, which meant they had no way to liquidate their earnings if the price of the token fell. Although the red flags were all too evident, it was already too late to do anything.\n\nThe creators dumped their hodlings, bringing the token, which reached a value of about $2,860 per token in less than two weeks, to almost zero.\n\nPerpetrators of the \u2018rug pull\u2019 scam were estimated to have made away with at least $3.9 million, according to BscScan.\n\nAlthough scams like this paint meme coins in a bad light, the continued existence of Dogecoin and SHIBA INU signals that they might not all be out to get you broke, but how can you tell?\n\nNew meme coins are constantly being created, and it\u2019s getting increasingly hard to differentiate what\u2019s real from what\u2019s not. For example, the new African-themed meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu \u2014 named after a fictional African city \u2014 Wakanda \u2014 in the movie the Black Panther is on the rise and rallying strongly.\n\nAlthough the token has the backing of popular Nigerian crypto trader and tutor, Chris Ani, the crypto market is notoriously volatile, and even well-meaning meme coins might not fly.\n\nThe African meme token \u2014 Wakanda Inu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWakanda Inu home page\n\nAccording to the token\u2019s whitepaper, \u201cWakanda Inu is a community meme project forged from the deep and warm consciousness of humanity.\u201d\n\nIt says it is \u201ca decentralized meme token to drive growth in the industry, decentralized finance-oriented activities across the world.\n\nBe a pioneer on this mission. Wakanda Inu will outperform every meme coin out there. We are well on our way to inevitable widespread adoption.\u201d\n\nThe whitepaper also reveals that the token will drive charity oriented activities across the world.\n\nAs a community-driven token, the public will decide what happens with the token and which projects to embark upon.\n\nIt is simply a token created to enrich Africans through their collective efforts.\n\nWhile Wakanda Inu means well for Africans, one of the most crucial points to look out for in a token is utility which it doesn\u2019t seem to have yet.\n\nAccording to Mint, experts believe that rather than communities, a token should be backed by fundamentals, also known as utilities or use cases.\n\nFor example, many protocols have been built on the Ethereum network because it has the technology to help NFTs and DeFi, among others, work.\n\nMeme tokens, on the other hand, exist because of a trend and grow in value as long as more people buy and hodl it.\n\nSidharth Sogani, Founder and CEO of Crebaco Global, a crypto and blockchain-focused research, rating, and intelligence company, says meme coins \u201care just community tokens. These are pump and dump coins, which don\u2019t have any use cases.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dogecoin, which started as a meme coin, is working on a use case.\n\nAccording to Market Insider, the American movie theatre could start accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment.\n\nThe SHIBA INU whitepaper has also shown that the token\u2019s ecosystem will contain ShibaSwap, a DeFi platform that will facilitate crypto trading.\n\nWakanda Inu\u2019s whitepaper states that a DeFi platform or NFT farming staking platform could be in the works depending on what the community chooses to build.\n\nHowever, the token is still entirely dependent on the community to grow any form of value.\n\nIn addition to use cases, a YouTuber, Mentoraa\u2019s World, pointed out other red flags within the Wakanda Inu infrastructure.\n\nHe discovered an address that held 8.6775% of the Wakanda Inu token. According to the YouTuber, no wallet address is supposed to be holding up to 4% of a particular token. If the address decides to dump the token, it could adversely affect its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWallets holding Wakanda Inu on BscScan\n\nHe analysed the token with Token Sniffer, a website that analyses the risk level of a token, and it was ranked highly risky.\n\nThere were also anomalies within the token\u2019s source code that could allow the transfer of the tokens to be halted. This means hodlers might not be able to transfer the token.\n\nHowever, the analysis by the website is experimental and isn\u2019t 100% accurate.\n\nIt is important to note that crypto tokens have become increasingly easy to make, increasing the probability of encountering scam tokens.\n\nTherefore, adequate research is necessary before investing in crypto, especially meme coins.\n\nAs the rally behind Wakanda Inu grows, time is perhaps the only factor that can reveal where it is headed.\n\nDisclaimer: The contents of this article are not financial advice.

          "text": "The number of Nigerian students seeking admission in US universities dipped by 6.5 percent in 2020/2021, the lowest in three years, a BusinessDay analysis of new admission data shows.\n\nAccording to the Open Doors Report, published by the Washington-based Institute of International Education (IIE), the enrolment rate from Nigeria declined to 12,860 in the 2020/21 academic year from 13,762; 13,423, and 12,693 in 2019/20, 2018/19 and 2017/18 academic year, respectively.\n\nAnalysts attribute the decline to foreign exchange (FX) scarcity and difficulty in sourcing FX, thus making tuition fees expensive.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising because the difficulty in sourcing for FX, volatility in the exchange rate, and uncertainty that persists in the exchange rate environment have made it too difficult to pay school fees,\u201d Moses Ojo, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says.\n\nOjo states that over the past three years, there have been quite a few parents who have withdrawn their children studying in the US and other countries, and enrolling them into Nigeria\u2019s private universities.\n\nSince the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa\u2019s biggest economy that depends on oil proceeds has been riddled with weak foreign inflows, resulting in a liquidity challenge in the country\u2019s FX market.\n\nLast year, the Central Bank of Nigeria devalued the naira twice from N306/$ to N361/$, and N379/$, weakening the value of the naira against the dollar.\n\nMore recently, the apex bank officially adopted the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange (NAFEX) rate, which further weakened the naira by 8.2 percent to N410.25/$.\n\nWith the rising cost of dollars, it has become expensive to study in the US. International students pay between $32,000 and $60,000 per year, depending on the university and the course, according to International Education Financial Aid.\n\nRead also: SI-UK Nigeria to facilitate on spot offers into UK Universities\n\n\u201cWhen the FX rate is going up, it means that the ability of people to afford it reduces. So, school fees are now becoming more expensive for people to afford,\u201d Ayodele Akinwunmi, senior relationship manager \u2013 corporate banking group, FSDH Merchant Bank, states.\n\nThe report also states that globally, Nigeria moved up by one place, ranking 10th position from its previous ranking of 11th among the countries with the highest number of students in America, while China, India, South Korea, Canada and Saudi Arabia are the top five countries.\n\nBefore the drop, the number of Nigerian students studying in the US has increased steadily since the 2011/2012 academic year from 7,028 to 13,762 in 2019/20.\n\nEducation experts say this steady increase in the outflow of Nigerian students seeking post-secondary education abroad is due to the failure of Nigeria\u2019s public university system to adequately address multiple problems such as access, quality, funding, strikes, cultism, and stability of the academic calendar.\n\n\u201cThe simple answer that I have is that people will go for value no matter the cost because they can afford it. Nigeria has many rich people who can afford American education for their children. If we fail to provide value at home, people will go out for it,\u201d Akin Benjamin, a Lagos-based education consultant, says in a phone interview.\n\nHe adds, \u201cIf you can send your child to a private university in Nigeria, chances are that you can afford education abroad as well.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, budgetary allocation to education has not been more than 7 percent of its total budget. It is no wonder that the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said the country has 13 million children out of school, the highest in the world.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s performance in human capital development has not been impressive. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the country dropped three positions, ranking 161 in 2019 from 158 in 2018 among 189 countries in Human Development.\n\n\u201cThe education sector is facing the problem of incompetent teachers and unserious students. It is also facing the problem of dilapidated infrastructure,\u201d Peter Okebukola, former executive secretary of the National Universities Commission, said.\n\nInternational student mobility data are crucial to the world\u2019s largest economy\u2019s higher education professionals looking to make informed decisions as they work to internationalise their campuses.\n\nThey enrich the US universities and communities with unique perspectives and experiences that expand the horizons of American students and make US institutions more competitive in the global economy.",

          "title": "#EndSARS panel report: How the army covered up massacre",
          "text": "The Rules of Engagement for armies allow the use of lethal force only as a means of last resort.\n\nOn October 20, 2020, the Nigerian Army opened fire on peaceful protesters sitting in front of the Lekki Toll Gate, killing scores of young people in violation of military rule and norms of decency.\n\nThe Rules of Engagement also state that after the shooting has ceased, medical assistance must be rendered.\n\nOn that day, the Nigerian Army packed the dead and dying into their trucks, picked up bullet casings of discharged cartridges and scrubbed the scene of the shooting to hide the evidence of their crime.\n\nThese were some of the chilling accounts uncovered by the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry into the massacre that occurred on October 20, 2020, in Lagos led by Doris Okuwobi, a retired high court judge.\n\n\u201cThe army in the circumstances of their engagement did not comply with their own Rules of Engagement in the conduct of their operation at the Lekki Toll Gate on the night of 20th October 2020,\u201d the panel report said.\n\nAccording to the panel, if the army had complied with its own rules, a single shot need not have been fired to persuade the unarmed and defenceless youth to leave the Lekki Toll Gate in preparation for the commencement of the declared curfew by the state government in the evening (9pm) of October 20, 2020.\n\nLong used to treating its civilian populace like the spoils of war, the Nigerian Army officers turned their guns on protesters guaranteed a right to peaceful protests by the Constitution the soldiers swore to uphold.\n\nAfter a sustained agitation since October 8, the #EndSARS protests had morphed into a movement. First of its kind in the history of civil disobedience in Nigeria, the movement lacked central coordination, leadership was organic and fluid, it was organised in its chaos, and cohesive in its fragmentation but its message was coherent, simple and clear: Disband SARS!\n\nDonations procured food and water; the unruly were picked up and handed over to the police, the protesters even cleaned up after themselves.\n\nIn a country where over 20 million young people are without jobs, where poverty is endemic and the government is blundering, a rogue police unit preying on defenceless youths was more than they could bear.\n\nIn response to the protests, the government offered tokenism, it will set up more panels, announced the disbandment of SARS, but these were things the protesters had heard before, lies they had grown inured to. It was not going to cut it, which meant the protests were not going away soon.\n\nSo, the Lagos State government having tried moral suasion and failed sought help from the Nigerian Army, who mobilised from the 65th Battalion, led by Colonel Bello in seven military trucks and arrived at the scene at 18:51:14hrs.\n\nIn trying to justify the deployment of the Army, its principal witness before the Panel, Brigadier-General Taiwo, said, \u201cOnce a protest goes past 2-3 days, it will be hijacked by hoodlums.\u201d\n\nThere was well-documented evidence of brigandage following the protests. Shopping malls in Lagos and Surulere were looted, public transport buses were razed, police stations were ransacked and some policemen were killed by mobs. Even a television station in Lagos was vandalised.\n\nBut not at the Lekki Toll Gate: The #EndSARS protest at Lekki Toll Gate in particular was peaceful and orderly and was not hijacked by hoodlums, the panel held.\n\n\u201cSo, there was no need for any apprehension on the part of the government or the security agencies to seek to dispel that peaceful assembly, with soldiers bearing lethal weapons,\u201d the panel said.\n\nThe only other logical explanation for unleashing the army at the Lekki Toll Gate comes down to economic considerations. Media reports quoting government estimates put the value of returns from the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge at N10 million daily, while the Lekki toll plaza at N16.6 million a day. For a state that operates a renter system, government departments double as revenue-generating agencies, money provides a motivation to unleash the soldiers on the people.\n\nThe army had earlier claimed that protesters pelted them with stones and had been forced to use blank bullets. Video evidence and medical reports from Reddington Hospital disproved these claims. The army had tried to persuade the protesters to leave and when they refused, they fired into them. General Taiwo, who gave testimony at the tribunal, was not at the scene rendering his testimony hearsay.\n\n\u201cHis failure to present the commanding officer Lt. Colonel Bello, who was on ground and Brigadier General Omata, who later joined him at the Lekki Toll Gate, is fatal to his account of what actually happened on the night of the 20th October 2020,\u201d the panel found.\n\nThe panel said the video evidence of the LCC and those of Serah Ibrahim showed the soldiers were shooting in the air and at some times directly at the protesters. Both accounts of the Forensic Experts and the Ballistic expert support the evidence of Serah Ibrahim and other witnesses, the report said.\n\nAccording to the report, the evidence of Reddington Hospital and Grandville Hospital established that about 20 persons who claimed to be protesters were treated for wounds consistent with gunshot injuries.\n\nOne of the protesters who was shot and taken for dead, Olalekan Sanusi, eventually escaped, narrating his ordeal and experience stated that at least 11 corpses were in the van, where he had been put in and presumed dead. Another witness Dabira Ayuku also testified that she saw seven bodies being put in a military truck at the Lekki Toll Gate.\n\nThe Nigerian army officers who carried out the massacre turned back ambulances that were invited to render first aid and assistance to wounded protesters, the report said.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the military that should be garlanded for infamy on that day. Police officers at the scene also shot at fleeing protesters. That bloody Tuesday night will remain in infamy in the annals of the Nigerian Army. But analysts say without accountability, a common thread in recorded atrocities by the Nigerian Army, and this would only be a dress rehearsal for the next massacre.\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nIn response to separatist agitations in the South East, the Nigerian security forces have committed a catalogue of human rights violations and crimes under international law including excessive use of force, physical abuse, secret detentions, and extortion, burning of houses, theft, and extrajudicial executions of suspects. Human rights groups estimated that the death toll of violence between January and June 2021 in Anambra, Imo, Abia, and Ebonyi states might run into the hundreds, reports Amnesty International.\n\n2018\n\nThe Nigerian Army has conducted operations in villages in the Northeast where they burnt down homes and opened fire on residents indiscriminately while hunting Boko Haram fighters, according to evidence gathered by Amnesty International\n\nNovember 1999\n\nIn retaliation for the killing of some policemen in Odi, Bayelsa State, by some young people clamouring for a bigger share of the oil wealth, soldiers from the Nigerian Army moved into Odi, engaged in a brief exchange of fire with the young men alleged to be responsible for the deaths of the policemen, and proceeded to raze the town. The troops demolished every single building, barring the bank, the Anglican Church and the health, and may have killed hundreds of unarmed civilians.\n\nAugust 1967\n\nThe Nigerian Army troops entered Asaba in pursuit of the retreating Biafran army, slaughtering thousands of civilians and leaving the town in ruins. They killed every male from 12 years upwards.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s pension funds are finding solace in domestic stocks with N874 billion investments as of September 30, 2021, amid declining bond yields, according to figures from the National Pension Commission (PenCom).\n\nPension Fund Administrators (PFAs), managers of the fund, in a continuous search for better returns on investment (ROI) for its retirement savings account holders with safety as priority, have during the past few months increased their stakes in stocks.\n\nFrom the unaudited report on pension funds industry portfolio for the period ended September 30, 2021, released by PenCom, N873.49 billion was invested in stocks, as against N846.55 billion in August 2021.\n\nAccording to analysts at FBNQuest, Nigerian pension funds, share of domestic equities rose slightly from 5.1 percent to 6.7 percent over the past 12 months, and members holding rose by 49 percent to N874 billion.\n\nThe all-share index (ASI) also rose by 50 percent over the same period, implying a modest shift by the PFAs into domestic equities, state the analysts.\n\nThey note that the pension industry\u2019s exposure to Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTBs) continues to trend downward. The share of NTBs fell to 63.6 percent y/y and 30.9 percent m/m to N284 billion, equivalent to 2.2 percent of the total asset under management (AUM).\n\n\u201cThe corresponding figures in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 18.0 percent, 23.6 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, which it noted was as a result of significant decline in NTBs, which made fund managers to direct their proceeds from OMO bills maturities into the NTBs space, following CBN directives baring domestic non-bank players from its OMO auctions in October 2019,\u201d the analysts note.\n\nRead Also: Pension industry sees more M&As as recapitalisation intensifies\n\nFGN bonds accounted for 60.3 percent of total AUM at the end of September, up from 57.4 percent in the year earlier period, they further note.\n\nThey however attribute this to the government\u2019s planned deficit financing in the 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cThe FGN\u2019s huge deficit financing requirement of N5.6 trillion in the 2021 budget (before the passage of the supplementary budget by the National Assembly) has contributed to pushing up yields.\n\n\u201cWe do not see this trend changing soon considering the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s FY 2022\u2019s deficit of N5.6 trillion, of which N2.51 trillion has been set as the domestic borrowing target,\u201d the FBNQuest Capital analysts say.\n\nGlory Etaduovie, managing director/CEO, IEI-Anchor Pensions, believes that renewed interest in the stock market was a reflection of the environment, given all that is playing out in the investment market.\n\nHe however notes that there was a deep-down movement in almost everything as result of COVID-19, and currently there are efforts by those who remained afloat to better their situation, and this could be reflected in increment in the stock market space.\n\nAccording to Etaduovie, after the COVID, it again became clearer that foreign direct investment was slowing since global investors focused on domestic economies. For us, we are left with no option but to rebuild our own economy, Etaduovie states.\n\nDave Uduanu, managing director/CEO, Sigma Pensions, says there is nothing fundamental in the investment figures on stocks, but a sign of recovery from COVID-19. As you are aware, a lot went down at that period, so we are coming from a low base, and not as if the economy has bounced back, he says.\n\nThere are a lot of things driving the market, including absence of foreign portfolio investors, crave for dividend, liquidity, and good results in some names, he states.\n\n\u201cI think in September, there was an open fight for control of First Bank, so stocks like Aritel rallied, MTN rallied because Airtel Africa has investment in many other countries. So, these are good names that could drive a rally.\n\n\u201cMost especially, PFAs will always invest in stocks once we get new money. What has happened was that, with the absence of foreign portfolio investment, any new money put in will lead to a rally in some good names (good stocks), and that could mean higher state,\u201d he says.",

          "title": "Shun self-centered politics to succeed in Nigeria \u2013 Elliot Uko writes Igbo leaders",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nEvangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement and secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly, has warned Igbo leaders against self-centered politics, noting that they must identify with the masses in order to earn their trust in confronting mounting challenges in the country, particularly as it affects the Igbo.\n\nUko gave the advice in an open letter to leaders on Wednesday, regretted that leadership in Igboland has degenerated over the years, to the point where the youths no longer have confidence in the leaders and want to take their destiny into their own hands.\n\nThe evangelist who went back memory lane to highlight the accomplishments of the Igbo under the able leadership of the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, noted that those who succeeded his generation failed the people by putting their individual interests above the collective interest of the people.\n\n\u201cA people\u2019s history and achievements are usually closely tied to the leadership that pilots their affairs. Aside the golden era of 1940-1965, the Igbo cannot be said to have been fortunate with unique and exemplary leadership,\u201d Uko wrote.\n\n\u201cThe great Zik dropped in from the US, via Accra, Ghana, in 1937, where he had edited the Morning Post for 24 months. He quickly made his presence felt and talent appreciated by the political community of Lagos. He then proceeded to create robust awareness and thirst for western education amongst his people, inspired community effort in academic development, especially, through scholarships, community schools and general infrastructural development through communal efforts.\n\n\u201cHe then sent the ten argonauts overseas and awaited their return, to assist him. Established chains of Newspapers and emerged leader of the NCNC, after the passing of the legendary Herbert Macaulay in 1946. He inspired a whole new generation, designed the foundation and set the stage for the greatest leap in human history. He effectively organised the people, by establishing the Igbo Union. The eboes previously only suitable for the position of messengers, houseboys and bottle washers, in the 1920s, suddenly covered the education gap with the South West, and launched ahead to produce clerks, managers, store keepers and supervisors, by 1950.\n\n\u201cHundreds of village schools built through communal efforts, transformed a people, within such a short time. Such miraculous transformation hasnt been replicated elsewhere on the planet. Leadership, inspiring leadership.\n\n\u201cCommunities taxed themselves to educate indigent but bright kids, donations were raised and very gifted chaps were sent overseas under community scholarship. Soon, a confident, solid generation of Ndigbo who could hold their own anywhere emerged. Playing prominent admirable role in education, commerce and industry, science, medicine, technology, sports and politics. The eboes earned everyone\u2019s admiration, respect and of course, envy. Those certainly were the best years of the Igbo.\u201d\n\nUko noted that the trajectory of progress and development was destroyed by the coup of January 1966, following which the Igbo fell into a political pit, and had to fight a bloody civil war.\n\nHe continued, \u201cEverything was shattered on 15th January 1966. And on the 29th of July 1966, as General Ironsi was taken out in Ibadan, Ndigbo fell into a very deep, unfriendly and dirty political pit. A pit they are yet to climb out from, even up to thisday. The attendant very bloody war, seem to have sealed their fate. And the post civil war scorched earth policy towards them, seem to have produced certain kind of leaders with certain fears and apprehension. Sadly, certain forces, factors and developments have unwittingly dug the pit deeper, making it even harder, for Ndigbo to climb out from the hostile pit of political irrelevance. To make the situation worse, many Ndigbo are unaware, and even uninterested to put heads together in search of a way out, and many unwilling to make the necessary inevitable sacrifices. Craving and desire to always place self interest over group interest, seem to have dealt a terrible blow to cohesion, unity of purpose and presence of mind and the attendant sacrifices and commitment needed to chart a way forward for the great Igbo race. Those who should lead, regrettably hate to hear that they aren\u2019t doing well. They want to be flattered and told they are the best and most able leaders in the universe. Perfect beings, saints and angels, beyond and above criticism of any sort. Hence this letter.\n\n\u201cDear Igbo leaders, the litany of mistakes, political and otherwise, that defined our journey as a people, inside Nigeria, ought to get us seriously worried and thinking about our present and future, and the great need to avoid further mistakes. Quite avoidable errors, devastated our land, wiped out our population, gave us bad press, still hinders our ascendance, and retarded our political and economic growth. When will the old woman count the contents of her basket? After how many falls? I have news for us: The younger generation are coming, and they are angry. They were born mostly outside Igboland. Ajegunle, Jos, London, Houston, Abuja, Cotonou, Douala, Oshodi, you name it. They are full blooded Igbo, both parents, Igbo, and they are not happy with Nigeria. Not happy with their leaders, not happy with the situation they found themselves. Believe it or not they are coming. They are not proud of the situation, and they are not smiling. They and their children are forced into exile by the traditional post civil war dichotomy, marginalisation, oppression, sectionalism and nepotism in the land. They want to assert their identity. They want to define and rebuild their land. They and their little children, reside and thrive in Brazil, South Africa, Canada, Ghana, Malaysia, Togo, China, Germany, France, Spain, India, the US, the UK, everywhere. Their little kids speak Mandarin, French, Espanol, Ashanti, German, you name it. They are going to shape the future of this land, build Africa\u2019s greatest economy, redefine the image of the black man and completely transform this land. They are coming and they are unstoppable. Their soul is hungry, and their heart is filled with lofty dreams of technological inventions and advancement. Their minds and spirit are filled with ambitious vision of a new world, devoid of subjugation from any quarter. They are legion. You can take this to the bank.\n\n\u201cThe millions at home, dwelling in Aba, Onitsha, Nnewi, everywhere, are bitter, but the diaspora population seem angrier.\n\n\u201cIn their 20s, 30s and 40s, Nwanne these guys don\u2019t want to be compliant all their lives to the whims of some one else. They want to be free, respected and treated right. They don\u2019t want nobody denying them any of their privileges, dues and rights henceforth. Their generation didn\u2019t loose any war, didn\u2019t suffer the humiliation of twenty pounds. Aren\u2019t ready to lick boots, betray their children or manage to live in order to please any master. Both the very educated amongst them, and the not so educated are well informed, courtesy of the social media age. And they are in a hurry to regain their lost dignity. And they are very woke. They have no intention whatsoever to see their children inherit same humiliating condition they met. Most importantly, they aren\u2019t very proud of the steps of the leaders. They have been watching and noting all.\n\n\u201cThey are aware of past mistakes of Igbo leadership. They know about the NCNC election boycott of December 1964. They aren\u2019t sure the pre war alliance with the North, was the best option available at the time. They know about the first and second coup. They aren\u2019t so sure 30th May 1967, was the best date to pull out, given the quantum of resources available and the level of preparation. They aren\u2019t sure the hardline position at two of the peace and reconciliation meetings, held in the heat of the war, were the best and wisest options available. They shudder at the number that perished in the battlefield and the frightening number who fell from malnutrition and Kwashiokor. They know of the post civil war behaviour and disposition of Igbo leaders, through the military era, till date. They know they are forced to migrate out of the zone and they also know why. No jobs, no seaport, no infrastructure, and no dignity. They reject that life.\n\n\u201cThe narrative that Igbo leaders have done excellently well since 1970, is a patently false narrative, valid only at the Sports Club, at political conclave, at elite gatherings and inside the state houses. And just for deception or entertainment purposes only. The argument that post civil war Igbo leaders have despatched their duties with utmost sincerity, dedication and concern of the welfare of the masses, remain a very high risk and dangerous opinion to express outside or in unsafe places. Our story is too clear and very obvious to the angry youngsters. They wish things were just different. They only see a bleak and frightening future. Blackmailing them, blaming them, pointing out their faults and castigating them, won\u2019t restore the confidence they lost in their leaders.\n\n\u201cOur leaders must face reality, understand the times and rise to the occasion. The me, myself and I, self-centered culture that created the doubts and distrust, must be discarded. Our leaders across board, political leaders, traditional rulers, the clergy, elders, business leaders and opinion leaders, must identify with the pains of the masses. They must seek and articulate workable solutions to the many miseries of the masses, especially, that of the aggrieved youngsters. They must be seen in front, advancing, protecting, promoting, defending and presenting the interest of the masses. There\u2019s no other way to earn the confidence and the trust of the people. Staying away from them, avoiding them, distancing from them, shunning them, gives them the impression you don\u2019t care about them. A lot of awareness have changed the template. Igbo leaders must find out what time it is. The old format of doing things have expired. They need to acquire the latest trending software. They urgently need to upgrade. They must download the latest version. Time is running out.\u201d",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen earlier in the day, Nigerian pop star, David Adeleke, popularly known by his stage name, Davido, tweeted a request to his 9.7 million followers on social media platform, Twitter, it had seemed like a regular joke.\n\n\u201cIf u know I\u2019ve given you a hit song .. send me money \u2026. una know una selves oo,\u201d he wrote in a tweet he accompanied with laughing emojies.\n\nBut as it has turned out, it\u2019s not no laughing matter. He would share his account number in a subsequent tweet, and within minutes, funds came flying in. And five hours later, his fans had sent him over N114 million, and still counting.\n\nMany, including rapper M.I Abaga, and numerous celebrities from Nigeria and beyond, sent sums ranging from N1m to over 20m each with messages of appreciation.\n\n\u201cYou people that got a hit song from David know say it\u2019s worth way more!!,\u201d M.I wrote in a tweet via @MI_Abaga, that accompanied a screenshot of N1million he gifted the singer. \u201cI want my own hit song with Davido. Fire is one of my favorite songs of all time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a demonstration of star power that has wowed many on social media, and jokes about how investing the \u201cAssurance\u201d singer could be a worthwhile investment is already a trending topic on the microblogging application.\n\n\u201cImagine investing in $DVDO?\u201d wondered Victor Asemota, a tech expert. \u201cLet me just go back to sleep. This one pass me. This is already one house in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nBut even the singer himself is surprised by the outcome of what was perhaps just a random joke, or an attempt to test people\u2019s love for him. As the funds piled up, he expressed amazement at the show of love.\n\n\u201cI know say una love me but una love me like this??\u201d he wrote. But he was in for yet more surprises. Soon the funds increased at such a rapid rate that brought him, he said, to tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually crying !! Just be good to pple man !!!! God !,\u201d he wrote subsequently. \u201cI really love you guys man !!!!\u201d\n\nYet the funds haven\u2019t stopped coming, and could yet top N150m in a few hours, all be it money earned from a random tweet jokingly soliciting for funds from fans.",

This is why, if it is about the future that young people will inherit, then, it goes without saying that more young people must be part of the conversation.\n\n\u201cMore young people like yourself should have attended COP26 to contribute to the discussions. However, I am happy that our foundation was able to support your advocacy efforts.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we need to do more on climate education. People need to understand that this is a real issue that is affecting the lives of ordinary people.\n\n\u201cThis is why, policymakers across the nation and the world need to sit down and make realistic decisions that will combat this problem here in Nigeria. A lot of the pronouncements need to be supported by policy and legislation here at home. If you remember, in the 8th Senate, we passed a Climate Change Bill that was never signed into law,\u201d Saraki, who served as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Ecology said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe need to start looking at political parties including driving manifestos to address issues of climate change,\u201d Olasupo, who is an International Development Consultant and Global Goals Youth Power Panel Member with Restless Development and Project Everyone in the United Kingdom said, \u201cYoung people need to start asking the right questions.\u201d\n\nSaraki, who alongside world leaders like Hillary Clinton and former UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, served on the Leadership Council of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves in the 7th National Assembly, has over the years campaigned for clean and efficient energy solutions to reduce Nigeria\u2019s carbon levels and create a thriving local market for clean and efficient household cooking solutions.",

          "text": "The National Youths Service Corps has called for collaborative efforts from all stakeholders in addressing the increasing rate of drug abuse and addiction among corps members.\n\nThe Ondo State Coordinator of the NYSC Mrs Victoria Ani, who expressed worry over the ugly development confirmed that the addiction among the corps members needed to be urgently addressed because the rate was alarming.\n\nAni spoke at the 2021 corps employers workshop in Akure, the state capital, on Wednesday. The workshop was themed, \u2018Optimising the NYSC/corps employers partnership for national development in the context of the New Normal.\u2019\n\nThe state coordinator, who stated that many corps members were drug addicts, called on the employers of the corps members to assist in rehabilitating them rather than rejecting them.\n\nThe stakeholders who attended the workshop had earlier complained that many corps members deployed in their establishments for places of primary assignment engaged in various acts of drug abuse and smoking of weeds(Indian hemp).\n\nReacting to the complaints, Ani said, \u201cFor the Corps members that take weeds(Indian hemp), I need to let you know that NYSC is doing so much. Many of our children (corps members) are drug addicts. I am talking out of experience. When we are in the orientation camp, we tell them that if they were into it, it was an opportunity for them to drop such habits.\n\n\u201cIn this our very last orientation, we had one that was suffering from withdrawal syndrome.

          "text": "About two years and six months after their election in 2019, 14 members of the Edo State House of Assembly on Wednesday stormed the Code of Conduct Bureau in Abuja demanding investigation of their exclusion by the Clerk of the Assembly, Audu Yahaya Omogbai.\n\nWhile demanding that they should be returned to the legislature because their constituencies have been suffering, they said the refusal of their inauguration was the height of injustice.\n\nThey called on the CCB to intervene and rescue democracy, but warned that \u201cEdo will be a dirty reference point in years to come.\u201d\n\nThe legislators who were received by the chairman of CCB, Prof. Mohammed Isah, were led by a former Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Victor Edohor and former Commissioner for Education, Washington Osifo.\n\nEdohor said, \u201cYour reputation gave birth to your engagement in CCB. Two years and six months, we have not been integrated into the House of Assembly. We, therefore, feel this is the right place to be.\u201d\n\nAccording to Osifo, the injustice unleashed on them must be corrected to avoid leaving negative history for posterity.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is in the spirit of ensuring that peoples rights are not jeopardised that we are here.\u201d\n\nOsifo also gave an insight on how, on March 17, 2019, 24 members of the House of Assembly were nominated, having won election.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn June 17 2019, ten days after the expiration of the life span of the last Assembly, governor Godwin Obaseki failed to inaugurate us with a proclamation.\u201d\n\nThe petition by the aggrieved legislators titled, \u201cComplaint of gross abuse of powers and the precipitation of crisis at the Edo State House of Assembly by Alhaji Audu Yahaya Omogbai-Clerk of the Edo State House of Assembly\u201d, was dated November 16, 2021.\n\nThe document was signed by Victor Sabor Edoror, Esan Central; Crosby Eribo, Egor; Washington Osa Osifo, Uhunmwode;\n\nChristopher Ewere Okaeben, Oredo West; Seid Oshiomhole, Etsako West 1; Michael Ohio Ezomo, Owan West and Sunday Aghedo, Ovia South West.\n\nOther signatories were Abdul Ganiyu Audu, Etsako West; Dumez Ugiagbe, Ovia North East 1; Ahmed Oshomah, Etsako Central; Eric Okaka, Owan East; Vincent Uwadiae, Ovia North East 2; Kingsley Ugabi, Etsako East and Uyiosasere Ekhosuehi, Oredo East.\n\nThe petition read in part, \u201cAlthough, the Edo State House of Assembly was purportedly \u201cinaugurated\u201d on June 17, 2019, by the Clerk of the House, Alhaji Audu Yahaya Omogbai, we were wrongfully and unconstitutionally excluded from the said \u201cinauguration\u201d, an act that has precipitated a constitutional crisis in the state where, the EDHA, contrary to the clear and unambiguous provisions of Section 91 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), is presently constituted by a minority of 10 members to the exclusion of 14 members who constitute the majority.\n\n\u201cSir, our major complaint is that the present impasse at the EDHA was caused deliberately and mischievously by Alhaji Audu Yahaya Omogbai, the current Clerk of the House. This is because he violently violated the provisions of Articles 1 and 9 of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers as contained in the 5th schedule to the constitution aforesaid.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Alhaji Audu Yahaya Omogbai, in gross abuse of his office and powers as the Clerk of the EDHA, deliberately and mischievously concealed the material information as to the date, venue and time of the inauguration of the 7th session of the EDHA from a majority of the then 15 members-elect of the House, whilst he conveyed this vital information to only seven members-elect of the EDHA, who at that material time were perceived to be loyal to the Governor of the state.\n\n\u201cThis mischievous act of Alhaji Audu Yahaya Omogbai led to the clandestine and nocturnal \u201cinauguration\u201d of the EDHA at about 9.30pm on the said June 17, 2019, with only seven out of the 24 members-elect of the House.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, Alhaji Audu Yahaya Omogbai, in further abuse of his powers and apparent display of conflict of his personal interest with that of state and national interest purportedly \u201cpresided\u201d over the election of a Speaker and a Deputy-Speaker of the EDHA, from amongst the seven minority members of the House present on that day and at his behest. Not done with this shenanigan, he assisted the \u201cSpeaker\u201d of the EDHA to selectively and pejoratively \u201cinaugurate\u201d three other members-elect of the EDHA, who in their words \u201cretraced\u201d their steps and became \u201cloyal\u2019 to the Governor of the state.\n\n\u201cSir, whilst, we need not remind you about the provisions of Sections 1 and 9 of the Code of Conduct as revealed above, it is instructive that Alhaji Yahaya also abused his office by concealing the Assets Declaration Confirmation Slips submitted by the 14 of us member-elect, preparatory to our inauguration as members of the EDHA. This was ostensible to lend credence to the already rehearsed narrative between him and his pay-masters, that the reason we (14 members-elect) were excluded from the inauguration of the House was that we were yet to fill and submit our assets declaration forms. When this was patently a white lie.\u201d\n\nThe members-elect demanded that \u201cthe clerk of the EDHA be investigated by your bureau for his gross abuse of his powers and apparent conflict of interest in the discharge of his constitutional duties as the Clerk of EDHA.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners said, \u201cWe believe that his ignoble and uncharitable actions and inactions as outlined above is the immediate cause of the present crisis at the EDHA. We believe that as a public officer who swore to obey the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), he ought to have refrained from getting involved in the murky politics orchestrated by the Governor of Edo State at the EDHA.\n\n\u201cHe failed woefully in his sacred duty to be objective, neutral and fair to all members-elect of the EDHA at its inception and infancy in 2019. This we believe ought to be investigated by your sacred institution.\u201d\n\nThe CCB chairman in his response promised that the agency would investigate the allegation and make its findings public.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CCB is an unbiased umpire. I assure you that we are going to look into your petition thoroughly and apply all that is necessary. Although you came with the press, investigations are meant to be confidential.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that we will leave no stone unturned to make sure we get all the parties. We will ensure that all sides are heard and we\u2019ll also reach out to all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe will put our reports together and do the needful. We will not go into the political aspect, but whoever needs to be dealt with will be dealt with accordingly.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

These two Igbo personalities have proven that there are capable hands in the South-East region with proven track records, to lead Nigeria. We are proud of them.\n\n\u201cThere is no better time to seek for the Igbo Presidency than now. It is not out of place or an aberration should the Igbos occupy Aso Rock come 2023 because history will vindicate us. We call on Igbo leaders to join hands and work together to ensure that this dream is actualised in 2023. This is not the time for name-calling, propaganda and backlash. This epoch calls for unity of purpose among Igbo leaders because we have a lot to gain than lose if we push to actualise Igbo Presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on all other Presidential faithful of Igbo extraction to openly declare their interest to contest like Senator Anyim and Mazi Ohuabunwa did. We encourage them to throw their hat in the ring.\n\n\u201cThe coast is now clear for the Igbos to achieve the Presidency. We are very convinced that we will get it this time around. We have just finished a closed-door meeting with Northern leaders and the outcome of the meeting is very encouraging and supportive. The Northerners, we know, as peace-loving Nigerians and other regions are sympathetic to the plights of the Igbos at this time. They will support the Igbo Presidency. Therefore, other Igbo sons and daughters should join the race.\n\n\u201cAs former President of the Senate, Chief Anyim, made the Igbos proud and has remained a detribalised Nigerian. As former Secretary to Government of the Federation, Chief Anyim brought his humility and wealth of experience to bear, to ensure the government he served succeeded. He had never betrayed anybody that worked with him. He has shown that the Igbos are detribalised Nigerians and accommodating. We commend him and encourage him, and other Igbos sons and daughters, to sustain the tempo to actualising the Igbo Presidential Project in 2023.\u201dPunch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Defence lawyers in the Wisconsin murder trial of teenager Kyle Rittenhouse said they would ask for a mistrial because of a dispute with prosecutors over video evidence.\n\nThe lawyers made their plan known as jurors ended their second day of deliberations without reaching a verdict.\n\nThis was after reviewing a series of videos of the teenager\u2019s deadly encounters at racial justice protests last year.\n\nRittenhouse, 18, is charged with killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide in the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, during a chaotic night of protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Aug. 25, 2020.\n\nThe jury of 7 women and 5 men have deliberated for roughly 14 hours over two days. Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder told them to return to court and resume discussing the case at 9 a.m. Central Time (1300 GMT) on Thursday.\n\nThe jury spent about 45 minutes on Wednesday watching drone video of the Rosenbaum shooting and other videos of the subsequent shootings of Huber and Grosskreutz.\n\nThe shootings took place in Kenosha during protests \u2013 marred by arson, rioting and looting \u2013 that followed the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed from the waist down. read more\n\nRittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, has pleaded not guilty and took the stand last week to argue that he only fired his weapon after the men attacked him. He said Rosenbaum, the first person he shot that night, grabbed the barrel of his rifle.\n\nLivestreamed, the Rittenhouse trial has emerged as the most closely watched case involving a civilian\u2019s right to self-defense since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in 2013.\n\nLike Zimmerman, Rittenhouse has become a polarizing figure, viewed as heroic by some conservatives who favour expansive gun rights and as a symbol of a reckless American gun culture by many on the left.\n\nKenosha has been on edge during the trial, and a small crowd of demonstrators assembled on the courthouse steps again on Wednesday, some holding signs in support of Rittenhouse and others calling for his conviction.",

          "text": "\n\nChief of Air Staff Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao has assured Nigerians that the end of insurgency and banditry is in sight.\n\nAlso, the Senate, through its committee on Air Force, tasked the nation\u2019s military to intensify its onslaughts against insurgents and bandits for the required peace and development in the affected areas.\n\nThe positions came three days after a senior army officer, Brigadier-General Dzarma Zirkusu and four soldiers were killed by the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Askira Uba, Borno state.\n\nAmao assures\n\nGiving the assurance Tuesday during the 2022 budget defence session before the lawmakers, Air Marshal Amao said insurgents of whatever faction, be it Boko Haram or ISWAP, \u201chave been devastatingly decimated and degraded with attendant loss of fighters and weapons, forcing several of them to surrender voluntarily on weekly basis.\n\n\u201cRequired onslaughts tactically and strategically are already mapped out to route out remnants of the insurgents attacking villages and military outposts in pretence of still being potent.\n\n\u201cIn line with the core mandate of the Air Force and military generally, the territorial integrity of Nigeria is being protected from against the insurgents and bandits who, in no distant time, will be completely be wiped out.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force chief further said as the 2021 budgetary allocations given to the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) was judiciously used in prosecuting the war against the insurgents and bandits as well as improving the welfare of officers and men, the 2022 allocations would also be expended judiciously for similar purposes.\n\n\u201cIn the face of challenges at hand, prudency and accountability have been the guiding principle of implementation of budgetary allocations by the Nigeria Air Force,\u201d Amao said.\n\nIn his remarks before the session went into closed door, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Air Force, Senator Ibn Bala Na\u2019 Allah (APC Kebbi South), tasked the military outfit to use all resources within its disposal in routing out the remnants of the insurgents in particular and make the forests inhabitable for bandits , kidnappers and all forms of criminals .\n\n\u201cThe Air Force and by extension the military generally, deserve commendation from Nigerians as far as war against insurgency and banditry are concerned. But Nigerians want these enemies of the nation to be completely defeated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cFor us on this committee and in the National Assembly, required appropriations in terms of procurement of weapons, armaments and enhancement of welfare of officers and men in the military, shall be made since essence of governance itself is security and welfare of citizenry,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nNULGE\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has demanded the immediate release of 12 of her members in Zaria local government council, Kaduna state, kidnapped since November 8, 2021.\n\nNULGE National President Comrade Akeem Ambali Olatunji made the demand Tuesday in an interview with journalists in Abuja.\n\nHe frowned at the \u2018silence\u2019 of the Kaduna state government since their abduction, warning that the union might be forced to take a drastic action nationwide if her plea for the workers\u2019 release fell on deaf ears.\n\nHe said nine out of the 12 workers were nursing mothers and married women, stressing that urgent action must be taken to secure the their release without delay.\n\nOlatunji further disclosed that the kidnappers had contacted the families of the victims and were demanding N40million ransom.\n\nOn the ill-fated day, the NULGE leader said of the 13 local government workers, one of them-a driver-was released to report the incident to the victims\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cThese workers have been in captivity of kidnappers since 8 of November, 2021 thereby causing untold hardship in the mind of the family and the union leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are disturbed because Kaduna state government kept mute till now as if all is well, when it has become dangerous for workers to go to work within official working hours or move about within the local government or the state. This calls for great concern.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons NULGE has been canvassing for total freedom of local government. Our belief is that if local government is made functional and is directly funded, LGAs have what it takes to tame the tide of insecurity along the rural areas. Our belief is that all security challenges are local. This has further amplified our clamour for actualisation of local autonomy.\n\n\u201cIn a state that people are been kidnapped here and there, the state government appears to be helpless and this calls for concern. We are therefore making a serious appeal to the government of Kaduna state to make it a matter of urgency and importance the need to work assiduously towards the release of our members in good health.\n\n\u201cWorkers must have the freedom to work, to move about within their locality. So we are therefore sounding this as our first plea, if this is not done, the union would not wait and watch our helpless members being harassed, kidnapped, raped and killed,\u201d Olatunji said.\n\nThe union leader further said: \u201cThe kidnappers have contacted the families of their victims and are demanding for N40million ransom for the remaining 12 persons. 13 of them were kidnapped in a local government official vehicle and one of them was freed, the driver to go and tell the families.\n\n\u201cYou see, the scenario was made worse because of the shutdown of telecommunications in Kaduna state. It has further affected easy communication between the people and even ability to give warning signals to members of our staff and even the people of the state.\n\n\u201cThey said they have to shutdown network communication in Kaduna and so many other areas to improve security, but what we are witnessing now is becoming worst. So for us, NULGE cannot raise N40million, the family members are so poor, they cannot raise money, these are poor workers whose N30, 000 minimum wage is not fully paid. I don\u2019t know how they intend to secure their release.\n\n\u201cAnd to make the matter worse, government is saying they cannot pay ransom. If they are not paying, they should be proactive and secure the release of these people, we can\u2019t allow them to be killed. Something urgently needs to be done, enough of this situation in Zaria local government.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to use his good office since Kaduna state government appears to be overwhelmed by insecurity, to come in quickly to ensure that our local government workers will be fully secured from the den of kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIf the situation remains the same in the days ahead, the national leadership would have to take a proactive action to send a signal to both state and the federal governments that our members are very important, because the first duty of any government is to secure life and property.\u201d",

          "text": "A swathe of alleged fake appointment and recruitment letters in possession of many employment seekers has compelled the setting up of service-wide verification exercise for all officers recruited by the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) from 2013 to 2020.\n\nThis follows accusation and counter accusations from the commission and some Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that expressed serious reservations over the commission\u2019s persistent seizure of recruitment and appointment letters they forwarded to the FCSC for authentication and subsequent documentation and enrolment for the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) capturing.\n\nFCSC\n\nThese letters, which bear insignia and stamp of the FCSC, as well as the signature of the director recruitment and appointment who does that on behalf of the chairman of the commission, are accepted and honoured by the MDAs.\n\nBut the FCSC frowned at those letters on the grounds that they did not emanate from them.\n\nBlueprint Newspapers investigation spanning over three months, reveals that on an average, no fewer than two dozens of such fake appointments and recruitment letters in the possession of desperate job seekers were weekly seized by the commission.\n\nFor instance, our investigation revealed that no fewer than 300 of such alleged fake appointment and recruitment letters from one of the core ministries located at Mabuchi were seized by the commission within two months in 2019, and subsequently, a further 20 from the same ministry during the peak month of the COVID 19 saga last year.\n\nThe authenticity of such letters, we learnt, is usually questioned by the commission when request for their confirmation is sought by the respective registries of the MDAs for subsequent documentation of the \u2018newly\u2019 appointed and \u2018recruited\u2019 staff and enrolment for the IPPIS capturing of staffers to enable them draw statutory benefits as bonafide civil servants in the federal civil service.\n\nObscure ministries worst hit\n\nMost of the fake appointment and recruitment letters, sources observed, are largely from the MDAs, especially \u201cvery obscure agencies which are largely a drainpipe of public funds as they are hardly noticeable and of any significant socio-economic cum political value\u201d, according to a top Federal Character Commission (FCC) source.\n\nSome of the fake letters obtained by our reporter showed that all cadres of staff allegedly recruited and appointed by the FCSC, were sent directly to the respective ministries as against the statutory practice of recruited technical officers being sent to their designated ministries by the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.\n\nIn two of many instances, computer analysts and other middle level technical officers were sent directly from the FCSC to the then Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing in 2017 and in 2019, a development that aroused suspicion from some staff members in the registry department of one of the now dual ministries.\n\nAccording to a dependable source, one of the staff member who raised an alarm got permission from his superiors to seek the commission\u2019s confirmation of the authenticity of the letters.\n\nTheir fears were confirmed as those letters were found to be fake and thereafter seized even as the bearers disappeared into the thin air.\n\nFCSC reacts, initiates verification exercise\n\nA key player in the recruitment and appointment department of the FCSC who wished not to be mentioned said \u201cthe commission is fully aware of the prevalence of fake recruitment and appointment letters being paraded about by employment seekers. We are particularly concerned because cases of such fake letters are increasingly embarrassing to the commission. To say the least, it\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned that it is rampant and the culprits are mostly from the MDAs. In fact, on an average, we have seized between two and above dozens of such letters weekly and we are working hard to prosecute those found with such incriminating letters\u201d, the source said looking pensive.\n\nSimilarly, the Director of Recruitment and Appointment in the commission, Mr Ibrahim el-Yakubu, said the frequency of occurrence of such letters necessitated the FCSC to carry out a service-wide verification exercise for all officers recruited by it from 2013 to 2020.\n\nHe said the essence is to curb cases of immorality in recruitment.\n\nThe circular FC3171/S.7/T3/101 issued on the 27th of August, 2021, directed all MDAs to carry out the exercise.\n\nThough the verification exercise, which began on the 4th of October ought to have been rounded off on the 9th of October, the director said it is ongoing and therefore could not confirm the outcome of the exercise and what percentage of verified staff were found wanting.\n\nBlueprint can confirm that the exercise has been conducted at the ministries of commerce, industries, information and orientation, education, trade and investment, water resources, OSGF, justice, agriculture, women affairs, science and tech, youth and sports and foreign affairs and interior, among others.\n\nEmployment seekers pay between N.8m to N1.5m\n\nFurther investigation also revealed that desperate employment seekers are compelled to pay between N800, 000 and N1.5million to officials of the commission and some directors in the MDAs.\n\nAccording to a source who declined being mentioned by name, some directors in the MDAs would declare vacancies by way of replacements and connived with certain elements in the FCSC to recruit whoever has the means to buy the job.\n\nAccording to him, at the commission, an officer may demand for payment of N400,000 or more to get the recruitment and appointment letter issued, while the director or whoever may be in charge of wherever the vacancy is declared, demands N500,000 and above, depending on the \u2018liquidity\u2019 of the agency or ministry.\n\n\u201cFor instance, some months ago, an employment seeker coughed out N1m which he sourced from relatives to \u2018buy\u2019 an employment in one teaching institution in one of the states in the North Central region,\u201d the source said.\n\nOHSF queries ministries, ICPC steps in\n\nFollowing petitions by some concerned staffers of various ministries, the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation, we learnt, has on several occasions queried some of the MDAs as was the case when sometimes last year it asked the Ministry of Works to respond to one of the petitions raised by concerned staff member over alleged practice of documenting new recruits with fake letters of appointment, including those whose letters were supposedly seized by the FCSC.\n\nWe could not confirm whether the ministry and indeed others queried by the OHSF have acted in line with the request.\n\nAnti-graft agencies step in\n\nHowever, we can confirm that the anti-graft agencies have stepped into some of the cases.\n\nIt was gathered that the anti-graft bodies have received petitions from either the victims of the employment racket or junior staff being singled out by suspected \u2018rogue\u2019 senior officers who may have connived with other elements at the FCSC, for undeserved punishment by way of transfer out of the ministry and denial of due benefits.\n\nAlready, the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related offences Commission (ICPC) acknowledged receiving a number of petitions, including one against the works ministry for such misdemeanour.",

Inasmuch as we know these are things we have been doing, we have not done enough and we need to do more.\n\n\u201cThe money we use in fighting insurgency, and buying bullets, and airplanes, if we spend half, we can stem poverty, unemployment and violence from the roots.\u201d\n\nThe minister added, \u201cIn Nigeria with our population, we have 90 per cent of the young population. For me, that is the greatest danger; it has already started showing symptoms and signs.\n\n\u201cThere is violence, insecurity, banditry ravaging all of Africa; Nigeria now is getting its turn of the madness.

Sometimes, they pose a menace, especially if they don\u2019t have skills, but those who have skills, we need to regularise them and make them legal migrants and residents in your country.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nigeria will benefit from patient-centered pharmacy practice model\u2019\n\nThe Consul General of Germany in Lagos, Dr Bernid van Munchow-Pohl, on his part, said, \u201cYouth unemployment is high.

          "title": "Canada: Deadly Storm Cuts Transport Links Around Vancouver",
          "text": "A deadly storm described by officials as a once-in-a-century weather event has severed road and rail links around Vancouver, Canada.\n\nTwo motorways connecting the West Coast city were closed after being damaged by severe flooding.\n\nA woman was killed in a highway landslide, and rescuers say at least two other people are missing.\n\nThousands of people were forced to leave their homes due to the massive storm, which struck on Monday.\n\nThe woman\u2019s body was found near Lillooet, about 250km (155 miles) from Vancouver, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nRCMP Sgt Janelle Shoihet said that rescuers had not yet determined the number of \u201coccupied vehicles that were lost in the slide\u201d, according to AFP news agency.\n\nMotorist Kathie Rennie told CBC News she saw the landslide come down on traffic that was already at a standstill south of Lillooet.\n\n\u201cNo sooner do we get back into our vehicles, the people that were in front of us are just screaming and running,\u201d she said. \u201cThe look on their faces, it was like a tsunami was coming. It was the scariest thing that I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\u201cI just turned around, and I\u2019m just watching the whole side of the mountain coming down and taking out these cars\u2026 everything just being swept away. Just complete panic.\u201d\n\nThe provincial minister of transportation, Rob Fleming, told a news conference it was the \u201cworst weather storm in a century\u201d.\n\nThousands of homes in British Columbia were evacuated after an \u201catmospheric river\u201d dumped the region\u2019s monthly rainfall average in just 24 hours.\n\nAll 7,000 residents of Merritt, about 120 miles north-east of Vancouver, were ordered to flee their homes on Monday.\n\nSnow fell on there on Tuesday, and cars could be seen floating in icy flood waters in town.\n\nHelicopter crews were also sent to the mountain town of Agassiz to rescue about 300 people who became trapped on a cut-off road.\n\nMonday\u2019s rains and winds had largely finished by Tuesday afternoon, but several communities remained stranded.\n\nPart of the Trans-Canada Highway, which connects Vancouver to the rest of the country, was submerged under water.\n\nA chunk of the Coquihalla Highway, which links Vancouver to the province interior, appeared to have crumbled into floodwaters.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa he was monitoring the situation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there to help in any way, shape or form,\u201d Mr Trudeau said.\n\nAt one point the main available land route out of Vancouver was to enter the US and then return to Canada. However, re-entering Canada from the US requires a negative coronavirus test, and roads in the border state of Washington were also affected by the storm.\n\nThe port of Vancouver, the largest in Canada, was forced to suspend all rail access because of the flooding and landslides, halting shipments of food, fuel and other goods.\n\nThe port moves about C$550m ($440m) worth of cargo every day, according to Reuters news agency. Fuel pipelines in the area have also been turned off as a precaution.\n\nIt comes after British Columbia suffered a record high heat wave over the summer that killed more than 500 people, and wildfires that destroyed an entire town.\n\nEarlier this month, a tornado was spotted in British Columbia \u2013 the first time one has been seen in the area in five decades.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Senate and the House of Representatives on Tuesday resolved to intervene in the diplomatic row between Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) following disagreements between both countries.\n\nAt the Senate, the decision to wade into the dispute was reached sequel to a point of order by the Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, during plenary.\n\nAbaribe, while relying on Orders 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules recalled that in December 2020, a memorandum of understanding was executed between Nigeria and the UAE to provide a platform for both countries to engage each other bilaterally.\n\nGiving insight into the circumstances surrounding the disagreement between both countries, the lawmaker noted that in February 2021, the federal government of Nigeria stopped the UAE national carrier, emirates airline from subjecting Nigerian travellers to additional rapid antigen test as against its stipulated negative PCR test at the Lagos and Abuja airports before departure.\n\nAccording to Abaribe, Emirates airline then shut down flights to and from Nigeria owing to the disagreement between the airline and the aviation authorities on the propriety of subjecting passengers travelling from Nigeria to emergency COVID-19 protocols.\n\nHe, however, said after an interface between the authorities of the aviation ministry and Emirates airline, flights resumed but the Emirates airline continued to conduct test for passengers before departure from Nigeria, a development the federal government frowned at and thus suspended the airline from flying to and from Nigeria.\n\nAbaribe further expressed concern that, \u201cthere are allegations that hundreds of legal resident Nigeria living in UAE are losing their jobs on account of the refusal of the authorities to renew their work permit which offends the letters of bilateral agreements which both nations are signatory to.\n\n\u201cWorried that there are speculations that the refusal by the UAE authorities to renew work permit for Nigerians living in there is a calculated attempt to pressure the Nigerian government into accepting their conditions of service for their national airline that may have lost humongous revenue from the Nigeria route.\n\n\u201cFurther worried that if the Nigerian government does not urgently engage the authorities of the UAE , thousands of Nigerians living and working will lose their jobs and means of livelihood hence the need for a quick interface with the authorities of the UAE.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the upper chamber in a resolution mandated the Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs, Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Covid-19 and national security and intelligence and Interior (Immigration Service), respectively, to interface with the ministry of Foreign Affairs, and National Intelligence Agency (NIA) on best ways of resolving this crisis and report back to the Senate within two weeks.\n\nOn the other hand, at the House of Representatives, the lawmakers\u2019 decision to wade into the dispute was sequel to the adoption of an urgent motion sponsored by the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu at the plenary.\n\nElumelu had while moving the motion, noted that Nigeria and the UAE have had a positive diplomatic relationship and in 2009 the UAE established its embassy in Nigeria.\n\nHe also recalled that in December 2020 a memorandum of understanding was executed between Nigeria and the UAE to provide a platform for both countries to engage each other bilaterally and narrated the cause of the dispute between both countries.\n\nHe also expressed concern that hundreds of legal resident Nigerians living in UAE were losing their jobs on account of the refusal of the authorities to renew their work permit which he also pointed out offends the letters of bilateral agreements which both nations are signatory to.\n\nAdopting the motion, the House also resolved to set up an adhoc committee from the following house committees on Aviation, Foreign Affairs, PTF on Covid-19, national security and intelligence and Interior (Immigration Service), National Orientation Agency, Diaspora and Treaties respectively to interface with the ministry of Foreign Affairs, Aviation and National Intelligence Agency (NIA), PTF on Covid-19, immigration Service, Diaspora commission and National Orientation Agency on best ways of resolving this crisis.\n\nThe adhoc committees were given four weeks to carry out the exercise and report back to the house.\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja",
