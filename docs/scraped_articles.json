          "title": "Police in show of force as agitator insists on Lagos rally today",
          "text": "Barring any last-minute change, agitators of the Yoruba nation and men of the Lagos State Police Command may be at loggerheads as the demonstrators embark on a mega rally in the state today against police order.\n\nThe agitators had insisted on holding the rally despite police warnings to shelve the plan.\n\nThe rally was organised by Chief Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho and the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, led by a renowned historian and former senator, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye.\n\nIgboho had initially suspended the rally after operatives of the DSS laid siege to his residence in the Soka area of Ibadan around 1 am on Thursday, killing two persons and arresting 13 others.\n\nThe Yoruba Council of Elders and Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, had slammed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for the attack on Igboho\u2019s home, urging the Federal Government to investigate the attack and bring those behind it to justice.\n\nOn Thursday, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, warned organisers of the planned Yoruba Nation rally and their followers to stay off the streets of Lagos, adding that anyone caught would be dealt with according to the law.\n\nOdumosu said intelligence reports available to the police indicated that some people had perfected plans to infiltrate the protesters and cause mayhem in the state.\n\nThe CP reiterated the warning in a statement on Friday by the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, just as a number of policemen embarked on a show of force across the state to deter the agitators.\n\nThe armed policemen moved round some parts of the state on Friday in armoured vehicles and patrol vans.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe command and the government of Lagos State had warned the organisers of the planned Oodua Republic Mega Rally, scheduled for Saturday, 3rd July, 2021, at Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park, Ojota, to steer clear of Lagos State, considering the available intelligence reports on the planned rally and to forestall any breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cThe command and other security agencies, including the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Federal Road Safety Corps and Department of State Services have, however, put measures in place to prevent any act of lawlessness, oppression and intimidation of any kind in the state on the said date, 3rd July, 2021, and beyond as Lagos State cannot afford to record and experience the violence orchestrated by some individuals during the 2020 #EndSARS protest that led to massive destruction of lives and properties in the state.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Ilana Omo Oodua insisted on Friday that the rally would hold as scheduled.\n\nThe group\u2019s General Secretary, George Akinola, said it was the responsibility of the police to protect protesters and all law-abiding people, saying the group had held the same rally in other states in the South-West without being hijacked by hoodlums.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have read what the police said and they did not even say our planned rally is illegal. They talked about hoodlums and also talked traffic jam.\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of the police to ensure that hoodlums do not infiltrate us. We have held our rally in other states and none of it was hijacked. The police in Lagos State should also not allow this one to be hijacked. We will cooperate with the police.\n\n\u201cPoliticians, religious organisations and others hold rallies and processions in Lagos and they were not stopped because of traffic jam. We are not going to disturb other people, so we will cooperate with the police. We are calling on the police to protect us on Saturday. It will hold on Saturday but the venue will be communicated later.\u201d\n\nPolicemen stationed on rally ground\n\nOne of our correspondents, who visited Ojota on Friday evening, saw about 18 policemen around the Gani Fawehinmi Park and M.K.O. Abiola Gardens.\n\nNine fully-armed policemen were seen stationed around the park with an unmarked Sienna car with the inscription \u2018Police Ogudu Division,\u2019 a Mitsubishi bus with the inscription \u2018Anti-crime Area Hotel\u2019 and two motorbikes boldly bearing \u2018police\u2019.\n\nAn open van fully-loaded with policemen, numbering over 13 was also seen patrolling the area. Some of the policemen were conducting a stop-and-search on cars as they questioned a few passersby.\n\nWhen asked if the police presence in the area was a regular occurrence, an attendant at a filling station, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, \u201cNormally, policemen used to be stationed around Abiola Gardens where they arrest suspected Yahoo boys (Internet fraudsters), but I am surprised why they are on patrol. They have been doing so since I resumed duty.\u201d\n\nAlso, in a live Facebook broadcast monitored by Saturday PUNCH on Friday, Igboho\u2019s spokesperson, Olayomi Koiki, maintained that the rally would hold as planned, adding that Igboho would be back stronger.\n\nHe said, \u201cI can still confirm officially that the Lagos rally, irrespective of whatever news or rumours you\u2019ve been listening to from different outlets, will go as planned. The 3rd of July mega rally will go on as planned. All arrangements for the rally have been planned and nothing has changed.\n\n\u201cI have spoken to the organisers, nothing has changed so far. On the 3rd of July from exactly 9 am [the rally will start]. The whole arrangement and planning are going on. I\u2019ve spoken with the General Secretary of Ilana Omo Odua, George Akinola and Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye and he (Akintoye) is working tirelessly for the release of those taken away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rally in Lagos is going to be a peaceful rally, it is going to be a mega rally; do not be disturbed about what happened. So many developments took place at Igboho\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nHe said Igboho urged the people not to be weighed down about the attack in his house, noting that \u201che is standing with the Yoruba Nation agenda.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Agbonkhese Oboh\n\nChief Ayo Adebanjo\n\nThe Leader of Yoruba apex group, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has said the way the Federal Government was handling the Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho saga was reminiscing of the dictatorial Abacha military regime.\n\nChief Adebanjo said this in a BBC Pidgin interview on Friday, where he pointed out that the government flouted due process in a supposed constitutional democracy.\n\nThe Afenifere leader said: \u201cWe are now back to the Abacha days, when they decided to kill all of us.\n\n\u201cThey bombed the house of Akirinade, they attempted to kill Pa Adesanya. Many others escaped by a hair\u2019s breadth.\n\n\u201cI have been saying it before, that this President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration agenda to Fulanise this country.\n\n\u201cThey said they have information that Igboho has arms in his house. Fair enough; go there with an arrest warrant or search warrant and do your job.\n\n\u201cEven if there was forced entry, then you should break the house? That\u2019s to tell you the evil intention to kill everybody there. Is that the job of a democratic government?\n\n\u201cIf you have a criminal, you arrest and prosecute him; allow the law to take its course.\n\n\u201cIn December 2018, they killed 800 Christian on Christmas eve in Kaduna. It is on record. He sent the Vice President there to stop the uprising. He did not send the Army and DSS after the culprits.\n\nAdebanjo added that \u201cThey went to Agatu, Benue. Ortom said he knew the perpetrators. They wrote him a letter that they were coming back. He went to Buhari to report. He did not send in the Army.\n\n\u201cNow the whole of the elected southern governors, across party lines, came to the conclusion that the insecurity in the region is caused by killer-herdsmen. He ignored them.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency decides to exhume a law that does not exist. It is obvious that the President is not interested in peace, but pursuing a Fulani agenda. And it\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nTold that the secret service agents said Igboho has arms in his house, hence the raid, Adebanjo said roared: \u201cMy dear, it is arrant nonsense! Arrant nonsense! Is that the way to go in a constitutional democracy? To invade someone\u2019s house at midnight?\n\n\u201cThat was how they went after judges at night, claiming they are looking for corrupt judges. No one says they shouldn\u2019t arrest. But there is a constitutional procedure.\n\n\u201cHas the President done the same thing with the known people wreaking havoc across the country?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with violence. But is there freedom of movement and association anymore? So this is ethnic cleansing.\n\n\u201cIgboho has arms? But are they looking at the action that caused that reaction? People are attacking him.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Festus Ahon, ASABA\n\nAGAINST recent media report, members of the All Progressives Congress, APC of Urhobo extraction, Friday, said Delta South Senatorial District is made up of four indigenous tribes of Ijaw, Urhobos, Isokos and Itsekiris.\n\nMr. Benjamin Eboh and Gabriel Okandeji in a statement on behalf of Urhobo APC members who are indigenes of Okere Urhobo and Agbarha Warri Kingdoms comprising six INEC Electoral Wards in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta South Senatorial District, insisted that the urhobos have two Kingdoms of Agbarha Warri and Okere Urhobo in Warri South Local Government Area.\n\nThe Urhobos who were reacting to media reports which tend to portray that Delta South Senatorial District is made up of only the Ijaws, Itsekiris and Isokos, said it was insulting for anybody in the APC or elsewhere to state otherwise.\n\nThe people in the statement, said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to very inaccurate and provocative statements from certain elements in Delta APC who have been posturing that Delta South Senatorial District is made up of only three tribes namely Ijaw, Isoko and Itsekiri.\n\n\u201cNothing can be further from the truth than this. This is criminal falsehood which is highly reprehensible. Delta South Senatorial District is made up of four indigenous tribes namely Ijaw, Isoko, Itsekiri and Urhobo. It is insulting and indeed criminal for anybody in our party APC or elsewhere to state otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe Urhobos of Delta South Senatorial District occupy two legally recognized indigenous and independent kingdoms in Warri South. These are the Okere Urhobo Kingdom of Warri South Local Government Area with their traditional ruler, the Orosuen of Okere Urhobo Kingdom and Agbarha Warri Kingdom of Warri South Local Government Area with their traditional ruler, the Ovie of Agbarha Warri.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the two urhobo Kingdoms in Warri have six Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC delineated wards in Warri South Local Government Area out of the total 12 INEC wards in Warri South Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cThe indigenous Urhobos in the Okere Urhobo and Agbarha Warri Kingdoms with six INEC Wards in Warri South Local Government Area have the same rights, and privileges accruable to the Ijaw, Isoko and Itsekiri indigenes in the Delta South Senatorial District.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, misleading, mischievous and provocative for any person to try to convey the impression that there are only three ethnic groups in Delta South Senatorial District.\n\n\u201cWe have also noticed statements by certain persons in the APC who are trying to equate what they call 3i\u2019s association (made up of Ijaw, Isoko and Itsekiri) as equal and representative of the entire Delta South Senatorial District. This is outright falsehood and cannot be tolerated in a decent society.\n\n\u201cThis posturing by these persons is misleading, mischievious and provocative with the sole aim of creating a false impression that there are only three indigenous tribes in Delta South Senatorial District.\n\n\u201cAs stated above, Delta South Senatorial District is made up of four indigenous tribes \u2013 Ijaw, Isoko, Itsekiri and Urhobo with equal political and economic rights, as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.\n\n\u201cWe will not tolerate a situation where persons in our party continue to make statements and engage in activities towards giving a false impression that Delta Senatorial District is made up of only three indigenous tribes of Ijaw, Isoko and Itsekiri tribes only. This is highly provocative and will not be tolerated\u201d.",

          "title": "Intra-party democracy as panacea to gender equity",
          "text": "By Nnedinso Ogaziechi\n\nThe political philosophers who fashioned out the democratic system seem to have understood human nature very well. They know that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and they created the three arms of government, the executive, judiciary and the legislature.\n\nOf the three arms, the legislature somewhat stands on a pedestal due to the unique functions that it is saddled with in a democracy; law-making, oversight functions and being representatives of the people. It is for this reason that the military that often interrupts democratic governments first suspends the legislative arm and replace them with the military ruling councils of any nomenclature they want. The executive and judiciary seem not to have suffered the same setbacks.\n\nIn Nigerian democratic experiences, the executive often appears to be too powerful and the legislative arm often suffer too much loses in terms of getting the democratic processes to function without interferences. The executive at both federal and state levels seem to monopolize power in ways that often derail democracy. In Nigeria, the President and governors seem too powerful and this is why most lovers of democracy are clamoring for the devolution of power and restructuring of the country.\n\nDemocracy is a game of numbers and that means that the gender representation in all tiers of government must have a level of balance for democracy to flourish. This is one of the fundamental problems of Nigerian democracy. There is a monopoly of power by the men at all levels. At all levels we see the crass abuse of power by the executive either at party levels or after inauguration. We have seen the tokenism that has been women participation in Nigerian politics. The legislative arm is where laws are made do not have enough women due to executive interferences at state levels as they often insist on determining who gets what.\n\nThere have been dire consequences as Nigeria ranks globally, continentally and sub-regionally lowest in women representation in parliament.\n\nThe RoundTable Conversation has been researching into this very huge problem as a way of discussing the Nigerian political problem \u2013 the lack of a balanced inclusiveness of women in politics. We spoke to Hon. Kate Raymond Mamuno, a retired civil servant and the only female in the Adamawa House of Assembly who also chairs the House Committee on Finance, Appropriation and Budget and the Committee on Women Affairs.\n\nIn her years in the civil service, she had observed the problems of women and development in her constituency and the fact that some cultural and religious nuances empowered men to exclude women in leadership at all levels. Having done her bit in the civil service she believed that venturing into politics could give women a louder voice. She had the first female senator from the North East, Senator Grace Bent as a mentor who she learnt a lot and got huge encouragement and support from.\n\nTo Mamuno, times have changed from the parochial ideas of the past that implied that women are only good for domestic duties and child bearing. To her women must be ready to go out there and fight to access power as men would not offer that on any platter. It is left for women to collaborate with men in ways that can be mutually beneficial because men and women can only complement and not compete with each other for development to happen.\n\nShe believes that politicians in Nigeria must learn to work together and women especially must team up to achieve better political visibility and relevance. Women must begin to work as a team and that is why she believes that the formation of the Adamawa Women in Politics both at home and in Abuja can help galvanize efforts for an increased presence of women in politics. Women are in a better position to understand and work on issues that affect women and the youths. This is because when you empower a woman, you empower a nation because they invariably reinvests in their homes and children.\n\nTo her, having a voice for women in the legislature is priceless because all the gender based violence and prejudices must be talked about by those wearing the shoe and who know where it pinches. Women in the country must be politically alert because even working with men who understand the issues cannot be overemphasized. She acknowledges that some men actually support women in the field. The governor of her state, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri has been supportive in approving the financial resources needed to facilitate the projects that can help the female population and youths.\n\nHon. Kate believes women must know their rights. Nobody should take women for granted but help them to know and demand their rights so that things like violence of any type, child marriages and illiteracy can be eradicated and there would be development. It is a pride to be a woman and every woman should be validated to realize that they have potentials. Many good men are always ready to support women but women must first know their rights. We must all ensure that more women come up and are equipped for nation-building through enlightenment and advocacy. We as women must take responsibility for the development of our nation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPrincess Adekemi Adewunmi is an educationist, entrepreneur and experienced politician who has been in the field since 1998. She has seen and experienced the good, the bad and ugly of Nigerian politics and is in a good stead to analyze the issues and proffer what in her evaluation are ways to solve the lack of gender parity in Nigerian politics. Having contested to represent her Ekiti constituency at the Federal House of Representatives in 2019 after many previous attempts were seemingly sabotaged, she believes that the dysfunctional system in the Nigerian political field that has stalled development in the nation is not a natural disaster that is beyond Nigerians to solve.\n\nShe believes that many politicians in Nigeria do not have the interest of the people at heart and when a public officer does not understand that leadership is about helping the people to have a better life, the whole system suffers. As someone who got startled by her research findings about the Nigeria political system even before independence as part of her Master\u2019s degree thesis, she believes that we must all as Nigerians make a conscious decision to create a better country for our children and impact positively on the people..\n\nShe believes that at the core of our political problem across the country is the pursuit of power for its own sake by most politicians. There is a big disconnect between the intensions of most politicians and the rhetoric they mouth at campaigns and internal party operations. To Princess Adenike, the people and their welfare must be the guiding principle of anyone seeking political power. The fact that Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world given how blessed with both material resources and human capital is an eloquent testimony that many political players are not there to give service to the people.\n\nAs one who has gone through the political crucible, there is a preponderance of politicians with zero altruistic intent. Her research was an eye opener to her and she felt she can only contribute by being a participant but as a woman, the Nigerian political environment needs a lot of reorientation and re-evaluation for us to make progress. She believes that there must be internal party democracy that provides a level playing field to everyone who wants to contest and the beauty of democracy is the fairness of allowing the people to choose their leadership.\n\nShe believes that people at the grassroots know genuine individuals whose pedigree guides their actions and so even if charlatans decide to influence them or induce them with material gifts, they would always choose those they have faith in to serve them diligently and honestly. Gender has nothing to do with service deliver and she is sad that most male politicians display a nauseous entitlement mentality even when they have nothing to offer the people repeatedly across different electoral periods.\n\nShe believes that women hold the key to how they should be treated by the men in politics but everyone must show a sense of patriotism to the nation by making sure that all the shenanigans that all political parties tolerate from most male politicians must be checked if we must move out of the poverty capital of the world position. Leadership is a serious business and is not about gender. Women leaders are making waves around the globe in admirable ways so why not Nigeria? We must all begin to dismantle all the divisive factors like ethnicity, religion and gender.\n\nTo her, many older female politicians have set good examples in the ways they have fought for gender parity in the Nigerian political space. Women like Iyom Josephine Anenih, Hajia Maina and Grace Bent are some of the mentors she believes have worked so hard for women\u2019s voices to be heard. They are the ones she says she is learning resilience and courage from and she feels Nigerian women need more of such women for an impactful participation in politics.\n\nAdenike believes that greed by some men she describes as \u2018political businessmen\u2019 in politics is ruining the country because they are just in politics for the political expediencies. Until the national and party constitutions and not abuse of power by the men begin to guide political party primaries to choose party candidates, our democracy cannot grow and our children would inherit a shambolic country if we continue this way.\n\nWomen must take their spaces in the political field and refuse to be intimidated because democracy is about the people and their choices. People that have consistently played selfish politics must be flushed out with rule of law and pursuit of equity and fairness. Women must refuse to be blackmailed and frustrated out by incompetent men. There are female politicians too that display the Stockholm Syndrome but time will weed them out. . They often lack the zeal to mentor other women and easily forget that power is very ephemeral. They never think of legacies to leave.\n\nThe dialogue continues\u2026",
          "summary": "Democracy is a game of numbers and that means that the gender representation in all tiers of government must have a level of balance for democracy to flourish.\nThis is one of the fundamental problems of Nigerian democracy.\nShe has seen and experienced the good, the bad and ugly of Nigerian politics and is in a good stead to analyze the issues and proffer what in her evaluation are ways to solve the lack of gender parity in Nigerian politics.\nTo Princess Adenike, the people and their welfare must be the guiding principle of anyone seeking political power.\nTo her, many older female politicians have set good examples in the ways they have fought for gender parity in the Nigerian political space.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nFourteen years after the first attempt was made, the Senate and House of Representatives, yesterday, passed into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).\n\nBut it was not without controversy and drama as senators and House of Reps disagreed on what percentage host communities should get from crude oil drilled in their areas.\n\nThe bill had originally proposed 2.5 per cent Equity Share Holding for Host Communities but the joint committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream, Downstream and Gas) recommended five per cent in its final submision.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives raised the amount from 2.5 per cent to five per cent and passed the bill into law, senators from the northern part of the country rejected the five per cent recommended by its committee and insisted on three per cent.\n\nKaita Ahmed, representing President Muhammadu Buhari in the Senate, led the onslaught against the five per cent. Although senators who supported the retainment of the five per cent had their way when it was subjected to voice vote, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, however, ruled contrarily.\n\nThe development led to a rowdy session as senators mainly from the south rejected the ruling even as Lawan tried without success to restore order.\n\nNorthern lawmakers, it was learnt, felt the allocation of five per cent would deprive other states of funds accruing from oil production in the Niger Delta even as they argued that three per cent was enough based on the briefing they got from Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipreye Sylva.\n\nSenaor Albert Bassey, however, explained that the reason for recommending five per cent was to remedy unfortunate incidents that may affect the assets.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision of the Lawan-led morthern senators, George Sekibo from Rivers State raised a Point of Order. He cited Order 73, which challenges the ruling of the chairman (Mr Lawan), and requires that he put the question to vote a second time. And should his opinion be again challenged, he should call each senators name to vote.\n\nLeader of the Senate, Yahaya Abdullahi, called on Sekibo to step down the request for individual senators\u2019 names to be called to vote on the issue. Lawan also appealed to Sekibo to step down the request.\n\n\u201cThis three per cent, at least the Senate did not pass 2.5 per cent, we passed something slightly higher than that. I appeal to Sekibo to withdraw the point of order. We should not insist on dividing the Senate. It is our right,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nIn withdrawing the call for a head count, Sekibo said the decision was against the interest of the country.\n\nDeputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, appeal to his northern colleagues to retain the five per cent also crashed.\n\nThe senate went ahead to approval a Host Community Trust Fund, which would be anchored by oil and gas companies operating in the host communities for the three per cent.\n\nThere is, however, the fear that host communities in the Niger Delta may only get a meagre share of three per cent if the figure is not harmonised by both chambers.\n\nThe Senate, however, approved a 30 per cent funding mechanism for Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) profit to fund exploration of frontier basins in parts of the country where search for crude oil in commercial quantity is ongoing.\n\nThere is an ongoing search for oil in commercial quantity in some northern states but no search in any part of the 17 southern states.\n\nThe Bill has also empowered the Minister of Petroleum to exercise certain supervisory powers in the management of the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe Bill states that the Minister shall \u201cformulate, monitor and administer government policy in the petroleum industry, exercise general supervision over the affairs and operations of the petroleum industry in accordance with the provisions of this Act, report developments in the petroleum industry to the government, represent Nigeria at international organisations on petroleum matters, promote an enabling environment for investment in the Nigerian petroleum industry,\n\nThe Bill also unbundled the NNPC into two commercialised corporation.\n\n\u201cThere is established the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (the Commission) which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. There is established the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (the Authority), which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal. The Authority shall have the power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, sue and be sued in its own name.\n\n\u201cThe Authority shall be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry.

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja, Emma Emeozor\n\nFederal Government said it has launched a manhunt for collaborators of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and would prosecute them irrespective of their status in the society.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, revealed that Nigeria\u2019s intelligence and security agencies were on Kanu\u2019s trail across continents spanning two years before he was finally intercepted on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe commend the professionalism, diligence, patriotism and painstaking efforts of our security and intelligence agencies. We also thank the sister international agencies that collaborated with us to pull off this arrest.\n\n\u201cIt will interest Nigerians to know that for over two years, our security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the proscribed IPOB leader as he lived a five-star life across several countries, travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments and turning out in designing clothes and shoes.\n\n\u201cOf course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cWe can tell you that the forensic investigation carried out so far has revealed a treasure trove of information on the proscribed IPOB leader and his collaborators.\n\n\u201cWhile the investigation continues, we assure you that none of the collaborators, irrespective of their standing in the society, will be spared.\n\n\u201cThey will all face the full wrath of the law for their activities that challenge our nation\u2019s sovereignty and threaten its unity. No one, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the country.\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that many are suddenly calling for a fair trial for Kanu as if he didn\u2019t get one before he decided to jump bail and flee.\n\n\u201cHowever, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he willfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.\n\n\u201cFinally, there have been speculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed.\n\n\u201cWhat we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations.\u201d\n\nKanu, who is facing an 11-count charge of treason, treasonable felony, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms, among others, jumped bail in 2017 and left the country.\n\nAn Abuja High Court had on Tuesday granted the Department of State Services (DSS) custody of Kanu after he was arraigned and denied bail. His next appearance in court is on July 26-27.\n\nMeanwhile, a day after Kingsley, younger brother of the IPOB leader said the separatist leader was arrested in Kenya, Nairobi has denied the claim.\n\nSpokeswoman for the Kenyan interior ministry said it was not aware of the matter while the foreign affairs ministry in Nairobi did not respond to a request for comment, Reuters said. The reaction of the government of Kenya came as confusion trails the location Kanu was intercepted by security operatives.\n\nThe British High Commission in Nigeria has also said Kanu was not arrested in the United Kingdom where the embattled IPOB leader is a citizen. In a press release, the Mission said: \u201cIn response to any question on whether Nnamdi Kanu was extradited from the UK, we can reaffirm that Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested in the UK and nor was he extradited from the UK.\u201d\n\nThe UK has said it plans to seek clarification from the Federal Government, circumstances surrounding the arrest of Kanu. At a press conference on Monday, Malami break the news of Kanu\u2019s arrest saying he was intercepted following diligent intelligence by \u201cour security and intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nGovernor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has advised the Federal Government to ensure rule of law and due process is followed in Kalu\u2019s prosecution.\n\nHe said conscientious effort must be made by the Federal Government to allay the fear of some Nigerians that Kanu is not being prosecuted because he comes from a particular section of the country.\n\nGovernor Wike, who made this assertion during a television interview, explained that irrespective of the differences the arrested IPOB leader has with Rivers State government, due process must be followed in his prosecution.\n\nHe stated that for the Federal Government to demonstrate its resolve to address insecurity crisis facing the country, the same dragnet deployed to arrest Kanu must, as a matter of urgency, be extended to bandits and Miyetti Allah militias terrorising the country.\n\n\u201cWe must not make hullabaloo about the prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu. I don\u2019t agree with his principle. I have come out and said you (Kanu) cannot annex my State to be your own. But that does not mean that you\u2019ll not allow the law to take its course.\u201d\n\nThe governor insisted that government must arrest every wanted terrorist on its watchlist and ensure they are brought to book to face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say because Nnamdi Kanu is from a particular area, let us prosecute him. The same thing must apply to all other people, the bandits, Miyetti Allah.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Benue Governor, Samuel Ortom urged the Federal Government to zealously arrest leaders of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore (MAKH) same way it arrested the Biafran freedom fighter.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government has demonstrated capacity to arrest Kanu, they should also exhibit the same zeal, will and decision to arrest Fulani herdsmen terrorising our state and country.\n\n\u201cLet that be done, they are living here with us. If Nnamdi Kanu can be arrested from a foreign land. I believe that if the Federal Government can exhibit the same will, they will arrest Fulani herdsmen, especially Miyetti Allah who have owned up to the killings in Benue state and have continued to terrorise our land.\u201d\n\nOrtom, who stated this in Makurdi wondered why Miyetti Allah would brand Kanu who is fighting for the liberation of his people a terrorist.\n\n\u201cIt is laughable and unfortunate when I heard that Miyetti Allah are calling Nnamdi Kanu a terrorist. Someone who is fighting for the liberation of his people is being called a terrorist by a terrorist organisation called Miyetti Allah and Fulani herdsmen. So, the Federal Government should rise up to its responsibilities and arrest the people.\u201d\n\nThe governor, however, noted that the Federal Government, after arresting Kanu, must follow due process to ensure justice.\n\n\u2022Re-arrest won\u2019t dampen Biafra struggle \u2013MASSOB\n\nHowever, the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has said the actions of the Nigeria government and her foreign collaborators and the ordeal Kanu was going through would not dampen the Biafra struggle.\n\nReacting to Kanu\u2019s re-arrest and extradition to Nigeria, MASSOB in a statement issued by Uchenna Madu accused the Federal Government of being confusedly blind and clueless.\n\nThe group said this was because Kanu and activities of pro-Biafra agitators do not pose any danger to Nigeria\u2019s existence. The group said what poses problem to Nigeria\u2019s existence is Fulani domination of Nigerian state over the general interest of other ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu has proven to be a loved figurehead in championing the self determination struggle for the actualisation and restoration of Biafra.\n\n\u201cAs freedom can never be achieved on a platter of gold, Biafra revolutionary struggle for actualisation and restoration can never be deterred or fluctuated because of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s current ordeal in the hands of our oppressive enemy. Nigeria state will soon regret arresting him because he will become a thorn in their flesh.\u201d\n\nIt warned the Nigeria government to be careful with Kanu and accord him fair and unbiased court hearing, adding that the people of Biafra will never keep quiet over Kanu.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

He stressed that one of the operative was wounded during the operation.\n\nAfunaya gave the names of twelve persons arrested , a female inclusive, as Abdulateef OFEYAGBE\n\niAmoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K Tajudeen ERINOYEN, Diakola ADEMOLA, Abideen SHITTU\n\nJamiu NOAH, Ayobami DONALD\n\nAdelabe USMAN, Oluwafelumi KUNLE, Raji KAZEEM, Taiwo OPEYEMI and Bamidele SUNDAY.\n\nHe explained that a search was conducted in the house\n\nAfunaya\u2019s statement reads; \u201cIn the early hours (about 0134 hours) of today, 1st July, 2021, a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo a.k.a. SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place.\n\n\u201cOn approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards. Six (6) of them were armed with AK-47 gun and Three (3) others, with Pump-Action riffles.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles; three (3) Pump Action guns; thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines and five thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition.\n\nHe also stated that five (5) cutlasses , one (1) Jack knife, one (1) Pen Knife;\n\ntwo (2) Pistol holsters;one (1) binoculars ; a wallet containing Five (5) US Dollars in one (1) Dollar denomination; local and international driver\u2019s licences in his name, ATM Cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name were found.\n\nAlso discovered , he said were two (2) whistles; fifty (5) Cartridges; eighteen (18) Walkie-Talkies;\n\nthree voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour;\n\ntwo (2) Laptops (One (1) Toshiba and One (1) Compaq); and his International Passport and those of many others (as displayed here). He maintained \u201c further exploitation and forensic analysis are ongoing.\n\n\u201cAside the items recovered from the building, about thirteen (13) suspects including twelve (12) males and one (1) female were arrested and brought to Abuja. While one suspect is being profiled, the other twelve (12) paraded here are: Abdulateef OFEYAGBE,\n\nAmoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K (female)\n\n, Tajudeen ERINOYEN, Diakola ADEMOLA\n\n, Abideen SHITTU\n\n, Jamiu NOAH\n\n, Ayobami DONALD\n\n, Adelabe USMAN\n\n, Oluwafelumi KUNLE\n\n, Raji KAZEEM\n\n, Taiwo OPEYEMI and\n\nBamidele SUNDAY.\n\nHe said the briefing was to \u201cinform Nigerians and the world that Sunday IGBOHO and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. This, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by IGBOHO and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\n\n\u201cAlert foreign missions and licencing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that IGBOHO could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\n\n\u201cApprise stakeholders that the Five (5) AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building are suspected to be those collected by IGBOHO\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\u201d\n\nHe said the \u201c gun duel which lasted for an hour offered IGBOHO the chance to escape.

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) said last night that it raided the residence of the Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, accusing him and his associates of planning a violent insurrection against the state.\n\nThe secret police said its operatives raided his residence in Soka, Ibadan yesterday and arrested 13 of his associates.\n\nIt said operatives recovered seven AK-47 assault rifles, 30 fully charged AK-47 magazines and 5,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition.\n\nParading the suspects, the Public Relations Officer of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, said Igboho, in the course of agitation for self-determination, had become well-armed and a threat to public order.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe agency wishes to inform Nigerians and the world that Sunday Igboho and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order.\n\n\u201cThis, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by Igboho and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\u201d\n\nThe agency also alerted \u201cforeign missions and licensing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that Igboho could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\u201d\n\nAfunanya said the agency needed to inform stakeholders that the five AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building were suspected to be those collected by Igboho\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\n\nHe said his associates engaged the operatives in a gun duel.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe gun duel, which lasted for an hour offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho is now on the run. Igboho may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him.\n\n\u201cBut this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will surely fail him and the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\u201d\n\nHe advised Igboho to turn himself into the nearest security agency, calling also on those cheering and eulogising him to appeal to or advise him to do the needful.\n\n\u201cHe should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly,\u201d he said\n\nAfenifere, Others Kick\n\nApparently thinking that the raid was an unlawful attack, the pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO); a former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode; and the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, yesterday condemned the attack on Igboho\u2019s residence.\n\nWhile Adams claimed that eight people were killed, an aide to Igboho put the death toll at two.\n\n\u201cThe situation now is very bad. Two Yoruba sons have been killed in the house of Chief Sunday Igboho. The two bodies have been taken away by the military. We do not know of the location where they were taken to,\u201d Igboho\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Olayomi Koiki, said.\n\nThose who lost their lives were said to be relatives of Igboho.\n\nThere were bloodstains on the floor of the premises as well as some of the rooms, indicating that some persons were hit by bullets.\n\nThere were also expended bullets at the front of the house and also on the premises.\n\nSome vehicles destroyed by bullets included a Sienna bus branded with pictures of Prof. Banji Akintoye and Igboho.\n\nReacting to the incident, Afenifere and IOO had accused the federal government of being behind the attack.\n\nAfenifere in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said the manner of the attack indicated culpability on the part of the government.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe are forced into this deduction for a number of reasons. Firstly, eyewitness accounts indicated that the vehicles and uniforms of the attackers were that of the security agencies. Secondly, the failure of security agencies to confront the attackers further implicated the government. It was reported that the attack lasted for more than three hours. \u201cIgboho\u2019s residence is in a highly-populated area within minutes\u2019 reach to surrounding police stations. That no rescue team came from any of the police units, including the DSS office in Ibadan for the several hours that the attack lasted, makes it difficult not to believe that the government is complicit in the attack\u201d.\n\nIn his reaction, Fani-Kayode said two people were killed and their bodies were taken away with a large number of others arrested.\n\nHe added that Igboho\u2019s passport and travel documents were stolen together with his phones, his personal effects, computers and N2 million.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were about 100 soldiers and security agents involved and Sunday managed to escape after his boys shielded him from the bullets. They insisted that he should leave whilst they resisted the attack as best as they could and with few numbers.\n\n\u201cMy question is this: what has this man done to deserve this? There is nothing he has been asked to do in terms of keeping the peace in the South-west by the federal government and the Yoruba elders that he has not done, including guaranteeing the security and safety of the local Hausa-Fulani population, building bridges, keeping the peace and having a dialogue with other ethnic nationalities in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Aderemi, Adams said the attack was a ploy to silence Igboho from expressing his views on the state of the nation.\n\nHe, however, charged the federal government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack and to bring the perpetrators to book.\n\nIOO in a statement by Emeritus Prof. Banji Akintoye, and made available to THISDAY by his Communications Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, accused the Nigerian Army, accompanied by those he labelled international terrorists hired by the Nigerian state, of attacking Igboho\u2019s home.\n\nAkintoye also alleged that the assailants were all dressed in military uniform and spoke the French language fluently.\n\nHe stated that the gunmen killed seven occupants of the building and whisked away Igboho\u2019s wife and others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Mohammed Monguno, later told reporters that what transpired at the plenary did not actually mean that they passed it as widely reported.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the demons behind the non-passage of the bill for many years had been defeated.\n\nAlso, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare said the federal lawmakers had broken the jinx.\n\nHowever, there was uproar at the Senate as the senators disagreed on the profit share percentage to be allocated to the host communities in the PIB, before finally settling for three per cent.\n\nThe Senate passed the much-awaited PIB after a clause-by-clause consideration of all the 318 clauses of the bill.\n\nThe bill was first sent to the National Assembly in 2008 by President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, now deceased, without translating into an Act.\n\nChairman of the Senate Joint Committee on Petroleum Upstream/Downstream and Gas, Senator Sabo Nakudu, had earlier while presenting its committee\u2019s report before the Senate went into a closed-door session with the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari.\n\nThe bill had proposed five per cent of the annual profit share of the oil companies for the host communities.\n\nShortly after the Senate resumed plenary after its executive session with Sylva and Kyari, Lawan commenced the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill.\n\nBy the time he got to clause 240, which made provision for five per cent trust fund for host communities, the plenary became rowdy.\n\nExplaining why the five per cent was reduced to three per cent shortly after the plenary, Nakudu said the earlier percentage, which was 2.5 was increased to five per cent.\n\nHe added that it was reduced after Kyari explained that five per cent is a huge amount of money.\n\nAccording to him, the three per cent amounts to half a billion dollars, adding that enabling environment needs to be created to attract investors as fossil oil is fast going out of fashion.\n\nMajority of senators later voted for three per cent contribution to the host communities, following a motion by Senator Ahmad Kaita, seconded by Senator Ibrahim Gobir, for an amendment to clause 240(2) of the bill.\n\nEfforts by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, Senators James Manager, George Sekibo and Albert Akpan for an upward review were rejected.\n\nSekibo, in a move to sustain his agitation for an increase in contributions to host communities, relied on Order 73 of the Senate Rule and called for a division.\n\nBut the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, prevailed on him to withdraw his call for division and reminded him of the commitment of senators to fostering unity while keeping in mind their obligation at all times to protect the national interest.\n\nLawan also told Sekibo of the overwhelming support of the lawmakers who had earlier approved that host communities should receive remediation and relief from monies accruing from gas flaring in the PIB.\n\nSekibo then withdrew his earlier call for division. During a clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, the Senate also approved the funding mechanism of 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s oil and gas profit in the production sharing, profit sharing, and risk service contracts to fund exploration of frontier basins.\n\nIt approved clause 4 of the bill, which seeks the establishment of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission to provide technical regulatory functions to enforce, administer and implement laws, regulations and policies relating to upstream petroleum operations. The commission will, among others, ensure compliance with applicable national and international petroleum industry policies, standards and practices for upstream petroleum operations; and establish, monitor, regulate and enforce health, safety and environmental measures and standards relating to upstream petroleum operations.\n\nIn addition, the Senate also adopted the committee\u2019s recommendation to retain provisions in Clause 29 of the bill, approved the establishment of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nClause 29(3) empowers the agency to be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry in Nigeria.\n\nIts function include implementing government\u2019s policies for midstream and downstream petroleum operations as directed by the minister; and to promote, establish and develop a positive environment for international and domestic investment in midstream and downstream petroleum operations.\n\nOthers are to ensure strict environmental implementation of policies, laws and regulations for midstream and downstream petroleum operations; and to develop and enforce a framework on tariff and pricing for natural gas and petroleum products. The recommendation of the joint committee was amended in clause 52(7d) to ensure that all monies received from gas flaring be channelled for the purpose of environmental remediation and relief of the host communities as against the development of infrastructure in midstream gas operations. The Senate, however, retained the recommendation of the joint committee in Clause 53, which empowers the Minister of Petroleum Resources to incorporate Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation as a limited liability company, to be known as NNPC Limited, six months after the commencement of the Act.\n\nIt adopted clause 53 that mandates the minister, at the incorporation of NNPC Limited, to consult with the Minister of Finance to determine the number and nominal value of the shares to be allotted, which would form the initial paid-up share capital of NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Senate also approved the ownership of all shares in NNPC Limited to be vested in the government at incorporation and held by the Ministry of Finance Incorporated on behalf of the government.\n\nLawan, after the passage of the PIB congratulated the National Assembly and the Joint Committee on Downstream Petroleum Sector; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); and Gas for the \u201ctremendous and historical achievement of passing the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill.\u201d\n\nHe said the passage of the PIB was an indication that the \u201cdemon\u201d behind its non-passage in the past had been finally defeated.\n\nLawan appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to give expeditious assent to the bill when it is eventually forwarded to him.\n\nAddressing journalists on PIB after plenary, the Senate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Bashiru, said: \u201cOn the three per cent that was approved for the upstream operating expenditure, from the projection made by the NNPC GMD, who briefed us, it will amount to $502.8million for the host community development fund.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly (Senate), Omoworare, has congratulated Buhari, Lawan, and the Speaker of the House Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, on the passage of the PIB by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt should be noted that the efforts by the executive and legislature in Nigeria to put in place contemporary legislative and legal framework in the oil and gas sector has proved abortive since the year 2000; also, the non-amendment of the extant framework being the Petroleum Act of 1967, has affected the inflow of foreign direct investment as well as growth in local content.\n\n\u201cBreaking this jinx and achieving this feat is a testament that the executive and the legislature can really work together and truly engage each other, without compromising party position and individual perspective, in the most positive manner with a view to actualizing the common goal and communal good for Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, the House of Representatives y passed the PIB.\n\nIt considered and adopted the report on the PIB for passage during its committee of the whole session.\n\nThe adoption, followed the consideration of all the 318 clauses of the bill, presented by Chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee on the PIB, Hon. Mohammed Monguno.\n\nMoving the motion for the consideration, Monguno said by passing the bill into law, the House would have written its name in gold.\n\nThe 318 clauses of the bill were put to a voice vote by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase and they were unanimously adopted by the lawmakers.\n\nSpeaking after the consideration of the report, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, hailed the House for achieving the feat.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to commend the 24 wise men and the 360 members in producing this 318 sections law. In the coming week, the electoral amendment will follow suit. By the time we are done, irrespective of which side of the divide you are on, this 9th House would have done us proud and recorded on the right side of the law.\u201d\n\nBut Monguno later told reporters that contrary to what has already been reported by the media, the bill had not been passed but was considered and adopted by the committee of the whole.\n\nBut his clarification confirmed that the lawmakers may have skipped the third reading stage to pass the bill\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Bill has suffered over the years in previous assemblies. But this time around, the 9th House of Representatives decided to take the bull by the horn and passed the bill. We decided to pass it with the speed of light because of the urgency it demands. Nigeria has lost a lot in terms of direct foreign investment in our oil and gas industry, as a result of obsolete laws affecting the oil and gas industry. In abroad their oil and gas laws is in tandem with international best practices.\u201d\n\nHe added that the bill will now be scheduled for third reading and final passage and then referred to the Buhari for assent.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says they should be tried for manslaughter\n\nHints of FG\u2019s plan to borrow from Europe to fund projects if China fails\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nTransportation Minister, Hon Rotimi Amaechi, has canvassed for stiffer charges to be preferred against anyone found vandalising railway lines and facilities in the country.\n\nHe also hinted of plans by Federal Government to source for funds from Europe to fund railway expansion projects in case China was no longer forthcoming to assist in this regard.\n\nAmaechi, who spoke Friday at the weekly ministerial briefing organized by the Presidential Media Team at the State House, Abuja stressed that introducing stiffer penalties such as manslaughter charges to punish vandals will go a long way to curb the menace, which could cause a train to derail and lead to grave fatalities.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can imagine the number of people that will die as a result of that derailment. This is just because one selfish Nigerian is trying to steal track to make money. I think like other countries, I\u2019m not saying that they should be killed because there\u2019s poverty.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying they should be charged for mass manslaughter because people will die.\n\nBut again, they will tell you that manslaughter means that somebody died. If anybody dies, they should be charged for manslaughter. If nobody dies, they should be charged for stealing. That\u2019s my view.\u201d\n\nThe Minister expressed concern that railway clips were frequently stolen, resulting in huge losses in hard currency adding that he will soon meet with the Inspector General of Police with a view to providing adequate security for the rail tracks\n\nHis words: \u201cif we enforce the law on the vandalisation of tracks, it will stop. And I have asked the Managing Director of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRA) about their police. He said they were enough.\n\n\u201cI will meet the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to give us enough men and materials so that we can use them to police the tracks. Having moved from narrow gauge to standard gauge, it has become a national security issue because it\u2019s a daily movement, involving three, four, five, six trips a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the law should deal with those who break it. The law should not be quiet\u201d.\n\nThe former Governor of Rivers state further disclosed that Nigeria and China had signed a contract to manufacture train coaches locally in the country following an initial five year period of just the local assembly of the components.\n\nAmaechi, however, stated that government will not hesitate to look towards European banks for intervention if China was not forthcoming with assistance, adding that a financial firm has already expressed willingness to provide funding for some of the rail projects.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIf the Chinese don\u2019t turn up in the next few months, why shouldn\u2019t we approach the European banks to fund Ibadan to Kano? I will put that before the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cThe Standard Chattered Bank has agreed to fund Lagos\u2013Calabar, we are negotiating with them. We are negotiating Port Harcourt\u2013Maiduguri. Kano\u2013Maradi is funded by Pedy-Swiss. We would look for money from everybody.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Adedayo Akinwale\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on the aggrieved Anambra State governorship aspirants to approach the appeal committee set up by the party, instead of bringing disrepute to APC in public space.\n\nThe National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, stated this on Friday in Abuja during the inauguration of an appeal committee to hear complaints arising from the recent APC governorship primary in the Anambra state.\n\nThe committee had actually started working before it was officially inaugurated.\n\nThe secretary said the membership of the Committee was carefully selected and comprised persons of character and integrity so that those dissatisfied with the processes thus far, can approach the committee in confidence that they will get justice.\n\nAkpanudoedehe stressed that the constitution of the party, and the party guidelines for the nominations would be the reference instruments for the Committee.\n\nHe said, \u201cMay I use this opportunity to call on all those who are directly concerned with the just concluded primaries to approach this Committee to ventilate their dissatisfaction if any, instead of bringing the party into disrepute in the public space.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the recent defections of some governors, lawmakers and other political stalwarts to the ruling APC, the Governor of Gombe State, Inuwa Yahaya, has said that Nigeria can never become a one party state.\n\nHe said considering the fact that the country runs a multi-party system, a one party state will never arise.\n\nThe governor said people were joining APC because it\u2019s solid, more on ground and more transparent.\n\nHe stated: \u201cA party that is in control necessarily has to attract people that are ready to give their support and they are coming because they realise that APC is more solid, more on ground and really more transparent and open in terms of how it deals with everybody; the high and the low. That is why they are coming, so we welcome them and anybody that says no have to have a rethink because party is about people and all politicians are invited and welcome to any party that they think belongs to the right track. That is what APC is.\u201d\n\nAsked if the country was going towards one party system, the governor added, \u201cNo! As at the last count, INEC, and mind you, the process of registration is there free for all. Anybody could go to register a party provided he meets the constitutional provisions and the regulatory requirements of INEC. There are parties and there will still be more parties. So, why one party? I think that will never arise. Not in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the assignment given to the committee, Yahaya stressed that the committee had already gotten petitions from the aspirants.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe shall trash them and find solution to all claims or observations made by the contestants. Five petitions are with us right now and we are given time within which we shall conclude with them.\u201d\n\nOther members of the committee are: Sen. Julius Ucha, Hajia Maryam Salifu, Alh.

          "text": "The lawyers of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, who has been detained by the Department of State Services, Abuja, have met him where it was confirmed that he was indeed arrested and detained by the Kenya government for a week, before being handed over to the Nigerian authorities.\n\nThe lawyers, led by Barrister Ifeanyi Ejiofor, who met Kanu on Friday, noted that his heart had enlarged by 13 per cent due to the dehumanising treatment and torture in Kenya and he now needs \u201cimmediate proper medical examination and attention for him.\u201d\n\nEjiofor in an update added that Kanu had been arrested since June 18 in Kenya.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy Client - Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was actually abducted by the accursed Kenya's Special Police Force on the 18th of June 2021 at their International Airport, and consequently taken to an undisclosed residence under dehumanising conditions.\n\n\u201cHe was tortured and subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment which worsened his health condition. He was illegally detained for eight good days in Kenya before being transferred to their Nigerian counterpart.\n\nUpdate.\n\nMy Client- Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was actually abducted by the accursed Kenya's special Police Force on the 18th of June 2021 at their International Airport, and consequently taken to an undisclosed residence under dehumanizing conditions.He was tortured and subjected to.1/5 \u2014 bar ifeanyi ejiofor (@EjioforBar) July 2, 2021\n\n\u201cHe was purportedly investigated on a bogus charge while in their custody, ostensibly, awaiting to be handed over after their findings proved him innocent of all the spurious allegations. They later beckoned on their Nigerian Counterpart to take over.\n\n\u201cThe Kenya government was deeply involved in the abduction, detention and ill-treatment of my Client before the illegal handover to their Nigerian counterpart.\n\n\u201cA scan of his heart showed that the heart has enlarged by 13% due to the dehumanizing treatment meted to him. There will be need for immediate proper medical examination and attention for him.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu conveyed his goodwill message to all IPOB family members worldwide, and craved for your unrelentless prayers. We are going back to the Court for the needful. Other details cannot be entertained here. His fortified legal team will address these infractions at the proper forum as we progress. Other details on our legal strategy, may not be made public.\n\n\u201cWith Chukwuokike Abiama on our side, Victory is assured. For if God Almighty be for us, who can be against us? \u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported today that the Kenya Government strongly denied that it or its security officials were involved in the arrest and extradition of Kanu.\n\nSee Also International Present Proofs That We Were Involved In Nnamdi Kanu's Arrest\u2014 Kenyan Authorities Tell Nigerians\n\nThe Kenyan High Commissioner to Nigeria, Wilfred Machage, who addressed a press briefing in Abuja, had stated that anyone or group with proofs that Kenyan security officials, agencies or the government arrested Kanu should be free to share them.\n\nMachage added that Kenya, like several other countries, have been named in recent days as where Kanu was arrested, saying Nigerians should demand the true answers from their government, who made the arrest and not from Kenya.\n\nMachage had said, \u201cOne, Nnamdi Kanu; I want to address this allegation by denying that Kenya was involved in the alleged arrest and extradition to Nigeria of Mr Kanu, and I repeat, I want to address this allegation by denying that Kenya was involved.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are fictional, imaginary and exist to fuel antagonistic feelings between the southern section of the Nigerian people against the Kenya peole, and indeed many countries have been accused.\n\n\u201cRwanda, Czech Republic, Britain, Ethiopia and God knows which other country. I want to challenge anyone with facts relating to this arrest through Kenya to present these facts.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "FairMoney, like many other Nigerian fintechs, started out in the lending business and is about completing its evolution into being a full-fledged digital bank.\n\nToday it announced a $42 million Series B round. It was led by Tiger Global Management with existing investors like DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest participating.\n\nThe investment comes after FairMoney raised $11 million Series A two years ago and $16 million in total within its first four years.\n\nFor Tiger Global which led the round, this is its fourth investment in an African startup after iRoko (2013), Takealot (2014) and Flutterwave (2021). Notably, this is the first time the investment firm is investing in two African startups within a year. A sign of its renewed interest in the African continent after a long hiatus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,\u201d Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement. \u201cWe were impressed by the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale.\u201d\n\nFairMoney\u2019s Performance\n\nFounded in 2017 by Laurin Hainy, Matthieu Gendreau, and Nicolas Berthozat, FairMoney started its operations in Nigeria before expanding to India last year.\n\nFrom having a little over 100,000 users in its first year of operation, FairMoney has grown to have 1.3 million unique users who have made more than 6.5 million loan applications. Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million.\n\nWithin the short time its being in India, the company has processed more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users.\n\nThis year, FairMoney achieved one of its crucial goals by acquiring a microfinance bank license in Nigeria. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.\n\nLooking forward\n\nComing off a fantastic 2020, the company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans this year. It\u2019ll finance this by raising bonds.\n\nFairMoney has come a long way since it started as a credit provider, it\u2019s ambition according to co-founder Laurin Hainy is that \u201cby the end of the year, its customers will have a full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also working on a number of additional services including savings, stock trading, and crypto-trading products. These are subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nWith this new funding, rather than expanding into other countries, FairMoney wants to focus and consolidate its position in Nigeria and India. While it\u2019s not expanding further geographically, its talent pool is, with about 150 open positions.\n\nFairMoney is not alone in its ambitions to dominate the Neobank scene in Nigeria, Kuda in March raised $25 million.\n\nWith more players coming onto the Neobank scene in Nigeria, one might get a feel that it\u2019s a space that\u2019s getting crowded but the fact that about 56% of Nigerian adults are unbanked hints that there\u2019s room for many to play in this space.\n\nShare this article",

In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor two children to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand. With the largest growing youth population in the world, a digitised Africa will be a sight to behold.\n\nWith Faith Keza, Irembo could be at the front of that movement.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kenyan eCommerce startup, Copia Global, has announced the expansion of its services to Uganda. Having established its presence in the Kenyan market, where it claims to serve over one million customers, the startup has its sights on Uganda\u2019s growing middle class.\n\nCopia Global operates a different model from most eCommerce platforms. Rather than depending on a website, it uses a network of agents spread across the country. When customers need an item, they visit an agent with a digital device to place their order.\n\nAfter placing their order, the agent sends it to Copia Global, who processes and delivers it within two days when the customer returns to pick it up. By adopting this model, the company can serve people who do not own digital devices or cannot access the Internet. Interestingly, it does all this using USSD technology.\n\nWhile the startup has a website, it is mainly for customers who live in urban areas. This way, they can order goods and have them delivered to people living in rural communities where Copia Global has agents.\n\nThis model is perfect for Uganda, where despite 47% of the population owning mobile subscriptions, only 12 million Ugandans use the Internet. However, its combination of an online and offline model is not exactly novel. In 2019, eCommerce giant, Jumia, partnered with Vivo Energy to use its service stations as pick-up and drop-off points for customers.\n\nAccording to Founder and Chairman, Tracey Turner, \u201cUganda has one of the fastest-growing middle classes in the world with a hardworking population and a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. Copia is designed specifically to serve this high growth but underserved consumer base who want access to high-quality products at the best prices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, the startup has raised $53 million in funding from investors, including LGT Lightstone, Endeavor Catalyst, and Goodwell Investments.\n\neCommerce startups in Africa have primarily struggled to show a viable market for their services, with Konga sold in 2018 and Jumia\u2019s business struggling despite listing on the New York Stock Exchange. While models like Copia Global\u2019s that seek to serve low-income consumers might seem like the way to go, eCommerce startups need to serve a larger market to make as much revenue as the giants do.",

          "text": "OneWattSolar, a startup using digital solutions built on a Blockchain platform to provide off-grid renewable energy has issued a \u20a610 billion ($24.33 million) bond to deploy clean energy across sub-Saharn Africa.\n\nAnnounced July 1, 2021, the Green Bond Issuance programme, includes a seven-year Green Sukuk issue of \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million).\n\nThe bond issuance was led by Comercio Partners, Lagos-based investment bank and supported by Nigerian Shari\u2019ah complaint fund manager, Marble Capital Limited.\n\nWe spoke with Jubril Adeojo, co-founder and COO of OWS and he says issuing bonds will help accelerate growth and \u201cattract institutional investors interested in investing in green economy\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, the kind of projects the company is embarking on requires long-term funding, making the bond issuance a logical move.\n\nInterestingly, this is the first Corporate Green Sukuk in Africa and the first Corporate Green Bond for an off-grid renewable energy project.\n\nAdeojo says OWS is setting a standard for corporate organisations hoping to get to issue a Green Sukuk Bond.\n\nWhen asked what qualified the company for the bond issuance, he attributed it to the bankable business model and track record in Nigeria\u2019s renewable energy space.\n\nHe also stated the role of Financial Sector Deepening Africa (FSD), \u2014 UK-funded development agency strengthening financial markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 in providing technical assistance to OWS.\n\nWhy Sukuk? The co-founder says it is to \u201cmake history and appeal to Islamic investors to participate in the issuance.\u201d\n\nOne company, several partners\n\nIn describing OWS\u2019s business model, Adeojo says it\u2019s like Uber, but for energy services.\n\n\u201cWe partner with a lot of solar companies across the continent that carry out installation and maintenance. What we do is to provide the hardware like, solar panels, inverters, and software to enable the hardware run seamlessly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are some of the software used by OWS to facilitate services like payments and monitoring.\n\nBreaking down the process of how OWS operates, Adeojo says there are brokers that source for clients and solar companies that install hardware.\n\nThrough this model he claims, the company creates jobs for young engineers.\n\nSupervised by the solar companies, these engineers can also be part of the installation process individually. In addition, they\u2019ll also be in charge of maintenance, meaning they\u2019ll keep earning as long as the installed hardware is in use.\n\nThe vision of the renewable energy company is to deploy 14,000 megawatts of off-grid renewable energy across sub-Saharan Africa to decarbonise the region\u2019s energy sector.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN) Fact Sheet on Climate Change, \u201cAfrica is the continent\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,\u201d with 0.8 metric tons of carbon emissions per capita in the year 2000.\n\nHowever, Adeojo says OWS has partnered with solar companies and installers to deploy over 50 megawatts of renewable energy across Nigeria.\n\nWith this issuance, the company can accelerate its vision of installing 14,000 megawatts of clean energy in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time an African startup has resorted to bonds for funding, it\u2019s a relatively new phenomenon.

          "title": "There\u2019s no such thing as a bad investment \u2013 TEN13\u2019s Stewart Glynn talks startup funding",
          "text": "As the pace of innovation in the African tech ecosystem ramps up, more attention would be given \u2014 and for a good reason \u2014 to the brave founders and innovators building Africa\u2019s future. However, angel investors and venture capitalists are a similarly courageous group of individuals who are seldom celebrated.\n\nTwice a month, we speak with an angel investor or venture capitalist backing Africa\u2019s innovators to draw insights from them. For this week\u2019s edition, I talked to Stewart Glynn, a Partner at TEN13, an Australian venture capital firm.\n\nGlynn grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital and most populous city, in an entrepreneurial family. When it was time for university, he went to Australia to gain a degree in business, banking, and finance at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nAfter that, he worked with General Electric and KPMG. During this time, he did a lot of work around helping businesses develop sustainable structures and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis time in the corporate sector exposed him to technology and its disruptive effects in various industries. He was approached by Steve Baxter, \u2018Shark\u2019 on Shark Tank, and an Australian serial entrepreneur who founded SENet and Pipe Networks, which was acquired for about $400 million.\n\nBaxter had started investing in technology startups through his family\u2019s office, Transition Level Investments, but wanted to do more and so he tapped Glynn. Together, they invested in about 40 ventures around the world.\n\nIn December 2019, after wondering how to institutionalise their investments, Baxter and Glynn decided to start TEN13. Having seen the value that Baxter could bring with his experience as a founder, they chose to do things differently.\n\nRather than raise a seed fund, TEN13 has a network of over 200 entrepreneurs and corporate executives who supply more than funds to the startups that they invest in. These investors provide the companies with an extensive network and advice as they navigate their startup journeys. Investments at TEN13 are made on a deal by deal basis.\n\nSince its launch in the last 18 months, TEN13 has deployed about $20 million in 13 startups, including Australian edtech unicorn, Go1; fintech startup, ImaliPay; and Africa- focused fintech unicorn, Chipper Cash.\n\nAccording to Glynn, the idea is to get behind visionary founders at the earliest stage and provide them with the resources to take their companies to the next level. The average ticket size is between $250,000 and $1 million, with the possibility of more investment further down the road.\n\nOn bad investments and common mistakes founders make\n\nFor now, Glynn explains that the goal is to fund ten companies every year. An arduous task, as he claims they get about 70 to 80 startups looking for funding monthly. When I asked if there were any deals they had missed out on that hurt, he explained it is the norm in venture capital.\n\n\u201cIn our game, it\u2019s really about having a framework for decision making because as early-stage investors, you\u2019re making decisions with limited data. As an investor, you want to see a lot of companies in the anti-portfolio because that means you are seeing the right deals,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn investor\u2019s anti-portfolio are the deals which they pursued but did not invest in, either of their own volition or because other investors shut them out.\n\nAccording to research, nine out of 10 startups fail. Knowing this, I asked Glynn how TEN13 deals with investments that do not go according to plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as a bad investment. We understand that while the companies we back have a high potential for success, there\u2019re a lot of reasons why startups fail. When we invest in startups, we provide support for the founders to ensure that the startups have a good chance of success,\u201d he says.\n\nMost founders have grand plans to take on the world at the early stage, but without previous startup experience, they are likely to make mistakes. Glynn advises that this is the point when they need to narrow their focus and not spread themselves too thin \u2014 something they make sure these startups know.\n\nInstead, he advises that they identify one thing that would put them on the right path and focus on doing it for the next three to six months.\n\nHow to reach TEN13\n\nFor founders looking to get TEN13 on board as investors, he recommends that they reach out via email [email protected] or LinkedIn. He stresses that they are sector-agnostic and back founders who are building products for a global market. With a renewed focus on emerging markets, he recommends that founders in these markets building remarkable products should reach out to him.",

          "text": "After ending the year 2020 with a record 50 percent gain, the Nigerian stock market has been unable to sustain the momentum in the first half of 2021 as investors\u2019 appetite for stocks continues to wane on rising yields.\n\nCompared with peers, Nigerian stocks have underperformed with a YTD (year-to date) performance of -5.9 percent as against Ghana, Kenya and South Africa whose stocks were up 36.3 percent, 14 percent and 11.53 percent, respectively, in the first half of the year.\n\nYinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance, explains that unlike last year when interest rates were low and investors had to troop into the stock market, they have moved out this year as interest rates continue to rise.\n\nDespite the inflation rate that has slowed for the second successive month in May and oil price that touched its highest since 2018 at $76, it has been unable to spur investor\u2019s appetite for Nigerian equities as they are more interested in the fixed income space.\n\nHowever, while some companies have seen their share plunge significantly in the first half, some shares have rewarded investors with eye-popping gains.\n\nHere are the best performing stocks in the first half of 2021:\n\nLASACO Assurance\n\nLASACO\u2019s share price is the best performer as it stormed 329 percent higher in the first half of 2021 (H1 2021). The insurance and financial service company opened the year with a share price of N0.35 and rose to N1.50 as at June 3oth 2021.\n\nMorison Industries\n\nMorison\u2019s share price came next with a 186 percent gain in H1 2021. Morison began the year with a share price of N0.49 per share and closed its last trading day in June at N1.40 per share, ranking it second-best on the Nigerian exchange group in year-to-date performance.\n\nMorison Industries plc specialises in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical, hygiene and care products.\n\nRead also: International Breweries declares N 136.8bn revenue\n\nChampion Breweries\n\nThe Champion breweries share price came next with 144 percent gain. The beer maker\u2019s share opened the year at N0.86 and jumped to N2.1 as at June 30th 2021.\n\nSince Heineken\u2019s indirect acquisition of additional shares in Champion Breweries through Raysun Nigeria Limited on the 8th of January 2021, buying interest by investors have continued to prop the shares of the company.\n\nRoyal Exchange\n\nThe share price of Royal Exchange, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost financial services groups offering general and health insurance, also gained by 135 percent in H1 2021. The insurer\u2019s share price began the year at N0.26 and has surged to N0.61 in the review period.\n\nRegency Alliance Insurance\n\nRegency Alliance ranked the fifth best performer in H1 2021 with 109 percent gain. The insurance company began the year with a share price of N0.22 and surged to N0.46 per share on the last day of June 2021.\n\nVitafoam\n\nVitafoam\u2019s share price recorded a 97 percent gain in the first half of the year. The manufacturer of foam products saw its share price rise to N15.4 per share compared to N7.8 per share at the beginning of the year.\n\nConsolidated Hallmark\n\nConsolidated Hallmark Insurance\u2019s share price also gained 88 percent in the first half of 2021. The insurer\u2019s share price opened the year at N0.32, surging to N0.60 as of 30 June 2021.\n\nSeplat\n\nSeplat shares have gained 72 percent, ranking it 8th among the top performers in terms of year-to-date performance.\n\nAs oil prices continue to rebound, investor\u2019s buying interest resumed and this pushed Seplat\u2019s shares up to N690 per share as at June 30th 2021 from an opening price of N402 per share.\n\nLinkage Assurance\n\nLINKASSURE began the year with a share price of N0.52 and has since gained 61.54 percent on that price valuation, ranking it 9th on the NSE in terms of year-to-date performance. This stock gained 40 percent in the last one month alone\n\nMutual Benefits Assurance\n\nMBenefit ranked the 10th on the NSE in terms of year-to-date performance with 59.26 percent gain. The insurance company began the year with a share price of N0.27 and surged to N0.43 per share as at June 30th 2021.\n\nOther stocks that outperformed the NSE year-to-date return\n\nWhile some stocks did not make the top 10 list, they have outperformed the NSE year-to-date return -5.9 percent. These stocks include McNichols (56.86%), Guinness (52.63%), Eterna (47%), WAPIC (42.5%) and Honeywell Flour Mill (39.17%).\n\nOutlook for H2\n\nOn the outlook for the second half of the year, investment analysts have projected that investors might flock back if companies post impressive half-year performance and for dividend benefits.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for equities in the second half is not very positive, the only catalyst for a slight rebound might be positive earnings by companies which could stimulate investors interest,\u201d an equity analyst who prefers anonymity says.\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital, a Lagos-based investment house, have also projected that investors might flock back to reap dividend benefits.\n\n\u201cDespite the yield retracement in the fixed income market, we do not think investors should give up on the possibility of a market rally in the second half of the year as we still see scope for positive market performance.\n\n\u201cGiven that the second half of the year is associated with the declaration of interim dividends, we envisage that investors will flock into stocks with attractive dividend yields as we inch closer to the half-year earnings season,\u201d they note.",

          "title": "BusinessDay @ 20: Going strong the way we started",
          "text": "BusinessDay is 20 years old today. This newspaper, which is now the primus inter pares, announced its entry into the global financial journalism space exactly 20 years ago today.\n\nWith a strong ambition to change the economy, financial, business and industry narratives in Nigeria and the West African sub-region for the better, a carefully constituted five-member board comprising Pat Utomi as chairman, Frank Aigbogun (publisher/CEO), Alhaji Ibrahim Ida and Abiola Otaniyi as members, and Akinniyi Sowumi as the pioneer editor, BusinessDay on July 1, 2001, started a journey that today has made it the premium source of business and financial news and market intelligence for local and foreign investors across West Africa.\n\nOver that 20-year period, the publication has continued to seek to deliver the promise it set out at the start, as articulated by the pioneer chairman, Pat Utomi.\n\nRead Also: BusinessDay, NSE hold Nigerian Investor Value Awards today\n\nOn the front page of that historical publication, which we have reproduced the cover in this edition, Utomi wrote: \u201cAll great societies, as all outstanding enterprises, are the end result of a great idea. Ideas do not grow in the void. Often they come from bringing the intellect into the path of the flow of quality information, news, analysis and hard statistical data that BusinessDay promises to deliver.\u201d\n\nIn this 20th year, we are proud of the history we created and are part of as we have not only chronicled the very best of business stories in the period but shaped policies, shared insights, and converged the best global thought leaders in our conferences. Though coming out of the most disruptive economic and technology shifts in human history following Covid-19, we are as excited about the future that we see as we are so proud of the past that birthed us.\n\nAs we celebrate 20 years of impact journalism in Nigeria, many things have changed, while many things remain the way they were. Perhaps nothing symbolizes that the Nigerian economy has not changed in dramatic ways like the stories we carried in our first edition. Indeed, the first headline was \u201cGoods inspection cripples Benin Republic\u201d, written by Seidi Mulero. The story focused on the impact of the full inspection policy that covered land, sea and air on the level of patronage of ports in Benin Republic, a story that we believe will resonate with those that believe, even 20 years after, that Nigeria continues to fail to find a workable solution to the single West African market.\n\nAlso in the same edition, the central feature was on \u201cFaces of (Nigeria\u2019s) battered currency\u201d, showing that the story of the naira\u2019s weakness did not start in the last six years. Twenty years ago, though oil prices were rising, the country grappled with severe balance of payment problems, epitomized by the staggering over $30 billion debt.\n\nOther stories in the first edition were no less symptomatic of the way we have covered business since. Oluwole Elisha wrote \u201cBanks reject foreign exchange requests\u201d, exposing how banks rejected requests for foreign exchange from their customers as a demand management approach by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the banks.\n\nAnother banking-related story in the first edition was the declaration of N1.25 billion profit by the then Intercontinental Bank Plc headed by Erastus Akingbola. The story was written by Remi Njoku. Intercontinental Bank ran into trouble in 2009 after a special audit of the commercial banks in Nigeria by the Central Bank (CBN) listed it among nine banks found to be under-capitalized and badly managed. Intercontinental Bank was later taken over by Access Bank in 2013.\n\nAbba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, was celebrated in BusinessDay\u2019s maiden edition as that day coincided with his return to the United Bank for Africa (UBA) as vice chairman. The appointment came shortly after he retired as the managing director and chief executive of the same bank.\n\nThe strong presence of indigenous Nigerian banks on the African continent owes its success to the policy implemented in early 2000\u2019s which was the focus of the maiden edition of this newspaper. Writing for the Finance Beat with the headline \u201cBanks go for strong hands\u201d, Remi Njoku reported how banks had shifted attention to quality-oriented and well-trained staff in a bid to raise their standard to global standard.\n\nOther epic stories in the maiden edition focused on the different sectors and players in the Nigerian economy and the global developments as at that time.\n\n\u201cIs Coke losing flavour?\u201d was another important story that featured in BusinessDay\u2019s maiden publication. It was written by Anthony Osae-Brown, who later rose through the ranks to become the editor of the newspaper.\n\nThe maiden publication also featured Virgin Atlantic\u2019s maiden flight into Nigeria. Headlined \u201cA flight of Virgin\u201d, the story written by John Osadolor, now the deputy editor and head of BusinessDay\u2019s Abuja office, projected that Virgin Atlantic would challenge British Airways on the Lagos-London route with lower fares.\n\nThere was a photograph of Musiliu Smith, the then Inspector General of Police, and Gaius Obaseki, who was then the group managing director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), conferring with each other. Undoubtedly, the two institutions headed by both men, then and now, remain very sensitive in Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay also reported that \u201cNNPC reviews cash call payment\u201d in the maiden edition. \u201cThis move, it was learnt, is the apex oil industry authority\u2019s plan to reduce delay in payment of cash calls and avoid losses to government,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs a follow-up, BusinessDay also carried a story on why the country\u2019s oil and gas sector had not witnessed much progress. It was an interview with Chamberlin Oyibo conducted by Olusola Bello. Oyibo, in the interview titled \u201cGovernment interests derail oil industry\u201d, identified government running of oil and gas business as against providing policy guidance as the bane of the nation\u2019s oil and gas development.\n\nFrom first edition also, BusinessDay\u2019s Africa ambitions were clear. There was a section on Africa where the newspaper asked the question: \u201cWho speaks for Africa?\u201d A lot has since changed positively for the African continent with the elections of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian, as director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), and Ngozi-Okonjo Iweala, a Nigerian, as director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), who are currently projecting the image of Africa on the global scene.\n\nMany things have also changed within.

          "title": "Nigeria struggles with poverty that private sector can fix",
          "text": "Between 1958 and 1962, an estimated 40 million people starved to death in China as a result of the largest socialist experiment in history.\n\nMao Zedong, who was the leader of China, had called this experiment the \u201cGreat Leap Forward,\u201d which was aimed at rapidly transforming the economy from agrarian to industrial, but for China it was a disaster. What was supposed to create wealth for the people had impoverished them like never before.\n\nPrivate farming was abolished and rural farmers were forced to work on collective farms where all production, resource allocation, and food distribution was centrally controlled by the Communist Party.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was officially halted in January 1961 after three brutal years of death and destruction.\n\nRead Also: How China, India, Vietnam lifted millions out of poverty\n\nThe outcome of the experiment was predictable, because it matched the pattern of events unfolding in the \u201cterror famine\u201d of Ukraine in 1932, and in the Soviet Union in 1933, events that exposed the shortcomings of socialism and the government\u2019s omnipotent grip over an economy.\n\nChina had a rebirth after Deng Xiaoping rose to power in China and implemented a series of far-reaching market-economy reforms that fostered private ownership of property, boosted economic growth, created jobs and reduced poverty.\n\nBy 1983, the process of de-collectivising Chinese agriculture was almost complete. Mao\u2019s great socialist experiment, which had cost so many millions of lives, was over.\n\nInitially, the growth in private ownership across China was driven by increasing numbers of small-scale entrepreneurs setting up businesses, which were only allowed to employ a maximum of seven people. The increasing erosion of this socialist system that exclusively permitted public ownership under the management of a state-run economic planning authority was accelerated by the creation of Special Economic Areas.\n\nChina has been the better for its encouragement of private enterprise. Poverty has reduced from nearly 90 percent in 1980 to under 2 percent, according to latest World Bank figures, lifting over 800 million out of poverty in the process.\n\nRead Also: Buhari\u2019s denialism will compound the poverty crisis\n\nThe lesson here for a country like Nigeria, which is grappling with high levels of poverty, is that creating an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive while reducing the role of government in the economy may be the best way out of deepening poverty.\n\nWith 87 million Nigerians living in poverty, Nigeria is home to the highest number of poor people globally. The World Bank even predicts that the number will increase by another 7 million by year-end. That means that by the end of 2021, Nigerians living below $1.90 per day could rise to 94 million, that is the population of the United Kingdom and Australia combined.\n\nThe government in 2019 announced an ambitious plan to lift 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\nThe big question however is if the government is doing the right things to achieve this target. China, for one, was able to achieve such a feat but Nigeria is not exactly following in the steps of China by increasingly liberalising the economy and encouraging private enterprise.\n\nIf anything, the Nigerian government is seemingly tightening its grip on the economy when it should be giving the private sector a bigger role to play.\n\nThere are examples.\n\nThe state-owned oil company is now the sole importer of petroleum products into the country, displacing private importers who have been unable to sustain imports due to an unrealistic petrol price peg.\n\nThe Central bank is increasingly playing the role of financial intermediary in the place of commercial banks.\n\nThe government is also crowding out the private sector with its sheer size of borrowings. The government could raise close to N3 trillion this year from the domestic capital market alone, three times the N1 trillion that corporates are forecast to raise.\n\nTalks of a national airline are also never off the table in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently set up a committee on poverty composed of government officials.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t lift people out of poverty by setting committees,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, an economist and a partner at PWC Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need an enabling environment for businesses to thrive,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\n\u201c50 percent of MSMEs in sub-Saharan Africa are in Nigeria even though we account for 20 percent of the population, this tells us that we need to provide an enabling environment and millions can be lifted out of poverty because if each of the MSMEs in Nigeria can employ one extra person we can create jobs and lift millions out of poverty,\u201d Oyedele added.\n\n\u201cMany small businesses just need the government to get out of the way,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nThe private sector creates the bulk of jobs in Nigeria but data from the World Bank which shows that the ease of doing business in Nigeria ranks among the lowest globally (despite recent gains) means the private sector is constrained.\n\nNigeria improved its ranking on the latest World Bank ease of doing business ranking by moving 15 spots to 131 in 2020, but the country still has anti-business policies according to analysts.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the government focus on improving the ease of doing business to reduce poverty,\u201d a bank CEO told Business Day.\n\n\u201cIf doing business was easy in Nigeria, we can lend more affordably and more businesses can expand and employ more people, but that\u2019s not the case today with the many risks in the economy,\u201d the bank CEO, who did not want to be named said.",

Charles Akhigbe, at the stakeholders\u2019 sensitization meeting at the Government House, Benin City, said the port would improve economic activities in the state and create thousands of jobs for Edo people, as well as Nigerians.\n\nStakeholders at the meeting include Okomu Plc, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Rongtai Industry, ESIPO and Zanithcarex Int\u2019l Limited, among others.\n\nAccording to Akhigbe, \u201cThis is a sensitization meeting to bring all the potential port users in Edo State together under one room, to sensitize them about the AMES-Edo Inland Dry Port and the commencement of operations at the dry port because they are the ones to use the dry port and need to know the stage the dry port is and at what stage to come in and commence operation with us.\n\n\u201cIt will be a customs port, and a lot of activities at the Lagos Port will be done here at Edo State, yielding huge resources for the state and the federal government. This is the first phase and other phases will follow for bigger companies, medium-sized companies and small-scale businesses that are all over the state, to start thinking export.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cWe need to galvanise our people here in the state to take advantage of putting quality edible products together, as we are blessed with agricultural products in Edo, as the port will enable the exportation of quality, safe food products to Africa and the rest of the world directly from Edo State.\n\n\u201cA lot of Edo businessmen are going through hard times through the Lagos Port. But with the Dry Port, no need to go through the Lagos Port but the Edo Dry Port. We need to make sure that the potential port users are aware of the development.\u201d\n\nAkhigbe said AMES-Edo Dry Port was established to provide a one-stop cargo reception and clearance facility to boost exports from and imports into Edo State particularly, Nigeria\u2019s South-South, South-East and some states in the middle belt region, by by providing proper handling and logistics services.\n\n\u201cArrangements are ongoing with the relevant authority for a dedicated cargo airplane that will be able to carry a maximum of 60 tonnes using both the Edo and Delta State Airports.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government is facilitating the Ossiomo-Power to be connected to the Dry Port for 24/7 electricity supply to reduce cost and ensure that end-users and other stakeholders benefit.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday urged the Federal High Court in Abuja to dismiss an application filed the former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, to stop his retrial.\n\nEFCC\u2019s lawyer, Rotimi Jacobs, scoffed at the seeming irony in the application suggesting that Mr Kalu was trying to take benefit of the Supreme Court judgement which nullified his earlier trial, and simultaneously trying to avoid the burden of retrial also ordered in the same apex court\u2019s verdict.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff (Orji Kalu) and his co-defendant are enjoying the benefit of the Supreme Court judgement, but they are avoiding the burden that comes with it.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court ordered that plaintiff and his co-defendant be tried denovo (afresh). So, there must be a conviction or an acquittal by a competent court,\u201d Mr Jacobs said.\n\nThe Lagos Division of the court had on December 5, 2019, convicted and sentenced Mr Kalu, currently Chief Whip of the Senate, to 12 years imprisonment, and his co-defendant, Udeh Udeogu, to 10 years in jail for diverting Abia State\u2019s funds to the tune of N7.1 billion.\n\nHowever, citing technical grounds, the Supreme Court on May 8, 2020, set side the conviction and sentence, and ordered that the defendants be tried afresh.\n\nBefore they could be re-arraigned, however, Mr Kalu, the incumbent Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate, filed an application to stop his retrial.\n\nAt the hearing of Mr Kalu\u2019s application Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday, the prosecuting lawyer, Mr Jacobs, in an impassioned submission, took the court through the tortuous journey of prosecuting Mr Kalu and his co-defendant.\n\nThe trial lasted 12 years before their convictions were upturned by the apex court.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue like that; everybody must be ready to bear the consequences of their actions. Filing a case to terminate the lifespan of another case is an abuse of court process.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, we (the EFCC) filed a charge against the defendants. It was fraught with series of preliminary objections that went up to the Supreme Court until 2016 and they were all dismissed,\u201d Mr Jacobs noted.\n\nWhile closing his final argument on Friday, Mr Jacobs urged the judge to discountenance the argument of the former governor\u2019s lead lawyer, Awa Kalu, that his client had spent five months in prison after a protracted trial, and that a retrial would amount to a \u201cdouble-jeopardy\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy lord, because he (Mr Kalu) has spent five months in prison, therefore his retrial should be aborted,?\u201d Mr Jacobs queried.\n\nKalu\u2019s argument\n\nWhile adopting his final written addresses, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Awa Kalu, said the Supreme Court never ordered the retrial of the erstwhile governor of Abia State as he was not a party in the matter that nullified the entire proceedings at the trial court.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court never ordered the retrial of the plaintiff (Mr Kalu). Our application is anchored on the fact that my client was tried, convicted and sentenced. He spent five months in prison. Therefore, a retrial will amount to double-jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff stood trial for 12 years. His trial terminated in 2019. I urge the court to grant our application,\u201d he said.\n\nDate for ruling\n\nAfter listening to the lawyers representing the parties on Friday, the judge, Mr Ekwo, gave a tentative date of September 20, for the verdict.\n\nHe said the court would notify parties in the suit of change in date if the judgment would not be ready before then.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa, was seen conferring with Rotimi Jacobs, shortly after the suit was adjourned.\n\nConvicted and subsequen release\n\nMr Kalu was tried based on amended 39 counts in which they were accused of stealing and mismanaging funds belonging to Abia State during his days as governor between 1999 and 2007.\n\nHe was tried alongside his company, Slok Nigeria Limited, and Udeh Udeogu, who was Director of Finance and Accounts at the Abia State Government House during Mr Kalu\u2019s tenure as governor.\n\nIn December 2019, Mohammed Idris, then a judge of the Federal High Court in Lagos, (now a Justice of the Court of Appeal) sentenced Mr Kalu, to 12 years in prison for N7.65 billion fraud.\n\nMr Udeogu was jailed 10 years.\n\nThe court also ordered Slok Nigeria Limited to be wound up and its assets forfeited to the federal government.\n\nBut the Supreme Court on May 8, 2020, set side the conviction and sentence, on the grounds that the judgment of the trial court delivered by Mr Idris after he had been elevated to the Court of Appeal bench, was unconstitutional.\n\nEjembi Eko, a Supreme Court judge, who delivered the lead verdict, held that a Justice of the Court of Appeal cannot operate as a judge of the Federal High Court.\n\nHe ruled that section 396 (7) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015, on which the then president of the Court of Appeal, Zainab Bulkachuwa, relied on to authorise the trial judge to return to the high court to conclude the trial was unconstitutional.\n\nHe then ordered the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to reassign the case to another judge of the court for retrial.\n\nFollowing the nullification of his conviction by the Supreme Court, the former governor filed an application at the federal court seeking an order for his release from the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS), Kuje, Abuja.\n\nA judge, Mohammed Liman, in June 2020, granted the application and ordered the immediate release of Mr Kalu from custody.",
          "summary": "\u201cThe plaintiff (Orji Kalu) and his co-defendant are enjoying the benefit of the Supreme Court judgement, but they are avoiding the burden that comes with it.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court ordered that plaintiff and his co-defendant be tried denovo (afresh).\nSo, there must be a conviction or an acquittal by a competent court,\u201d Mr Jacobs said.\n\u201cMy lord, because he (Mr Kalu) has spent five months in prison, therefore his retrial should be aborted,?\u201d Mr Jacobs queried.\nEjembi Eko, a Supreme Court judge, who delivered the lead verdict, held that a Justice of the Court of Appeal cannot operate as a judge of the Federal High Court.",

          "text": "Aloy Ejimakor, one of the lawyers of Nnamdi Kanu has alerted the British Government that his client, a British citizen was forced back to Nigeria, illegally, by security agents of the Government.\n\nKanu reportedly travelled to Kenya, using his British passport.\n\nBut he was intercepted on the way and brought to Nigeria, similar to the way Buhari headed military government planned to kidnap in UK and crate a former transport minister, Umaru Dikko in 1984.\n\nEjimakor, in a letter to the British High Commissioner in Nigeria, Ms Catriona Laing CB, asked that \u201cMr Kanu be granted every Consular assistance to which he is entitled as British citizen.\u201d\n\nEjimakor\u2019s letter came ahead of reports that the DSS, which is holding Kanu, has granted Kanu access to another lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor.\n\nHere is the letter:\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nCatriona Laing CB\n\nBritish High Commissioner to Nigeria\n\nBritish High Commission\n\nPlot 1137\n\nDiplomatic Drive\n\nCentral Business District\n\nAbuja\n\nDear Madam High Commissioner\n\nRE: Urgent Request For Consular Assistance To OKWU-KANU, Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny (A British Citizen)\n\nWe are Solicitors to above-named British citizen, on whose behalf and Instruction we write this Letter to request an urgent Consular assistance to him.\n\nMr. Okwu-Kanu (aka Nnamdi Kanu) is the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Director of Radio Biafra, both of which are corporate citizens of the United Kingdom.\n\nMr. Kanu resides in the United Kingdom, from which soil he departed on an overseas travel on or about June 19, 2021 on a British Passport No: 556543086 (copy of biographic page attached herewith).\n\nWe are reliably informed that while he was on said overseas travel, he was intercepted in Kenya by Nigeria\u2019s foreign security agents and brought to Nigeria against his will on or about June 27, 2021 and \u2018arraigned\u2019 before the Federal High Court in Abuja without benefit of Counsel on June 29, 2031. Currently, he is being detained in the custody of the Directorate of State Security Services (DSS) in Abuja.\n\nYour Excellency, permit us to point to a few legal, political and diplomatic issues that have been implicated in this matter. They are:\n\nMr Kanu is a British citizen who was traveling on a valid British passport when he was seized in a third country and forcibly brought to Nigeria. Such act constitutes an unlawful rendition of a bonafide British citizen.\n\nHe was not traveling on Nigerian passport or the passport of any other country, including that of Kenya.\n\nThere is no extant Order of extradition by any British Court or any other foreign Court (including Kenya) and we are informed that there is no pending extradition proceedings standing against him in Britain or Kenya.\n\nThere is no deportation Order by any Kenyan Court or other authority that made him subject to deportation. But if there was, the country of his deportation should have been Britain on which passport he was travelling. Deporting him to Nigeria just because he was borne in Nigeria, but not travelling on her passport, is unlawful under international law.\n\nThe enterprise upon which Mr Kanu is engaged, which is: seeking the restoration of the defunct State of Biafra through a referendum is a protected political opinion (i.e self determination) under British and Nigerian Laws, where it is enacted at CAP A9, Article 20, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\n\nIn our view, the manner of his interception and forcible deportation to Nigeria is extra-legal and does not comport with the pertinent international laws and treaties to which Nigeria is subject.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, we hereby make the following Prayers:\n\nThat Mr Kanu be granted every possible Consular assistance to which he is entitled as a British citizen.\n\nThat Mr Kanu be categorized as a high profile political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience and be thus rendered the highest diplomatic protection under municipal and international laws.\n\nThat the Nigerian authorities be prevailed upon to immediately allow access to Mr Kanu by his Lawyers, Doctors and Family members.\n\nThat the Nigerian authorities be prevailed upon to immediately avail Mr Kanu the opportunity of being taken to any hospital of his choice for medical examination.\n\nThat the British authorities file a Diplomatic Note or other legal process with Nigeria\u2019s Federal High Court and the Office of the Attorney General of Nigeria indicating her sovereign interest in Mr Kanu\u2019s matter.\n\nThat the British authorities declare that Mr Kanu is not a criminal but a person who possesses a political opinion the Nigerian authorities are seeking to suppress by means of punishment of some sort.\n\nThat the British authorities urgently demand the unconditional release of Mr Kanu from detention.\n\nWhile we await your urgent and most favorable considerations of our Prayers, please be assured of our highest esteem for Your Excellency, the High Commission and the British Government.\n\nSincerely:\n\nADULBERT LEGAL SERVICES\n\nAloy Ejimakor, Esquire",

They are bought overseas. So, we buy them in dollars.\n\n\u201dPart of the solution is something called anti-theft clips. But, they are more expensive. It is three times more expensive than the current one. But it\u2019s better.\n\n\u201dWe are now replacing them with anti-theft clips in Lagos-Ibadan. All other constructions will now be anti-theft. With anti-theft, you can\u2019t open it. You can\u2019t remove it.\n\n\u201dWe need to now go back to the Abuja-Kaduna line and change them to anti-theft clips.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t know why we have not made that decision earlier, because we have changed up to 10,000 to 15,000 clips in six years.\u201d\n\nThe minister advocated the death penalty for anyone caught vandalising railway facilities, so as to deter others, while decrying what he described as light punishment for those caught buying vandalised narrow gauge and other stolen railway facilities.\n\n\u201dI think the law should deal with those who break it. The law should not be quiet. I don\u2019t know what the law says, but a Chinese company arrested for buying those tracks got away with only a N200,000 fine.\n\n\u201dThe law should give us much more than that.

Oladapo Daramola, in Lagos.\n\nDaramola said that the Church expressed its displeasure over the decision of the British Church in favour of same-sex marriage.\n\nAccording to him, the position of MCN was made known by its Prelate, His Eminence Chukwumerije Kanu-Uche, in a message he shared with members, on July 2.\n\nKanu-Uche announced that MCN was cutting formal ties with the British Methodist Church (BMC) due to the latter\u2019s decision to vote in favour of same sex marriage at the just-concluded conference.\n\n\u201cI wish to let you know that I was invited to the British Methodist Conference this year, 2021 but I was duly represented by Rt. Rev. S. R. Nortey.\n\n\u201cHe was part of the Conference and he has given me preliminary information and report.\n\n\u201cI have requested him to publish and circulate the full report on the SSM to the Conference office and all of us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that what the British Methodist Conference had done was predicted by John Wesley that, \u201ca time will come when the Methodist Church will exist as a dead sect, having the form of religion and denying the power thereof unless they continue with the spiritual fervency with which they first started.\u201d\n\nThe prelate reminded the members that the British Methodist Church was no longer the mother Church of MCN.\n\n\u201cShe is only a sister Church. MCN gained autonomy in 1962 and became autocephalous in 1963. So, we can part ways with the British Conference and have nothing to lose.\n\n\u201cI only pity those romancing with them because of pecuniary interest.\n\n\u201cSuggestion to write or visit the British Methodist Conference is an insult on Methodist church.\n\nHe, however, said the Church will wait to receive a detailed report from the accredited delegate to the Conference and take an informed decision at Aug. 2021 consultation.\n\n\u201cAs a remedial measure let every Bishop, and Archbishop tell our members that MCN does not support gay or same-sex marriage,\u2019\u2019 Kanu-Uche said.\n\nNigeria has enacted a law making same-sex marriage illegal and punishable by imprisonment.",

We just heard sporadic gunshots all around the main house during which they killed one of the bodyguards of Sunday Igboho named Adogan.\n\n\u201cSensing the gunmen had gained entry, he (Igboho) himself engaged them in a shootout when he realised they had already killed some of his boys.\n\n\u201cBefore the gunmen made their way into the inner rooms. There was a lady in a mask who led them in. She was calling occupants of the house by their names. That is to show that an insider gave them the information they relied on.\n\n\u201cThe lady started shouting the names of close aides of Igboho, she asked them to kill every living thing sighted on the premises. They killed his Alfa while praying.\n\n\u201cThey took away about N3m from his (Igboho\u2019s) room as well as his jewelry. The assailants killed five persons and took away their corpses. Some ladies, who are wives of chief\u2019s aides, were also taken away. They took away the CCTV box so that we won\u2019t playback.\n\n\u201cWhile Igboho escaped, out of the hanger, they whisked away one of his wives and 13 other aides including one of his bloggers named Lady K.\n\n\u201cWhen Sunday Igboho found out they were there to kill him, he had to enter another room and disappeared. We can\u2019t tell his whereabouts as I am speaking with you. The gun duel lasted an hour.\u201d",

          "text": "American sprinter Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, expected to be one of the biggest draws at the Tokyo Olympics, will miss the 100 metres at the Games after accepting a one-month ban for testing positive for cannabis during her U.S. trials victory in June.\n\nThe United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) confirmed the suspension on Friday, though the 21-year-old still has a chance of running in the Olympic relay events.\n\nThe positive test came at the U.S. Olympic trials when Richardson underlined her credentials as a serious gold medal contender by winning the 100m in 10.86 seconds.\n\nThe women\u2019s 100m event in Tokyo starts on July 30, two days after Richardson\u2019s ban ends but the adverse finding means her Olympic qualifying results at the trials, which offer automatic places to the first three qualified athletes in each event, are annulled.\n\n\u201cThe rules are clear, but this is heartbreaking on many levels,\u201d USADA CEO Travis Tygart said. \u201cHopefully, her acceptance of responsibility and apology will be an important example to us all that we can successfully overcome our regrettable decisions, despite the costly consequences of this one to her.\u201d\n\nRichardson said in an NBC Interview on the Today Show on Friday that her action came while she was dealing with the news of the death of her mother.\n\n\u201cLike I tweeted yesterday, I\u2019m human. We are human, I want to be as transparent as possible with you guys whether it\u2019s good, whether it\u2019s bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut there will never be a steroid attached to the name Sha\u2019Carri Richardson. The charge and what the situation was marijuana.\u201d\n\nUSADA said that her ban was reduced to one month because she had used cannabis out of competition and it was unrelated to sport performance. She also successfully completed a counselling program regarding her use of the drug.\n\nThe ban could leave Richardson, the fastest American woman this year with a time of 10.72 seconds, clear to race in the 4x100m relay at the Olympics in the first week of August, if she is one of two athletes selected by USATF on top of the first four trials finishers.\n\nCannabis is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) but if athletes can prove that their ingestion of the substance was unrelated to sports performance, then a suspension of three months rather than the usual two or four years is imposed.\n\nIf an athlete is willing to undertake an approved treatment programme in collaboration with their national anti-doping body, then the ban can be reduced to one month.\n\nRichardson was in Oregon when she used the drug, where it is legal. \u201cI know what I did, I know what I\u2019m supposed to do\u2026 and I still made that decision,\u201d she said.\n\nRichardson could also appeal any sanction to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), while the Athletics Integrity Unit could appeal to seek a longer ban. An AIU spokesperson said that they had requested the case file from USADA but could not comment further until the relevant information has been considered.\n\nRichardson was aiming to become the first American woman to win the Olympic 100m title since Gail Devers in 1996 after posting 10.72 seconds in April \u2014 one of her five runs under 11 seconds this season.\n\nHer performances, brightly coloured hair and self-confident statements have helped her attract a huge social media following, though she has also been criticized for working with coach Dennis Mitchell, the former Olympic 100m finalist and relay gold medallist who served a two-year ban for excess testosterone.",

          "text": "Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has challenged the Federal Government to also arrest members of armed Fulani groups for carrying out attacks on farming communities in parts of the country.\n\nOrtom said such a move is imperative even as the country\u2019s food sufficiency policy is currently being threatened by the willful killings across the nation.\n\nGovernor Ortom who made the call in Makurdi, during the flag-off of the 2021 subsidized fertilizer sale at 50% per NPK 50kg bag from the initial twelve thousand Naira to Six thousand Naira, said he has no problem with the arrest of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, but the fight against terrorism and other crimes would only be seen to be unbiased if armed herders who have been killing innocent citizens are also apprehended.\n\nWhile quoting President Muhammadu Buhari as admitted recently that herdsmen occupying the forests and terrorizing the people are not Nigerians, Ortom wondered why no effort has been made to bring these herders to justice when the very citizens the president pledged to defend are now victims and IDPs in their own country.\n\nOrtom\u2019s comments come a day after Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State stated that it is not enough for the Federal Government to arrest Nnamdi Kanu, while leaders of other notorious groups are roaming wild and free.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018How Will Nigerians Feel?\u2019 Wike Rules Out Defecting To APC\n\nKanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB), was rearrested, brought back to Nigeria, and re-arraigned on Tuesday, June 29.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Governor Wike said for justice to be said to have prevailed, the Federal Government must ensure that the leaders of other groups that have been linked to killings and unrest must be arrested and made to face the law.\n\nWike who on Thursday was a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, said in the case of Kanu, due process must be followed so that justice may come full circle.\n\n\u201cI have said as governor of Rivers State, I do not believe in Kanu\u2019s principles or the way he wants to actualize Biafra. I have said that Rivers State is not part of Biafra.\n\n\u201cHowever, having arrested him, the due process of the law must follow. You cannot just say that because you have arrested him therefore you will not allow justice to prevail. You must follow the due process of law.\n\n\u201cAnd again, do not do it as if all our target is against a certain section of the country because it is not only Nnamdi Kanu we are talking about as regards insecurity in the country. We have bandits, we have Miyetti Allah who have caused a lot of problems, so government must endeavour to go after the heads of these organizations and associations and arrest them and bring them to book,\u201d Wike stated.\n\nThe governor was of the opinion that if the government toes his advice, then Nigerians will be able to say that of a truth, justice has been done.\n\nHe added that a failure to see that the other arrests are made will only suggest that the move is targetted at just one section of the country, a situation which Wike says will breed issues over injustice and debates regarding marginalization.",

          "text": "Italy beat Belgium 2-1 in a pulsating Euro 2020 quarter-final in Munich on Friday to set up a last-four clash with Spain, who needed penalties to get the better of 10-man Switzerland.\n\nLorenzo Insigne\u2019s brilliant strike proved to be the winner for Italy, who extended their national record unbeaten run to 32 matches.\n\nRoberto Mancini\u2019s men will face Spain in the first semi-final on Tuesday at Wembley.\n\n\u201cWe deserved to win. The players were extraordinary,\u201d Italy coach Mancini told Rai.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that we suffered in the last 10 minutes because we were tired. They were good, we could have scored a few more goals.\u201d\n\nBelgium and Italy were the only sides to win all 10 games in qualifying and the only teams along with the Netherlands to win every match in the group stage.\n\nThe Azzurri, whose only European title came in 1968, started brightly and thought they had struck first when Leonardo Bonucci put the ball in the net, only for VAR to rule the goal out for offside.\n\nNicolo Barella did give Italy the lead in the 31st minute with a fine solo goal though, jinking between two defenders and hammering a shot into the far corner past Thibaut Courtois.\n\nThe Italians were in dreamland when Insigne curled home a wonderful long-range strike into the top corner shortly before half-time.\n\nBut Belgium gave themselves hope in first-half stoppage time through a Romelu Lukaku penalty after Jeremy Doku was shoved over in the box by Giovanni Di Lorenzo.\n\nThe Belgians had their moments in the second half, with Lukaku denied by some desperate last-ditch defending.\n\nDoku fired over after a mazy run as the world\u2019s top-ranked side piled on the pressure, but Italy held on to reach the semis for the sixth time.\n\nSpain edge out valiant Swiss\n\nEarlier on Friday, Spain, champions in 2008 and 2012, beat Switzerland 3-1 on penalties after their quarter-final tie in Saint Petersburg finished 1-1 at the end of extra time, with Mikel Oyarzabal scoring the winning kick.\n\nLuis Enrique\u2019s side appeared to be coasting as Jordi Alba\u2019s shot deflected in off Denis Zakaria for an own goal to put Spain ahead in the eighth minute.\n\nHowever, the Swiss had caused a sensation by eliminating world champions France in the last 16 and they battled back to equalise midway through the second half when a disastrous defensive mix-up between Spain centre-backs Aymeric Laporte and Pau Torres allowed Xherdan Shaqiri to score.\n\nSwitzerland then held on through extra time after midfielder Remo Freuler was sent off in the 77th minute for a challenge on Gerard Moreno.\n\nThey had converted all five of their penalties in the shoot-out against France and this time they were given a head-start when Sergio Busquets hit the post with Spain\u2019s first effort.\n\nRodri also failed to score for Spain but Unai Simon saved from Fabian Schaer and Manuel Akanji before Ruben Vargas blazed over.\n\nVirus concerns in Russia\n\nOyarzabal\u2019s kick allowed Spain to go through and help banish the memory of their defeat on penalties in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup against the hosts in Russia.\n\n\u201cUnai (Simon), I\u2019ve seen him stop a lot of penalties with Athletic Bilbao, and I see him training with us\u2026 he\u2019s a specialist,\u201d said Spain boss Luis Enrique.\n\nFriday\u2019s game went ahead in Saint Petersburg despite major concerns about a surge in coronavirus cases in the Russian city, fuelled by the Delta variant.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Russia reported 679 coronavirus deaths over the previous 24 hours, setting a pandemic high of fatalities for the fourth day in a row. Saint Petersburg recorded 101 deaths.\n\nAn attendance of almost 25,000 watched the game in the Krestovsky Stadium, which has welcomed some of the largest crowds permitted at this pandemic-affected European Championship.\n\nThe remaining quarter-finals will be played on Saturday, when England \u2014 fresh from beating Germany \u2014 play Ukraine in Rome.\n\nEngland may not have many fans in the Stadio Olimpico due to Italian coronavirus rules which mean all arrivals from the United Kingdom have to quarantine for five days.\n\nDenmark play the Czech Republic in Baku exactly three weeks on from Christian Eriksen\u2019s cardiac arrest in the Danes\u2019 first match at the tournament.\n\nEriksen was discharged from hospital less than a week after his collapse after having a defibrillator implanted to regulate his heart rate, and without him Kasper Hjulmand\u2019s team have rallied to reach the last eight.\n\n\u201cWe will play with the heart of Christian Eriksen. He is the heart of the team still and with that heart and without fear, we will try,\u201d said Hjulmand.\n\nAFP",

It was the 10th own goal of the tournament \u2013 more than at all the other Euros combined.\n\nHoping to win their first of four quarter-final appearance in major tournaments, Switzerland deservedly levelled in the 68th minute when Xherdan Shaqiri cashed in on a mix-up in the Spain defence.\n\nThe Swiss cause was complicated by Remo Freuler being shown a straight red card in the 77th minute, yet they held on to force the extra period and somehow survived a Spain onslaught to make it to spot-kicks.\n\nDespite beating France 5-4 on penalties in the last 16 by scoring all their kicks, only Mario Gavranovic could beat Simon and the Swiss were left heartbroken, still waiting to win a European Championship quarter-final.\n\nSpain, though, are rewarded with a trip to London\u2019s Wembley Stadium to face either Belgium or Italy and are dreaming of a first major final since winning Euro 2012.\n\n\u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t miss and luckily the ball went in. On the way to the spot many things went through my head but I knew exactly what to do,\u201d said Spain forward Oyarzabal.\n\n\u201cI told Simon it was going to be his day. When Busquets missed I told Simon that he was going to save three.\u201d\n\nKeeper Simon added: \u201cFootball has been fair to us as we are the deserved winners.\u201d\n\nWhile Spain prevailed, this was an extraordinary effort from Switzerland, who ended the game without their three best midfielders as Granit Xhaka was suspended, Freuler had been sent off and then Shaqiri hobbled off injured.\n\nSwiss keeper Yann Sommer then produced more heroics to add to his superhuman efforts against France, making save after save as Spain overwhelmed their opponents in extra time but failed to score.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of the team, what we\u2019ve achieved here with the whole country behind us,\u201d said Sommer.\n\nSimon was eventually named man of the match but said opposite number Sommer had deserved it instead.",
