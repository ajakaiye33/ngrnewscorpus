          "text": "Minister of State for Education, Chief Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government, today, said it stopped negotiations with bandits because the kidnappers used the money from ransom to equip and rearm themselves.\n\nThe Minister of State for Education, Chief Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba disclosed this while fielding questions from journalists at the end of the Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the First Lady\u2019s Conference Room, Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAsked on what the government was doing over the video that went viral where some of the kidnapped students in Kaduna State were being tortured by kidnappers, he said that efforts were being made to ensure that the students were rescued.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTruly speaking, it is disheartening anytime any of our students are taken at any point, I can assure you that the federal government is doing all that it can. We have held several meetings with our security personnel and that whole region.\n\n\u201cInsecurity at the school level, you may understand stems from insecurity around the area. Before we had Chibok, there was Boko Haram in the area. It is the success of the military in more or less, incapacitating Boko Haram in the Northeast that led to some level of insurgents in the Northwest.\n\nALSO READ: ONDO 2020: We fought a good fight \u2014 Jegede\n\n\u201cAnd as bandits appeared that they\u2019ve started striking randomly at some of our schools from Jengave, Kangara. You know, everywhere. And the places where they\u2019ve had to go, we\u2019ve pursued them. But the containment policy of the military is actually in response to what we also did as the humanitarian element that surrounds it because the way the military will engage bandits once they have our citizens will not be the same way they will engage them ordinarily.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, they may not just go into the forest shooting at everything or everybody they see. And that has enabled the bandits to use some of our citizens as human shields. We are constrained to stop negotiations with bandits because we\u2019ve seen that every time they get any payment, it leads to further escalation because they reequip and they rearm and then they go back.\n\n\u201cBecause if you notice what happened from the kidnap at the College of forestry, in Kaduna, this was prior to the kidnap at the Baptist College and at Usman Polytechnic before they got the university children. Now, there is none of our students that will be held that we\u2019re happy at all. It doesn\u2019t matter which level. One is too many at any time.\n\n\u201cSo yesterday (Tuesday) the military returned to have our children that they were able to rescue. We\u2019ve seen the videos you alluded to, and while we cannot attest to their veracity with how authentic there is still concern, and we are in touch with the military authorities. They are in continuous pursuit of them.\n\n\u201cI was in Katsina to discuss with the detachment that is overseeing that area and all the way to Buni Yadi in Kebbi state where we have some of our children still held. Tigana boys are the ones in Niger state, the Islamiya school.\n\n\u201cWe are continuously engaging, there is no such thing as federal government not engaging, almost day and night we are engaging. From anywhere that we are in the world we\u2019re trying to engage and I\u2019m just trying to assure Nigerians that as distressing as it is, we are on top of it. And we will keep doing all that we can possibly do to get our children and keep our students safe.\u201d\n\nAsked the measures put in place by the federal government to ensure its schools are not attacked by bandits, he said, \u201cI had already said that the whole of government approaches to security exercise is not just limited to our schools.\n\nALSO READ: PDP: I\u2019ve no hand in Secondus\u2019 ordeal- Atiku\n\n\u201cYes, the federal government owns a few federal colleges around Nigeria, out of the 25,000 secondary schools, the federal government owns only 120 of them. And we are constantly policing each of our parameter areas. As far as we\u2019re concerned, we have policemen, we have Civil Defence people, we are collaborating with the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Police appears to have the personnel, boots on the ground everywhere.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not limiting ourselves to our own institutions at all, that we\u2019re looking at the security as a national policy is a whole of government engagement. And we already had worked out with the rest of the governors and security operatives around the country on how to do this. And I just explained that if you look at a place like Kaduna state, with 512 secondary schools, we\u2019ve had to look at those who are most prone, which from our analysis are exposed, girls secondary schools with boarding facilities are most at risk.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019ve done is to look at the radius from response time at the security agency stations to where the schools are, and if exceeds the maximum reaction time that the military and us have worked out, we close down those schools and have them come and recite with or co-locate them with schools that are within the prescient of what we determined are safe at the moment.\n\n\u201cIf you go to Sokoto State, for instance, we\u2019ve done buzzers we\u2019ve done alarm systems, we\u2019ve done perimeter monitoring, we\u2019ve done community engagement platforms, we\u2019ve done the SBMC procedures, which we put on school management bus and then attach security compliance officers alongside them, we are engaging everyone.\n\n\u201cWell, if you look at what we\u2019re doing in Borno, state, and all other places where we are at risk, because even in reopening the Chibok school if you see what Governor Babagana Zulum did there, what we did was to, first of all, get all the security apparatus around the area to be able to stay with response zones.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has also expanded its own forwarding basis. And if you understand some of the military intelligence that they use those to gather, those are forwarding basis so that before there are preemptive stack around the areas where people may not ordinarily congregate, and then isolate the forest reserves that are on the far belt of the Nigerian West Wing, where you see the continuous forest stretches that they\u2019ve now put in military installations to interrupt them so that there is no continuous flow for any engagement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s been a reduction in the past few days. But I\u2019m not saying that we are unchallenged but I am saying we are working to continuously engage them. Like I said, that\u2019s the function of government problems will not go away. But if you have hired us as managers, and what we can do at the moment, is keep managing the situation I work at it.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The pan Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, has praised the two Nigerian judges who delivered judgments on two cases involving the Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo also known as Igboho and his detained aides on Wednesday.\n\nAfenifere\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, urged the government to comply with the court rulings.\n\nHe noted that those responsible for the execution of the rulings should be sanctioned if they fail to comply.\n\nJustice Oladiran Akintola of the State High Court in Ibadan and Justice Obiora Egwaatu of a Federal High Court, Abuja, had on Wednesday, gave separate rulings in respect of Igboho and his aides respectively.\n\nThe verdict by Justice Akintola granted an ex-parte motion restraining the Directorate of State Services, DSS, and the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, from arresting, intimidating, harassing and blocking bank accounts of Igboho.\n\nJustice Akintola also restrained the agencies of government from freezing the accounts of the activist, and where this had been done, it must be de-frozen according to the ruling.\n\nRestructure Nigeria before 2023 \u2013 Afenifere charges Buhari\n\nSimilarly, Justice Obiora Egwaatu of a Federal High Court, Abuja, also granted bails to the 12 aides of Igboho who were arrested on July 1, by DSS operatives during a raid of his residence in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nReacting, Ajayi commended the judges for delivering such rulings.\n\nIn a statement he signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, Ajayi said: \u201cThe verdicts given by Justices Oladiran Akintola and Obiora Egwaatu further reinforce our confidence in the judiciary. We call on the officials and government agencies concerned to comply with the court\u2019s rulings.\n\n\u201cIt took valiant legal efforts of Barrister Pelumi Olajengbensi to counter the efforts of the DSS lawyer, Barrister I. Awo who tried to stop the suspects from being granted bails.\n\n\u201cAfenifere saluted the courage of Justice Obiora Egwaatu for granting the bails especially given the fact that the suspects have been in the custody of the DSS for 34 days without being charged to court.\n\n2023 presidency: North\u2019s four-year claim after Buhari can\u2019t stand \u2013 Afenifere\n\n\u201cThis is against the expressed provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which, in Section 35(4), stipulates that a suspect be charged to court within 24 hours of arrest\u201d\n\nAfenifere praised Justice Egwaatu for insisting that all the detainees be brought to court when the DSS was literally playing hide and seek with their fate.\n\n\u201cIn a saner clime, their initial submission of not knowing where some of the detainees were should earn the officials concern sanction. They did so all in an attempt to prevent the detainees from getting justice.\n\n\u201cWe salute Justice Egwaatu for standing firm and for eventually granting the detainees bails.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere spokesman added that since it is the Constitution that stipulates the time period of 24 hours within which a suspect must be charged to court after arrest, \u201cany officer or agency of government that contravenes this aspect of the law must be sanctioned severely to serve as a deterrence to others. It is the failure to sanction erring officials of government in the past that emboldened others to trample on the fundamental human rights of Nigerians\u201d.\n\nAjayi also gave kudos to Justice Akintola for granting the prayers of Igboho\u2019s lawyer, Barrister Yomi Alliyu in the course of arguing the N500 billion case he instituted against the DSS for damages caused when the agency forcefully invaded his client\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cThe verdicts Justices Akintola and Egwaatu confirm the exhortation that the court is the place to go when one\u2019s right is infringed upon.\u201d",

We cannot allow this quagmire to continue because 2023 is near\u2026\u201d it was gathered.\n\nMeanwhile, the battle to control the party before the national convention stems from tendencies in the two major political blocs involved in the formation of the APC; the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nThe CPC, it was gathered, is now bent on producing the new national chairman of the party, with the argument that the ACN has had its fair share of producing national chairmen of the party in time past while the ACN faction is insisting that the CECPC should be dissolved as keeping them in place would jeopardise APC\u2019s chances in future elections.\n\nAn influential minister is leading the charge for the CPC bloc in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court judgement has exposed the underbelly of the APC. The minority judgement has shown that this is a fight between the ACN and the CPC. This is the end-game between the two powerful blocs in the APC.\n\n\u201cSome party leaders are asking that Buni should step aside and the national caucus should appoint a new caretaker committee, whose committee would be short, its mandate clearly spelt out, conduct credible congresses nationwide including the national convention, within a stipulated and publicised timeframe,\u201d a party chieftain explained, yesterday.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Rose Ejembi, Makurdi\n\nTussle for the control of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) got messier, yesterday, as some members of the National Working Committee (NWC) moved against the National Chairman, Uche Secondus.\n\nThe National Youth Leader, Sunday Ude-Okoye, confirmed to journalists, at the party National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, that there was a split in the NWC as no fewer than 10 members were against the continuation of Secondus as national chairman.\n\nThis is as seven deputy national officers have served the NWC a 30-day resignation notice. They include Diran Odeyemi, deputy national publicity secretary; Ahmed Bello, deputy national legal adviser; Umoru Hadizat, deputy national women leader; Divine Amina Arong, deputy national auditor; Hassan Yakubu, deputy national organizing secretary; and Irona Alphonsus, deputy national financial secretary.\n\nHowever, Secondus, in a swift reaction, said he remains in control of the leadership of the PDP. He spoke through his media aide, Ike Abonyi.\n\n\u201cI want to assure members of the party that the structure of the party is intact and Prince Secondus is the national chairman and anybody who resigns will be filled the next day and this party will work to victory in 2023 there is no going back about it.\n\n\u201cAll those who are looking for interim government few months to general election are taking us back to Egypt and nobody is ready to go back to Egypt. We have passed through this road before and we do not want to go back there.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun gathered that amidst rising tension in the opposition party, the PDP Governors Forum, has scheduled to meet on August 9 to fashion the way forward. The meeting is expected to take a decision on Ude-Okoye, who stormed out of a meeting of the NWC and demanded immediate resignation of Secondus. He called on PDP governors and other leaders to rise up and rescue the party. He threatened to resign within four days if Secondus does not quit.\n\n\u201cMr. Uche Secondus, the national chairman of the party is incompetent of managing the affairs of this party, he lacks capacity to manage PDP. There is a sharp division in our NWC right now; not only me, many more NWC members are more aggrieved than myself.\n\n\u201cToday, I have asked him in our NWC meeting to resign his position because he cannot lead this party to victory.\n\n\u201cI am also asking the leaders, the governors, the founding fathers, the youths, the women to rise up to rescue our party from the hand of incompetent leader like Secondus because he is not willing to take us to anywhere.\n\n\u2018Seven deputies have already resigned their positions because of Secondus. Many more people are also going to resign in the NWC. Right now, I can tell you that not less than eight to ten persons within the NWC members are very aggrieved.\n\n\u201cI am here to make it very clear to all Nigerians that if Secondus does not resign from the party, I am going to leave the party for him to eat the party and own the party. The governors, if they don\u2019t wade into this matter right now, I assure Nigerians that within the next three, four days, my letter will be public.\u201d\n\nHowever, a highly placed source told our correspondent that the notice of resignation by the deputy national officers was part of a grand plot to force Secondus out before the expiration of his tenure on December 10.\n\nThe source confirmed that apart from Ude-Okoye, who has threatened to resign, three other NWC members, including the National Secretary, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri, the National Auditor, Mai Adamu Mustapha and the Deputy Chairma, North, Suleiman Nazif might resign in the next couple of days. The plot is to create a crisis situation so as to replace the NWC with a caretaker committee, which will preside over the December national convention.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that already governors elected on the platform of the PDP are divided with majority of them in support of the party chairman.\n\nThe source listed governors allegedly opposed to Secondus to include Nyesom Wike, Seyi Makinde and Ahmadu Fintri of Rivers, Oyo and Adamawa respectively. Governors with him, according to the source, include Godwin Obaseki, Edo; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi,Enugu; Dori Douye, Bayelsa; Samuel Ortom; Bala Mohammed, Bauchi and Darius Ishaku, Taraba while Ifeanyi Okowa and Emmanuel Udom of Delta and Akwa Ibom are said to be indifferent.\n\nIt was gathered that the Sokoto Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who is chairman of the PDP governors is calling for caution. Tambuwal, it was also gathered, is proposing that rather than sack the NWC before the end of tenure, the party can fasttrack the conduct of the national convention.\n\nHowever, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party has activated its internal conflict resolution mechanism immediately it got the notice of resignation from the deputy national officers.\n\n\u201cWe call on all the leaders, stakeholder and members of our great party to remain calm as we collectively resolve these issues.\u201d\n\n\u2022National Reconciliation C\u2019tte meet in Ibadan\n\nMeanwhile, the National Reconcilation Committee under the chairmanship of former Senate president, Bukola Saraki, met with Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, and some aggrieved members of the party in the state towards brokering peace.\n\nThe committee met with Governor Makinde at the Governor\u2019s Office in Agodi, Ibadan, and thereafter met with some aggrieved members at Carton Gate Hotel, Idi-Ape, Ibadan. The third meeting, which was an enlarged one held in front of the Presidential Lodge, Government House, Oke-Oyinbo, Agodi, Ibadan, comprising both the aggrieved and non-aggrieved members of the party in the state.\n\nSaraki was accompanied by former Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim; former governor of Cross River State, Liyel Imoke; and former leader of the House of Representatives, Mulikat Adeola-Akande, who is also part of the aggrieved members of the party in the state.\n\n\u2022Vote of confidence in Ortom\n\nThe party has passed a vote of confidence on Governor Samuel Ortom and reaffirmed its support for him as leader of the party in Benue State.\n\nIts state chairman, John Ngbede, moved a motion for the vote of confidence at an expanded caucus of the Party which held at Government House on yesterday and was chorused by all other caucus members in the affirmative.\n\nHe posited that the PDP has total confidence in the ability of the Governor to lead the party to victory in the 2023 general election.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022APC faces \u2018legal ditch\u2019 over Supreme Court ruling in Ondo, legality of Buni\u2019s leadership called to question\n\n\u2022PDP in crisis of confidence, plagued by defections, resignations\n\nChuks Okocha and\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nFor the two main political parties in the country \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 the road to 2023 appears inauspicious. Both parties are not only bogged down by leadership crises, but they are also plagued by seemingly intractable survival battles. Strangely, since the APC was coupled together on February 6 , 2013, by the different tendencies that came together, it has never been able to form a Board of Trustees.\n\nThe ruling party is today facing stringent legal complications, which have thrown its leadership into confusion since last weekend, after a Supreme Court judgement in the Ondo State governorship election sounded the alarm. PDP, too, is not only contending with a crisis of confidence but it is also desperately afflicted by a spree of defections by governors, and lawmakers elected on its platform, which has been compounded by yesterday\u2019s resignations of top ranking party officials.\n\nThe reality of the delicate state of things in APC did not dawn on majority of members until the Supreme Court judgement in the Ondo State governorship election petition. The judgement suggested that the party would have lost the state to PDP had the opposition party\u2019s governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, joined APC\u2019s National Caretaker Committee Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, in the suit. .\n\nThe technicality of the case had split the seven-man Supreme Court panel to a four-three majority decision, with the minority judgement led by Justice Mary Odili, arguing that the apex court should have sacked Governor Rotimi Akeredolu since Buni acted on behalf of the party. But the majority judgement delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim contended that since all the issues revolved around Buni, he should have been joined for the argument to be valid.\n\nThe crux of the debate followed the position held by some members of the party that as governor of Yobe State, an executive position, Buni could not at the same time act as the APC chairman, another executive office. They alleged that Buni contravened both Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 (iv) of the APC constitution.\n\nBut Buni and a few other like-minded party faithful disagreed and despite a plea by majority of party members to suspend last weekend\u2019s congresses for fear of the unknown, the Caretaker Committee went ahead with the exercise.\n\nTHISDAY had reported earlier this week that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, acting on the instruction of President Muhammadu Buhari, had made desperate moves, after a meeting of all lawyers in the cabinet, to call off the congresses. This was for the fear that the hint from the Supreme Court judgement in Ondo State could come back to haunt the party.\n\nBut from all indications, reason is believed to have started prevailing, as governors elected on the platform of APC and other stakeholders are now considering the way forward. Their options are believed to include the possibility of cancelling the congresses to save the party from a myriad of potential future legal challenges.\n\nTo this end, a chieftain of APC, Okosisi Ngwu, has dragged the Buni-led caretaker committee before a High Court in Abuja seeking a nullification of the congresses. The plaintiff is also asking the court to declare the congresses held under Buni as illegal, flowing from the Supreme Court judgement that questioned the validity of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee.\n\nThe suit marked FCT/HC/CV/1824/2021 and dated August 2, 2021, listed the APC and all members of the caretaker committee as defendants.\n\nThey are Buni, Isiaka Oyebola, Ken Nnamani, Stella Okorete, Governor Sani Bello, Dr James Lalu, Senator Abubakar Yusuf, Hon. Akenyemi Olaide, David Leon, Abba Ali, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Ismail Ahmed, and Senator James Akpanudoedehe.\n\nIn the originating summons filed by his counsel, Chief Oba Maduabuchi (SAN), Ngwu is further asking the court to dissolve the committee, as there was no organ of the party or any such organisation in the party\u2019s constitution as Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nHe equally sought a declaration that pursuant to Section 87(4)(b)(1) of the Electoral Act (as amended), only the National Executive Committee of a political party could validly appoint a date for the holding of primaries for the nomination of the governorship or other candidates of the political party.\n\nNgwu, who hinted that he had wanted to contest the position of the National Chairman of the party in 2018, urged the court to grant an order setting aside all actions and decisions taken by members of CECPC of the party.\n\nAPC is, apparently, yet to agree on a strategy to approach the quagmire it has found itself in. But what the majority of members feel the party can minimise its losses by, first, cancelling the congresses and, then, fathoming a way out of the legal ditch it has found itself.\n\nIn PDP, the last few months have been palpably discomforting, with the party losing about three governors and several state and federal lawmakers to different reasons, including not being able to tag along anymore with the PDP leadership.\n\nLeading the defection train was the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, followed by Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade, and, most recently, Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle, whose defection had also raised some constitutional concerns following the manner of his emergence as governor.\n\nMatawalle had emerged governor after the 2019 general election, sequel to a Supreme Court judgement that disqualified all APC candidates across the board over allegedly flawed primary elections. Although PDP is still in court challenging Matawalle\u2019s defection and asking the Supreme Court to sack him, a fresh crisis has erupted in the party, with the National Youth Leader, Sunday Udey-Okoye, berating the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus.\n\nThis was soon taken a notch up as seven officials of the party tendered their letters of resignation yesterday over allegations of marginalisation by the party leadership.\n\nBut Secondus has described what the youth leader said as the price of leadership, wondering why he did not realise that the deputies that resigned were not given any official duties in the last three years or since the inception of the party.\n\nOther members of the NWC, it was gathered, equally berated the national youth leader, alleging that he is being economical with the truth. One of the NWC members, who spoke to THISDAY on condition of anonymity, stated, \u201cAsk the deputies that resigned, they knew before they contested elections to become officials of the party; knew that they are not entitled to attend the NWC meeting, less invited.\n\n\u201cIf they were not sponsored, why are they just waking up from their slumber? This is a constitutional issue. There is nothing we could do unless the constitution of the party is amended.\n\n\u201cThis has been the case right from the formation of the party. They are being used.\u201d\n\nThe NWC member said, a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting would soon be summoned to address the issues raised.\n\nSecondus, in his response, claimed that the issue was not personal but the price of leadership. He alleged that the seven deputies that resigned were sponsored, as they were all aware of their status before being elected.\n\n\u201cThe National Working Committee of our great party at its meeting today received the notice of the resignation from deputies, who are elected members of the National Executive Committee,\u201d Secondus confirmed.\n\nResponding to the emergency, National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said, \u201cThe meeting of the National Working Committee and the deputies immediately took place to dialogue on the issues that were raised. The party will look into the grievances raised by members of NEC as well as members of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cThe internal conflict resolution mechanism of our party has also been immediately activated to put these issues behind us. We call on all the leaders, stakeholder and members of our great party to remain calm as we collectively resolve these issues.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview with newsmen, the youth leader blamed Secondus for the problems of the party.\n\nThe youth leader stated, \u201cMr. Uche Secondus, the national chairman of the party, is incompetent of managing the affairs of this party, he lacks managerial capacity to manage PDP. He had made sure that many departments of the party did not function as effectively as it ought to function. Mr. Chairman has nothing to offer to the party; only to come here and deceive us.\n\n\u201cThere is a sharp division in our NWC right now, not only me, many more NWC members are more aggrieved than myself.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, National Organising Secretary of the PDP, Col. Austin Akobundu, confirmed the resignation of seven members of the NWC.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that by the PDP constitution, the seven different deputies that resigned were not truly eligible to attend meetings of the NWC. It is the substantive officers that attend the NWC, except where in the absence of the substantive official.\n\nBut the deputies have been agitating that they should be allowed to attend the main NWC meeting as the information reaching them after NWC was always secondary. The seven national officers of PDP, in their separate letters, addressed to National Secretary of the party, Senator Unaru Tsauri, on Tuesday, alleged being side-lined and unfairly treated by the National Chairman, Secondus.\n\nThose who have resigned are Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Deputy Woman Leader, and Deputy National Auditor.\n\nOne of the deputies that resigned, who pleaded anonymity, also berated the Secondus-led NWC for allegedly treating deputy national officers \u201cas if we are nobodies.\u201d\n\nAsked to clarify the statement, the officer said, \u201cSince our election in 2017, we (deputy national officers) have only met with our chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, thrice. It is not as if he called us; on those three occasions, we sought audience with him.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying part is that during Christmas and Sallah festivities, the NWC would visit our governors. They would collect money and other items but I can tell you that they don\u2019t share anything with the deputies. To him, we are just a necessary evil to be tolerated but never to be catered for.\n\n\u201cWe all have our constituencies and our followers but from the way we are being treated, it appears they see us as nothing but appendages forced on them by the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAs at press time, the Secondus-led NWC was meeting and a statement expected from the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum said it received with regrets and sadness the recent rumblings in the party. It called on all members of the party and stakeholders to remain calm in the face of the developments.\n\nThe PDP governors, in a statement by their chairman, Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, said, \u201cWe plead with all aggrieved persons and those with the interest of the PDP at heart to keep their gun powder dry, as efforts are being made in consultation with members of the PDP Board of Trustees and other stakeholders to resolve all contending issues.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum has scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss the affairs of the party and the way forward. The PDP, as the only remaining hope of the nation for good governance, must show an example to Nigerians and also take advantage of the current disarray in the APC and its rudderless government.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Gbajabiamila extols CBN governor\u2019s diligence\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu: He is an invaluable asset to Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari today congratulated the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, and wished him well on his 60th birthday. Buhari appreciated the economist and banker for his patriotic service to the country at a time of difficult economic challenges.\n\nThe president prayed that Emefiele\u2019s efforts would yield positive dividends for the generality of Nigerians to reap from.\n\nBuhari equally wished the CBN governor good health and greater service to fatherland.\n\nIn a congratulatory letter to Emefiele, which was personally signed by the president, he stated, \u201cIt gives me great pleasure to rejoice with you on the occasion of your diamond jubilee. Kindly accept the felicitations of myself, family and Nigerians at this auspicious milestone.\n\n\u201cAs Governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, you have rendered selfless service to your country at a most challenging period of our economic development, and I salute your commitment, passion and doggedness. As you continue to build on these achievements, it is my hope that your efforts translate to more positive results on the nation\u2019s economy for improved living standards we envisage for our people.\n\n\u201cWhile using this medium to pray Almighty God to bless you with many more years in good health and service to your fatherland, please accept my best wishes and personal regards.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, also congratulated Emefiele and praised his diligence and commitment to the country\u2019s economic project. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, Gbajabiamila said Emefiele was one Nigerian whose track record of excellence was there for all to see.\n\nThe statement quoted the speaker as saying regarding Emefiele, \u201cNigeria and Nigerians are proud of him for his services.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, felicitated Emefiele, describing him as an invaluable asset to Nigeria.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, noted that the CBN governor\u2019s input to the country\u2019s economy and the financial sector were clear testament to his visionary leadership.\n\nThe governor said the renowned economist and banker had used his wealth of experience for the benefit of the private sector, especially the banking industry, at a most challenging period of the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOn behalf of my adorable wife, Ibijoke, and the good people of Lagos State, I heartily congratulate the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on the occasion of his Diamond Jubilee.\u201d\n\nThe governor said attaining the age of 60 year in grace was worth celebrating, considering Emefiele\u2019s remarkable track record in the financial world. He said the CBN governor\u2019s performance had earned him an enviable place as Governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank.\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, over the years, Emefiele has proved his worth as a good manager of human and capital resources in both the private and public sectors.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cAs CBN Governor, Emefiele has been a worthy partner in our administration\u2019s quest to build a Greater Lagos for millions of Lagosians, by creatively working with us in some areas of intervention aimed at building institutions for sustainable economic growth and development of Lagos State.\n\n\u201cMr. Emefiele\u2019s intellectual input to the nation\u2019s economy in this globally economic depressing period has helped in no small measure to stabilise the business environment, while restoring confidence in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAs Mr. Godwin Emefiele celebrates his Diamond Jubilee, I wish him good health and more fruitful years. I pray that God will continue to preserve and grant him good health to enable him render more service to humanity and our dear nation.\u201d\n\nEmefiele has been at the forefront of Nigeria\u2019s economic diversification drive, by providing the critical financial support to operators in the non-oil sector. Under him, the CBN has rolled out massive development interventions in critical sectors of the economy, especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThe interventions Emefiele include the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS); Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF); Agri-business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS); Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI); Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF); the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP); and the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), among several other development finance initiatives in the past seven years.\n\nUnder the MSMEDF, which charges nine per cent interest rate, the disbursement of over N83.9billion to 216,704 beneficiaries was recorded at the end of 2020. AGSMEIS is an initiative of the Bankers\u2019 Committee, in collaboration with the CBN, that was also set up to improve access to affordable and sustainable finance by agri-businesses and MSMEs.\n\nThe initiatives have enhanced job creation and boosted the managerial capacity of agri-businesses and MSMEs.\n\nSo far, a total of N111.7 billion has been disbursed to 29,026 beneficiaries. Furthermore, a N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility was introduced in March 2020 as a stimulus package to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on households and MSMEs across the country. The fund has been increased N400 billion.\n\nIn terms of the ABP, over 3.1 million farmers have been financed for the cultivation of crops across 21 agricultural commodities. Also, a total of 3,107,890 farmers have been financed for the cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodities through 23 Participating Financial Institutions in the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from the inception of the programme till date.\n\nFor the YEDP, which was launched in 2016 to enhance the deployment of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of Nigerian youths to achieve maximum economic development, a total of N173.4 million has been disbursed to over 67 beneficiaries. The target beneficiaries are members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), non-NYSC (but not more than five years post-NYSC), holders of verifiable tertiary institution certificates, and artisans with First School Leaving Certificate or a technical certificate or accredited proficiency certificate from the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\nEmefiele also earned his stripes as one of the heroes of the country\u2019s efforts to contain COVID-19. The CBN under Emefiele\u2019s leadership was proactive in mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the economy.\n\nImmediately the first COVID-19 case was recorded in Lagos, the Emefiele-led CBN took decisive actions and unfolded a raft of measures to moderate the effect of the virus on households, businesses, and the economy.\n\nEmefiele was also instrumental to the formation of the private-sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), which was able to mobilise billions of naira and has immensely supported the country\u2019s COVID-19 fight by setting up healthcare facilities across the country and distributing palliatives to states. It also established a health sector grant to promote research in the development of vaccines, among other policy measures.\n\nThe health sector facility has provided loans to pharmaceutical companies to expand and open drug-manufacturing plants in the country, and it has helped hospitals and healthcare practitioners to expand and build health facilities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A report on how former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, was the subject of a probe 11 years ago by the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs chaired by Senator Carl Levin has been obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nThe report detailed how Atiku as Vice President of Nigeria used offshore companies to siphon millions of dollars between 2000 and 2008 to his fourth wife in the United States, Jennifer Iwenjiora Douglas Abubakar.\n\nJennifer, originally an indigene of Onitsha, Anambra State, and a Nigerian Television Authority News correspondent in the 1980s later moved to and became a citizen of the United States.\n\nAccording to the report submitted to the US Senate by the committee on February 10, 2010, the illegally transferred money made Atiku an \u201cemployer of labor\u201d and a proud owner of American University of Nigeria (AUN), a school, whose tuition fees more than 99% of Nigerian students cannot afford.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain established AUN at a time when public universities were collapsing under him and Obasanjo and poor Nigerian students were languishing at home due to strike action by lectures over poor funding.\n\nFormer President George Bush had in 2004 barred Atiku and other corrupt politically exposed persons from being issued visas to the US.\n\nDocuments Expose How Ex-Vice President, Atiku Used Wife To Launder $40million To US For Eight Years by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThe US Senate probe indicting the former Nigerian Vice President was motivated by US government concern about corruption in the Third World and its corrosive effects on the development of honest government, democratic principles, and the rule of law.\n\nThe report partly reads, \u201cFrom 2000 to 2008, Jennifer Douglas, a U.S. citizen and the fourth wife of Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President and former candidate for President of Nigeria, helped her husband bring over $40 million in suspect funds into the United States through wire transfers sent by offshore corporations to U.S. bank accounts.\n\n\u201cIn a 2008 civil complaint, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ms. Douglas received over $2 million in bribe payments in 2001 and 2002, from Siemens AG, a major German corporation.\n\n\u201cWhile Ms. Douglas denies wrongdoing, Siemens has already pleaded guilty to U.S. criminal charges and settled civil charges related to bribery and told the Subcommittee that it sent the payments to one of her U.S. accounts.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, Mr. Atiku was the subject of corruption allegations in Nigeria related to the Petroleum Technology Development Fund. Of the $40 million in suspect funds, $25 million was wire transferred by offshore corporations into more than 30 U.S. bank accounts opened by Ms. Douglas, primarily by Guernsey Trust Company Nigeria Ltd., LetsGo Ltd. Inc., and Sima Holding Ltd.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. banks maintaining those accounts were, at times, unaware of her PEP status, and they allowed multiple, large offshore wire transfers into her accounts. As each bank began to question the offshore wire transfers, Ms. Douglas indicated that all of the funds came from her husband and professed little familiarity with the offshore corporations actually sending her money.\n\n\u201cWhen one bank closed her account due to the offshore wire transfers, her lawyer helped convince other banks to provide a new account. In addition, two of the offshore corporations wire transferred about $14 million over five years to American University in Washington, D.C., to pay for consulting services related to the development of a Nigerian university founded by Mr. Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cAmerican University accepted the wire transfers without asking about the identity of the offshore corporations or the source of their funds, because under current law, the University had no legal obligation to inquire.\n\n\u201cCombating corruption is a key U.S. value and goal, due to its corrosive effects on the rule of law, economic development, and democratic principles. In 2001, the Patriot Act made the acceptance of foreign corruption proceeds a U.S. money laundering offense for the first time, and required banks to apply enhanced scrutiny to private banking accounts opened for senior foreign political figures, their relatives, and close associates.\n\n\u201cIn 2003, the United States supported the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, now ratified by over 140 countries. Also in 2003, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) formed an investigative group dedicated to combating foreign corruption by PEPs.\n\n\u201cIn 2004, President Bush issued Presidential Proclamation 7750 denying U.S. visas to foreign officials involved with corruption, and Congress later enacted supporting legislation. A 2009 study sponsored by the World Bank analyzed PEP controls worldwide and recommended stronger measures to reduce corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (Subcommittee) initiated this investigation to learn how U.S. laws apply to PEPs utilizing the domestic financial system, and examine how foreign senior political figures, their relatives, and close associates may be circumventing or undermining anti-money laundering (AML) and PEP controls to bring funds that may be the product of foreign corruption into the United States. It is the latest in a series of Subcommittee hearings examining foreign corruption and its U.S. aiders and abettors.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of its investigation, the Subcommittee staff conducted over 100 interviews, including interviews of lawyers, real estate agents, escrow agents, lobbyists, bankers, university professionals, and government officials.\n\n\u201cThe Subcommittee issued over 50 subpoenas and reviewed millions of pages of documents, including bank records, correspondence, contracts, emails, property records, flight records, news articles, and court pleadings. In addition, the Subcommittee consulted with foreign officials, international organizations, financial regulators, and experts in anti-money laundering and anti-corruption efforts.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that a former US congressman, William Jefferson was in 2010 sentenced to 13 years in jail for corruption that involved US companies and Nigerian officials.\n\nThe ruling by Federal Judge, TS Ellis III of the US District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, followed Jefferson's conviction for collecting bribes on behalf of Nigerian officials, specifically, Atiku.\n\nHowever, the FBI found $90,000 cash, which Jefferson said was meant for the PDP chieftain, hidden in a freezer.\n\nBut Atiku and his wife, Jennifer did not accept summons and subpoenas to appear before the US court.\n\nInstead, they moved their family out to Dubai, and put their potomac mansion up for sale.",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns.

The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million.

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "text": "Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda Bank, has raised $55 million in a Series B round at a valuation of $500 million. This comes after a recent Series A of $25 million announced by the company just a little over four months ago.\n\nThe latest round was co-led by existing investors Target Global and Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded and backed by PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel. SBI Investment and other previous angels also participated.\n\nKuda plans to use the funds to build on its new services for Nigeria as well as prepare for a continental expansion. According to Co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda aims to build a new take on banking services for \u201cevery African on the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of resource deployment in our operational entity, in Nigeria. But now we are doubling down on expansion and the idea is to build a strong team for the expansion plans for Kuda,\u201d Ogundeyi told TechCrunch, without disclosing which countries Kuda is eyeing.\n\n\u201cFor Babs and Musty, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,\u201d said Ricardo Sch\u00e4fer, the partner at Target Global. \u201cThe prospect of banking over 1 billion people from day one really stood out for me at the beginning.\u201d\n\nOgundeyi co-founded Kuda with the now CTO, Musty Mustapha, in the second half of 2019. The startup launched in Nigeria as a no-fees, digital-only bank with $1.6 million pre-seed funding. It has since witnessed significant growth.\n\nAs of November 2020, Kuda had 300,000 customers and was processing an average of $500 million worth of transactions per month.\n\nBy March this year, Kuda\u2019s registered users had more than doubled to 650,000, after the startup processed $2.2 billion a month earlier. Presently, Kuda has 1.4 million people in its user base.\n\nBeyond just basic financial services, Kuda now offers credit to its users by way of an overdraft allowance, which the company pre-qualifies the most active users for.\n\nIn the second quarter of the year, Kuda disbursed $20 million worth of credit to over 200,000 qualified users, with a 30-day repayment period.\n\nAccording to Ogundeyi, Kuda has seen \u201cminimal\u201d default because of its approach. \u201cWe use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer\u2019s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,\u201d he said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cKuda is our first investment in Africa and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months,\u201d said Andrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures.\n\n\u201cWith a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda\u2019s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we\u2019re proud to continue supporting them.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much does it cost to educate a girl child? This is one of the questions that come to mind when trying to make sense of why there are more out-of-school girls than there are in school globally.\n\nConfirmed in findings by the United Nations, it is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa, where many people expect girl children to sacrifice their education to get married early.\n\nWith such expectations, girls are almost always deprived of opportunities for higher education, much less a career. However, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) says the situation is getting better, although the pace is slow.\n\nBut for a father willing to go against the norm in the 1990s, Nigerian-founded Patricia Technologies would not have the amazing brand manager it currently has.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the three years and six months since Rachael Akalia joined Patricia Technologies, she has taken on seven roles at the company, something she considers challenging but worth it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to a point where I\u2019ve realised what I love, that I want to grow where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m someone that always wants to fix a problem and being a brand manager helps me do that. But I don\u2019t fix the problem when it\u2019s a problem, I prevent it from becoming a problem. It\u2019s more of being proactive,\u201d Rachael revealed during a recent conversation at Patricia Technologies\u2019 HQ in Lekki, Lagos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael Akalia\n\nLiving across the river, aiming for the skies\n\nOne of nine children from Anambra State, Nigeria, Rachael spent her primary and secondary school years in Ikom, Cross River State with her mom and late dad. Before heading for the university, she spent her post-secondary school years with her older brother in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.\n\nBut, she almost missed out on a tertiary education.\n\nBeing the eighth child at a time when younger siblings were not permitted to be ahead of their older ones in school \u2014 and in some cases, marriage \u2014 Rachael had to wait two years before going to the university. And it didn\u2019t come easy.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, I told them, \u2018just register me for the exam, I promise, I won\u2019t pass it.\u2019 But I knew I was tricking them because there was no way I would not pass it. While I was home, I was studying and solving JAMB past questions. I also did a six-month training in basic computer knowledge and got a certificate.\u201d\n\nShe faced another hurdle when she got admitted to study economics at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, and her older sister, who took the same exams, didn\u2019t. The family decided that Rachael would go to school five months after school resumed.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t slow her down; she caught up on five months of work. Such was her resolve that she set a first-class honours target for herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the while, she had a nudge.\n\n\u201cI had this quote, \u2018Aim for the moon, and if you miss it, you land among the stars.\u2019 So, in my head, if I missed First Class, I\u2019d get a Second Class Upper. But I wasn\u2019t going home with anything less than that because I needed to show them that the investment was worth it.\u201d\n\nSeizing opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael knew that an education would open doors for her. And it did.\n\nThe entrepreneur in her was awakened when she took on the responsibility for some of her financial needs during her four years at the university.\n\n\u201cFor other dues, apart from my school fees which my brother took up, I taught tutorial classes. In my department, they knew me as the \u2018Summary girl.\u2019 I would summarise big textbooks into five pages without missing out on any important details. This was all thanks to my English teacher in secondary school whose summary and comprehension lessons came in handy.\u201d\n\nWith time, she became the go-to person for detailed study and exam prep materials. Rachael, who says her handwriting is hard to miss, kept this up for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t her only shot at entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring her mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) year at a secondary school in Enugu State, where she taught accounting, commerce, and economics, she sold pastries and organised classes for the students. Realising that most students didn\u2019t understand why they were in school, she says she focused on making an impact, not on money.\n\n\u201cThey had this mentality that they didn\u2019t need to study. They were actually forced to go to school. The boys wanted to farm, and the girls wanted to get married. But I had to tell them that inasmuch as you want to do all those things, it is really important to get vital knowledge first. I encouraged them with my story, and it was a reorientation for them.\u201d\n\nSimilar stories of motivation do not always achieve desired results, but her efforts were not futile. The school recorded its first year of excellent West African Examination Council (WAEC) results in the subjects she taught, ending five years of abysmal results. This remains one of the high points of her life.\n\nMoving up at Patricia Technologies\n\nAfter her NYSC, Rachael got an unsatisfactory sales and marketing job in Port Harcourt. In her quest for a new challenge, she moved to Lagos after being invited for an interview following numerous applications.\n\n\u201cI was writing nothing less than 25 applications daily. I was following job sites, and whether I was qualified or not, I applied immediately I got a job notification. And I did this on my phone because I didn\u2019t have a laptop.\u201d\n\nWith seven interview invites in her inbox, she made her way to Lagos. She got three offers, the first of which she took. Rachael eventually discovered that the marketing job came with a lot of pressure and unrealistic targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, she had turned down an offer from Patricia Technologies in February 2018 because the startup was only a few months old, and she didn\u2019t understand its operations.\n\nJust when she decided to begin her search for a new job, Patricia reached out, asking why she turned down the offer. Hiding her excitement after a contract review, she accepted a role in the operations team and resumed on February 5, 2018.\n\n\u201cI knew that I would be excellent wherever I worked, but the only factor that might hold me back was a lack of experience. I just wanted to get experience. So, I was willing to take any role to start, figure out what I wanted to do, and start getting skills in that area. I believed that I would figure out a career path to follow within one year.\u201d\n\nAfter a few months in the operations team, she moved to the gifts department. That was where CEO, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, discovered she had skills in complaint resolution, customer handling, and digital marketing. She was better suited for relationship-based tasks with such a skillset, so Agbodje asked her to become the startup\u2019s customer service representative and social media manager.\n\nShortly after, the media department was created to handle graphics designing, content creation, and digital marketing. And after 11 months at the startup, Rachael became the head of the media team, but she knew there were more responsibilities ahead; Agbodje thought so too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this thing my boss does at the beginning of the year; he weighs people\u2019s strengths and puts them in positions where they can magnify these strengths and better work on their skills. He said, \u2018Rachael, I have watched you for a while, and I think you have great customer service skills. I want to start a proper customer service team, which you will head.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeading a team of ten was a new challenge that came with greater responsibility which prompted her to take customer service courses on Udemy. She also read widely and followed successful companies. And this is her modus operandi for every new role she finds herself occupying.\n\nBy June 2019, the growth of the Patricia team necessitated the expansion of the customer service team to 35 people. Rachael promptly stepped into the role of supervisor, and a professional customer service lead came in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a reshuffle in January 2020, Rachael chose to be on the marketing team.\n\nFor Rachael, a recurrent theme with these changes in roles was how well they aligned with her life goals and how she often leaves a role more knowledgeable than she came in. But the management saw beyond that.\n\n\u201cI had a conversation with Chika, the Chief People Officer, about why I was moved to the marketing team. She said I was a growth facilitator and that I build whatever team I\u2019m in. And they needed to build the marketing team.\u201d\n\nRachael had a month to put creatives in the startup together under a team in preparation for a head of marketing who would soon come in. As a marketing executive, she worked directly with Ogunwede Rotimi, who she reveals also played an integral role in her growth.\n\nThis path led her to become the brand manager in June 2020.\n\n\u201cAnd this was more challenging because I have to embody the brand. I have to know what is good for the brand whenever I speak for the brand. I have to be the brand and make decisions that will affect the brand. So, I can\u2019t falter.\u201d\n\nRachael acknowledges how important bringing in experienced hires is in a business, and holding her current role for over a year, she has exceeded her growth expectations. She attributes this to being in an environment that facilitates growth.\n\nLife hacks and aspirations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael believes building habits takes consistency, and she constantly makes an effort to replace unhealthy habits with good ones. One way she does this is by setting alarms due to the management and organisational skills she picked up at a young age.\n\n\u201cI get to remind myself to do things. I have a reminder that tells me to sleep, drink water, call my friends, see a movie, call my mom, pay my tithe, take a stroll, and every other thing.\u201d\n\nA typical workday sees her responding to internal and external emails, setting up tasks to achieve weekly goals, liaising with other team leads to carry out their tasks, and having meetings. Essentially, she works with every team in the company depending on the startup\u2019s needs per time.\n\nOutside work, Rachael likes reading \u2014 or doing anything that increases her knowledge \u2014 travelling, eating, and writing.\n\nWhile she continues to embody the Patricia brand, Rachael ultimately plans to go back to school, something she has put on hold for a few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom interpersonal communication to business transactions, technology is fast changing the conventional way of doing most things. And Africa has not been left out in the wave of groundbreaking innovations.\n\nMany young Africans are joining in the development of novel tech infrastructure and building products that cut across various fields.\n\nNonetheless, Africa\u2019s young population \u2014 aged 15 to 24 \u2014 make up more than 200 million of her over 1 billion populace. These youth account for a large chunk of the unemployed. Interestingly, of the 20 countries with the youngest population in the world, 19 are African.\n\nCombine this with the continent\u2019s worryingly low number of upskilled developers and a limited tech talent pool, and you have a situation that can hinder Africa\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDissatisfied with this situation, Dauda Barry, a London-based Senegalese serial entrepreneur, was propelled to start Alida School in March 2021, an online coding school for Africans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlida School\u2019s Co-founder and CEO, Dauda Barry\n\nAfter getting a degree in computer science from the Queen Mary University of London, he founded Adama Robotics in 2016, an AI company that builds and sells educational robotic kits.\n\n\u201cBuilding up Adama Robotics, being part of the startup ecosystem in London, I began hearing about Lambda School. I liked the model; the fact that it shifts the risk from the students to the organisation. Then I thought, \u2018why not build a Lambda for Africa?\u2019\n\nFor context, Lambda is a US-based online coding school that offers a six-month training course with tuition deducted as a certain percentage from students\u2019 income when they land their first jobs.\n\nReports reveal that 60% of Africa\u2019s unemployed population are youth, a statistic that Mthuli Ncube, former Chief Economist at the African Development Bank (AfDB), describes as \u201c\u2026unacceptable for a continent with such an impressive pool of youth, talent and creativity.\u201d\n\nAnd Barry shares this view.\n\n\u201cYou know, we have the young, the growing, and the innovative in the continent; mobile Internet penetration is rising, while its cost is falling a bit. There are many tech startups in Africa, yet we produce fewer computer scientists and developers than the rest of the world. So I thought, \u2018how can we bridge this gap?\u2019\u201d\n\nA Statista report states that as of 2019, only 7.7% of households in Africa were estimated to have a computer at home. As Barry thought about building a Lambda for Africa, he wondered how students in the African market would access stable Internet and computers for classes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis question was answered when he paid a visit to Senegal in February 2021.\n\n\u201cI was in Dakar, and I noticed my cousin who was running a degree in computer science taking most of his classes remotely. Then later, he took me to the community centre, where they had computers and Internet for people to use. Then I thought, \u2018Oh! A Lambda School for Africa can work in Senegal.'\u201d\n\nRealising the feasibility, Barry began building Alida School upon his return to London in March 2021.\n\nThe initial plan was to teach young Senegalese how to code. However, upon announcing application openings for the first cohort on Twitter, things took a surprising turn.\n\n\u201cWe started to receive applications from Kenya, Nigeria, and Guinea Bissau. In fact, our current students in this first cohort are mainly from Kenya and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSo, the focus moved from Senegal to the rest of Africa.\n\nAnd by \u2018we\u2019, he\u2019s referring to himself and his co-founder. While searching for good tutors, he met his co-founder, George Chinedu Ikwegbu, a computer engineering graduate of Michael Okpara University, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Chinedu Ikwegbu\n\n\u201cThere I was on Twitter, reading through and learning from insightful threads as usual, when Dauda sent me a DM, introducing me to his plans for Alida School and asking if it was something I\u2019d like to join,\u201d Ikwegbu recounts.\n\nIkwegbu, who has a flair for teaching, didn\u2019t hesitate to jump on the offer.\n\n\u201cI have always loved teaching, and so I told him yes. We then talked about my proficiency in programming languages. After a series of tests and virtual coffee conversations, I became a partner and coding tutor at Alida School.\u201d\n\nA sustainable model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, Alida School is cohort-based, with each cohort running for 12 weeks. Alida School provides schooling in mainly front-end web development, Git, and Vue.js, and the first cohort is currently eleven weeks into the programme. Classes are held virtually, from 7-9 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nBefore students are enrolled, they are interviewed. Barry believes this helps to filter out those who might not be committed to the course.\n\n\u201cOnline course completion is at 52-53% rate in the world today, and so George and I monitor the attendance and check for accountability tightly. During the interview, we make it clear that attendance is at least 90%,\u201d Barry says.\n\nTuition is paid via a hybrid model. Students make a part payment upfront, and then the rest is paid using an income share agreement (ISA) when they land their first jobs.\n\n\u201cSome of the students prefer paying the tuition upfront because to them, it helps with consistency. Knowing that they have paid for the classes, they can\u2019t afford to miss any,\u201d Barry adds.\n\nThe hybrid payment model is similar to that of Decagon Institute, a Lagos-based coding school that offers a six-month training for software engineers, using upfront payment or the ISA method.\n\nWhile the current fee of $180 is seemingly steep, Barry says it was reached after a lot of deliberation.\n\n\u201cCompared to our competitors in the West, who charge as much as $9,000, ours is somewhat fair. I\u2019m a big advocate of a business being sustainable. Initially, we wanted to charge higher, but we went and asked for feedback from Senegalese people, based on their monthly and average salaries, and $180 was the highest we could go.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, Alida School\u2019s primary means of revenue is from its paying customers, and Barry discloses that there are plans to apply for funding.\n\n\u201cEventually, we\u2019ll apply for funding, but for now, we\u2019re dependent on tuition. We\u2019re still a small team, and I think small teams are good. We\u2019ll be faster, and with time, extend our runway.\u201d\n\nChallenges so far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIkwegbu says that a major challenge so far has been poor Internet connectivity.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I\u2019m taking a class, and suddenly the network cuts and students can\u2019t follow any more until after a while. This greatly affects us,\u201d he says.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Barry reveals that plans are underway for the school to partner with telcos and get subsidised data bundles for students.\n\n\u201cWe have maybe 60 to 70% of good Internet. So far, I\u2019ll rate it 8 or 9 out of 10, which actually is not great, but it could be worse. Hopefully, things improve with time. The plan is to partner with telcos to get a stable source of data for our students at subsidised rates.\u201d\n\nAlso, Barry shares that the startup has challenges with payments and transactions made to countries outside Africa. There are usually many glitches when students are trying to pay their fees.\n\n\u201cAs much as a lot of fintechs in Africa are really putting in the work, there\u2019s still a lot that can be done with getting funds across to bank accounts outside the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does the future hold for Alida School?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort term plans include adding more courses to the school\u2019s curriculum and expansion into more African countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently recruiting tutors for back-end so that we can raise more full-stack developers. For the next cohort, new courses will be integrated into the platform like back-end, app development (iOS and Android) and Data Science,\u201d says Barry\n\nAlso adding that the big picture is to reduce the unemployment and poverty gap while raising the next generation of tech talent in Africa, Barry says, \u201cThere is a big need to raise local talents in Africa. A lot of companies are outsourcing their talent needs to European developers to carry out projects.\u201d\n\nAnother goal for the second cohort is a remote and physical expansion to cities in other African countries.\n\n\u201cOur long term plans include foraying into major tech growing cities in Ghana, South Africa, and Rwanda, and also establishing a physical school in Africa, where we can teach people in person,\u201d Barry reveals.\n\nAnd because the school currently runs an English speaking teaching method, most Senegalese students usually do not want to enrol.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried that they won\u2019t be able to follow through because of their English, so we\u2019re looking to employ someone who can teach coding in French, so we can get more applications from Francophone African countries,\u201d Barry shares.\n\nWith the various challenges that Africa\u2019s burgeoning tech scene faces, startups like Alida School will go a long way in creating and refining talents to bolster the growth of technological innovations on the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

The scheme is borne out of our desire to fast-track development of infrastructure across the state, as the government can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI want to encourage companies, shareholders and individuals who have business interests in Edo State, or companies making money through production, that the government is ready to further partner with them in the area of giving them tax credit, which will be utilised to expand Infrastructure in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki urged those already collecting tax credits from Federal Government but operating in the state to apply such tax credits to some of the communities where they do their businesses, adding, \u201cthis country is going to grow on the back of the investment being made by the private sector and their tax contributions will finance both state and federal governments in the years ahead\u201d.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cThe Federal Government is doing the same as some major companies are benefiting and some of them have operations in Edo, but using it in other states. We encourage them to utilize the tax credit in the area they are making money rather than taking it somewhere else.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage more Investors to invest in Edo State as the government has put all measures on ground to protect investors coming into the state, as we would not allow those that want to discourage investors in the state.\n\n\u201cToday is historic because the state is doing something that has not been done before except by the federal government. We have realized that looking into the future, the sources of financing government activities will come mostly from the private sector.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chief Executive Officer of Saro Group of Companies, Mr. Rasheed Sarumi, hailed the governor for the tax credit.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nFactional chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Hon. Clement Olasoji Adagunodo, has described a purported query that was allegedly issued by the State Secretary of the party, Prince Bola Ajao, under the instructions of an individual he identified as a factional party chairman of supporters of Senator Ademola Adeleke for Governor group known as The Pathfinder Team, as illegal, null and void and of no effect.\n\nAdagunodo who spoke in a statement on Wednesday in Osogbo, said what Prince Bola Ajao did amounted to flagrant violation of the constitution of the party because, according him, the constitution of PDP is clear enough that a factional chairman has no power or authority to direct the State Secretary to carry out such a function or to call a selective executive meeting.\n\nAccording to Hon. Adagunodo, \u201cthe composition of the State Executives of the party in Section 24 (1) (a) \u2013 (x) states clearly those who must be on seat before the party can issue queries to members of the State Executives Committee in case there is an infraction.\u201d\n\nAdagunodo added that \u201ca factional Chairman of a pressure group like Sunday Bisi, the legally recognized Publicity Secretary of the party has no constitutional power/authority to delegate power, assign or give the State Secretary any instruction to act the way he did.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the queried officers are not bothered about the illegality going on in Osun PDP under the factional Chairman, Hon. Sunday Bisi and they will take appropriate action if necessary on the purported query issued to them, however, they largely rely on the pronouncements of the Court, because:\n\n1. They have been reporting to PDP Secretariat, located at the King\u2019s Square, Opposite BIKET Hospital Junction, Ikirun Road at regular intervals and holding meetings as occasion demands more so that they have not been invited to their actional meetings for obvious reasons.\n\n2. As far as law is concerned, Adagunodo remains the Chairman because the ruling of Ikirun High Court of November 9th, 2020 has neither been vacated, nor appealed.\n\n3. Even Court of Appeal Akure, for the fact that it refused to uphold Ground 6 of the Appellant, did not remove Adagunodo as Chairman. (See the case of Mafimisebi Vs Obaruntan)\n\n4. No Court in the land has ever made specific order or judgment that the usurper is the Chairman of PDP in Osun State or that he should return to office as Acting Chairman after his removal of 3rd November, 2020 and the validation of same on 9th November, 2020 in a preservative order granted Adagunodo to continue in office pending the final determination of the substantive case. They should not add what is not contained in the Court of Appeal Judgment into it.\n\n5. For the fact that the purported removal from office by NWC has never been approved by NEC of the party, Hon. Soji Adagunodo remains the chairman, whom they reported to in compliance with Section 59 (3) (a) to (x) of the Constitution of the Party.). The NEC has held at least three or four meetings after the purported suspension and the issue or ratification of same was never tabled or discussed.\n\n7. Even the usurper\u2019s unlawful appointment by the National Working Committee was set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction on the 9th of November, 2020 which decision restored me back to office as the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Osun State Chapter which is still very valid, subsisting and binding on all parties as same is yet to be appealed against or set aside by an appellate court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n8. In what capacity can a fellow Exco member query another fellow Exco member? None.\n\n9. It is the person that issued the Query that should be sanctioned for factionalising the Party and for holding purported Selective State Exco Meeting in a private residence and building. (See the case of Inakoju & ors Vs Adeleke\u2026 ) (Governor Rasheed Ladoja\u2019s case).\n\n10. It is interesting and rather unfortunate that, the usurper who precipitated the first crisis, without waiting for it to be resolved or making any move whatsoever in resolving the crisis in Osun PDP have now scaled up their desire to destroy the party, by stirring the hornest net. This is not an issue of the opposition party to blame, as the usurper are trying to deceive the unwavering, rather it is a self inflicted injury, born out of inordinate ambition and financial gains. It is not going to work. They have, for the second time, thrown their hat into the rings; we are very ready to accept the challenge. It is a matter of \u2018iron will bend iron.\u2019\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cThe party will not cede her control and authority to power Merchants who are wining and dining with the opposition Government at the Federal level and in some states yet pretending to be sympathetic to the course of PDP in Osun State. The party will confront the gamers and enhance our electoral values and ultimate victory in 2022 by the Grace of God.\n\n\u201cGoing by the above analysis, Hon. Adagunodo said the purported query of our seven officers is in total violation of the provisions of the constitution of the party which vested the power to query erring officers or members of the state Executives on the State Executive Committee of the party as entrenched in the constitution not a selective one as done by the factional executives loyal Senator Nurudeen Ademola Adeleke and the query should be discarded, disregarded and treated as null and void and of no effect.\u201d",

          "text": "By TIM AYUBA\n\nIn a bid to safeguard its e-banking platforms with enhanced safety and security features, Unity Bank Plc has unveiled a new code on its USSD platform that completely puts the customer in control of his Bank Account against any e-Banking fraud.\n\nThe new code which is *7799*9*Phone Number # allows customers to block access to their Bank Accounts, hence without recourse to the Bank, a customer is able to prevent and protect his Bank Account from unauthorised access using any mobile device if fraud is suspected.\n\nAs part of the robust feature of the Bank\u2019s USSD platform, Bank customers can directly initiate the new Code and successfully block the account from a third-party mobile device.\n\nTo unblock the Bank account, customers can walk into any branch of Unity Bank closest to them and request reactivation.\n\nAs a result, customers are thus able to exercise unlimited control with the new code as the Account Blockade can be initiated from any phone to prevent any unauthorised transaction or access to the Bank Account. The blockade can also be initiated to stem risks arising from the loss of debit card or incidences of unauthorized transactions.\n\nThis feature now offers full control to Unity Bank customers to protect themselves from scams, secure all banking transactions, and puts the customers well ahead in control of their banking transactions.\n\nThe new anti-fraud code enhances the Bank\u2019s robust security system to safeguard customers\u2019 bank accounts against any form of cyber threat or incurring financial losses from fraud attempts.\n\nAccording to the latest banking industry fraud report by Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System, cyber fraud rose by 534% as Nigerian banks lost a total of N3.5 billion in the past year alone. The unveiling of the new USSD code is, therefore, part of Unity Bank\u2019s strategic move to protect their customers by reducing to zero, losses from electronic banking frauds.\n\nThe *7799# code which was introduced three years ago and enhanced with a multi-language capability has remained a critical component of the Bank\u2019s robust e-banking channels facilitating seamless and secure banking transactions.\n\nSpeaking on the new anti-fraud code, the Directorate Head, E-Business, Retail & SME Banking, Mr. Funwa Akinmade said that leveraging necessary technology to protect the bank\u2019s assets including customer\u2019s Bank account remains a top priority for the Bank in the face of rising cyber-security threats.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith fraud concerns on major payment channels across Nigeria, every player in the financial services industry in Nigeria must think of a way to stay ahead of its game\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith the added USSD feature that allows customers to block their accounts using *7799*9*Phone Number# code, even from a third party device, we have given greater empowerment to customers to transact freely on our USSD platform. With the USSD feature, being available to both smartphone and feature phone users, it means even the least digital-savvy customers of Unity Bank can effectively use the new anti-fraud code\u201d.\n\n\u201cMore so, since the USSD is available in the three major local languages, it, therefore, has the potential to reach the greatest number of people who are looking for convenient and secure banking services.\u201d\n\nThe unveiling of the new anti-fraud code on the USSD platform is also accompanied by the rollout of a nationwide radio campaign to educate the banking public on the options available to them to bank safely and securely.\n\n#\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nNigeria Customs Service has busted a network of pangolin scales exporters, a prohibited animal product, after a raid of a house in Lagos.\n\nThe raid on 28 July was aided by the intelligence provided by the Wildlife Justice Commission.\n\nIt led to the arrest of three suspects and seizure of 196 sacks containing 7,137 kg of pangolin scales, 4.6 kg of pangolin claws and 846.34 kg of ivory.\n\nAll the wildlife products were destined for export, according to a statement released today by the Customs and the Wildlife Justice Commission.\n\nAdditional suspects are being sought in respect to this seizure, some of whom are believed to have already fled Nigeria.\n\nThis is the ninth largest seizure of pangolin scales in the last three years (2019-2021),\n\nAccording to the statement, the arrested suspects are part of a well-known transnational criminal network operating in West Africa.\n\nThey are linked to approximately 50% of all major pangolin scale seizures over the past three years.\n\n\u201cThese arrests have severely disrupted this network\u201d, the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe Wildlife Justice Commission wishes to congratulate Nigeria Customs for their quick response resulting in this outstanding outcome against a well-established transnational organised crime network,\u201d said Steve Carmody, Wildlife Justice Commission Director of Programs.\n\n\u201cThe truly horrific reality of this seizure is that even at seven tonnes, there were still eight other larger seizures in the last three years, and this network was responsible for at least half of them. We look forward to the arrest of the other wanted subjects and seeing proceeds of crime provisions applied to seize the ill-gotten gains of this network.\u201d\n\nLarge-scale and sustained trafficking of pangolin scales, sourced for jewellery and as a component of traditional Chinese medicine, is driving the species to the brink of extinction.\n\nDuring 2020, Wildlife Justice Commission investigators were offered staggering quantities of pangolin scales, outnumbering the offers of ivory across all the organisation\u2019s investigations for the first time.\n\nThis fact demonstrates the continued availability of pangolin scales and ongoing marketplace demand, despite COVID-19 travelling restrictions.\n\nThe Wildlife Justice Commission had also identified that wildlife traders were stockpiling their products in order to resume trade as soon as restrictions were eased, a concern that has now been justified by seizures of massive amounts of pangolin scales such as this one.\n\nThe Wildlife Justice Commission had pointed out in recent reports that pangolin scales are increasingly substituted for, and trafficked alongside, ivory, a trend that the organisation already identified in 2019.\n\nAs ivory prices fall, traffickers are increasingly turning to pangolin scales; in combined shipments, the proportion of pangolin scales has surpassed the volume of ivory.\n\n\u201cThis operation is a great example of how transnational wildlife crimes should be investigated and the tangible results that public-private partnerships can achieve by working together to disrupt organised crime,\u201d said Carmody.\n\n\u201cThis operation is a major victory for law enforcement and for the Wildlife Justice Commission, but we must acknowledge that other actors will rise to take the place of those recently arrested.\n\n\u201cThe Wildlife Justice Commission will use the evidence gathered through this arrest to continue our investigations into the trafficking of endangered wildlife and support the efforts of law enforcement agencies fighting wildlife crime. It takes a network to defeat a network.\u201d\n\nSince it was established in 2015, the Wildlife Justice Commission has facilitated the arrest of 151 wildlife traffickers and the dismantling of 35 criminal networks.\n\nThe wildlife products seized during this operation represent the largest quantity of pangolin scales and second largest seizure of ivory ever facilitated by the organisation.",

Incidentally, many of the contracts were split supposedly to beat federal procurement regulations.\n\nDocuments showed, for instance, that on March 18, 2021, 39 different vouchers totaling N311.0 million were raised for the procurement of items such as customized jotters, customized pens, T-shirts, umbrellas, mugs, hats, executive organizers, power banks were awarded.\n\nSimilarly, on April 12, 2021, 32 different vouchers were raised, on May 4, 2021, 26 vouchers were raised, while on June 9, 2021, 30 vouchers were raised for the procurement of the same items as above worth hundreds of millions of naira.\n\nManagement of FIRS and National Civil Service Union (NCSU) are currently battling in the National Industrial Court over issues of staff welfare. FIRS had asked the court to stop NCSU from either going on strike or picketing any of its offices while the union asked that management be refrained from enforcing its proscription order.\n\nManagement of the Service was also accused of spending about N3 billion on printing of non-security documents in a year when Nami at a National Assembly hearing asked that the 3.5 per cent cost of collection allotted to it be increased to seven per cent.\n\nFew weeks after he took office in December 2019, Nami accused his predecessor of spending too much on recurrent expenditure thereby plunging the Service into a N38 billion debt.\n\nOn Monday, some staff accused Nami of over bloating the staff of FIRS by increasing it from 9,409 in December 2019 to over 12,000 currently. He was also accused of never advertising vacancies but recruiting all the additional over 3,000 staff secretly. Nigerian Tribune is in possession of a fresh letter of employment issued on June 30, 2021.\n\nDespite spending over N5 billion on souvenirs and non -security documents, there are allegations that staff have not been paid their conventional annual performance bonuses while their performance appraisals have not been reviewed in the last six consecutive quarters.\n\nWhen contacted, FIRS Director of Communication and Liaison, Abdullahi Ismaila Ahmad denied the allegations. In reply to a message asking him for comments, he simply replied \u201cnot true really.\u201d",

Elijah, Secretary General of the AFN.\n\n\u201cThe AFN duly authorised Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited to deal with Puma on behalf of the federation in a letter dated June 23, 2019, signed by Patrick Estate, Head Marketing; and there is no evidence that Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited received money meant for AFN from Puma.\n\n\u201cIn view therefore, it is reiterated that the FMYSD and the AFN board should employ internal mechanism to resolve the lingering dispute between them.\u201d\n\nMinistry shuns AFN peace move, heads to Supreme Court\n\nThe Ministry of Youth and Sports Developmentearlier shunned reconciliatory moves by the Athletics Federation of Nigeria and headed to the Supreme Court to contest an Appeal Court judgment, which recognised Ibrahim Gusau as the president of the AFN.\n\nThe move comes a day after The PUNCHreported the AFN saying they were ready for negotiations with the sports ministry for peace to reign in the federation.\n\nGusau also dragged the sports ministry to the Federal High Court in Abuja, with the court ruling July 1 that he remained the AFN president.\n\nThe Appeal Court also affirmed the High Court ruling, throwing out the sports ministry\u2019s appeal for lacking merit September 25.\n\nA source in the sports ministry said two Senior Advocates of Nigeria would lead the ministry\u2019s legal team.",

They are physically drained especially, having heard that some are already dead. They have been running around to appeal for funds and the funds are not forthcoming,\u201d the source said.\n\nOne of the parents, who did not want his name mentioned, told our reporter that the situation is so traumatic and unbearable for him and other parents whose children were abducted.\n\nAsked on the next course of action, the parent replied, \u201cThe bandits can have the children forever while we their parents leave their matter in the hands of God.\u201d\n\n\u201dI cannot sleep, nothing in life now gives me joy, especially not knowing if my child is dead or alive. It is so traumatizing. We wanted the government to enter the forest then in Niger state, but some of us refused fearing for the lives of the children. Despite our fears, today some have died.

          "title": "PDP crisis: Atiku opens up on Portharcourt meeting as Secondus begs aggrieved national officers",
          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in 2019 general elections and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has explained his recent meeting with Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt.\n\nSpecifically, he said it was not targeted at removing the Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) but a move to mend fences within the party.\n\nAtiku spoke against the backdrop of speculations that Wike and himself met in Port Harcourt on strategies to get the NWC members sacked.\n\nThe position followed the rumbling within the major opposition party, culminating in the resignation of its national officers Tuesday.\n\nPrior to that time, three governors namely Dave Umahi of Ebonyi, Ben Ayade of Cross River and Mohammad Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, had dumped the PDP for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAtiku denies rumour\n\nBut speaking to journalists in a telephone interview, Atiku described the insinuation as \u201cbeer parlour talk.\u201d\n\nSpeaking Wednesday through his media adviser, Paul Ibe, the former vice president said: \u201cIt is a beer parlour talk, it is also mischief. Why will a former vice president be behind the plot to sack PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus? What will be his interest? Someone who has commenced the process of having conversations with stakeholders of the party on reconciliation, a man who has encouraged processes aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the party.\u201d\n\nHe explained that \u201cthe trip he made to Port Harcourt, he made a similar one to Delta. And he has more in the offing. Why will he promote peace and stability in the party and be behind moves to sack Secondus? It\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to talk about this.\n\n\u201cAtiku understands the Constitution of the PDP and what the party says about tenure for party leadership. So he cannot be working against something that he understands. That is not how democrats behave, those are anti-democratic behaviour and that is not who he is. Whoever is saying this, should know it is beer parlour talk and unnecessary mischief.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on his principal\u2019s efforts to resolve the crisis, Ibe said: \u201cThe crisis is related, we cannot isolate one from the other. He recognizes that there are issues, like in every party administration. When you have more than two persons, people will have different positions, so the important thing is how to resolve them. And he has commenced the movement to resolve the issues.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PDP stakeholders met late Tuesday night and agreed that everyone should go back to their zone to consult on the state of the party.\n\nA reliable source who spoke to Blueprint in confidence said \u201csome National Working Committee (NWC) members, members of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT) and stakeholders met Tuesday night, at party\u2019s Legacy Office, Maitama in Abuja to discuss the state of the party.\n\n\u201cParty stakeholders that attended the meeting, which lasted till about 3 am of Wednesday, agreed that everyone should go back to their zone and consult other party chieftains on the state of the party.\u201d\n\nSecondus begs\n\nIn a related development, the PDP National Chairman, Prince Secondus met with the seven national officers of the party, who resigned from office, Tuesday, over what they described as poor leadership.\n\nBlueprint correspondent gathered that four representatives of those national officers who resigned met with the embattled national chairman at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja Wednesday.\n\nA top party source who spoke under anonymity revealed that Secondus begged the aggrieved seven to allow all of them finish peacefully and not to rubbish all the successes the team had achieved so far.\n\nThe representatives, Blueprint gathered, told the chairman they would convey his message to the aggrieved national officers and revert to him.\n\nDickson wants emergency NEC\n\nMeanwhile, former Bayelsa state governor and lawmaker representing Bayelsa West senatorial district in the National Assembly, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson urged the NWC to summon an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, adding that their powers under the constitution should be utilised to discipline erring members involved in the nefarious plot to destroy the party\n\nIn a statement, Wednesday, Dickson said: \u201cWe have observed for some time the growing tension, recriminations and outright attack on the National Chairman and members of the National Working Committee by some leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cBy the party\u2019s constitution the appropriate authority, the NWC is empowered to make replacements. I, therefore, call on the National Chairman and other members of the NWC in accordance with the constitution of the party to immediately make appropriate consultations from the states and zones from which these officers have resigned and forthwith, make those replacements subject to ratification by the NEC.\n\n\u201cAn emergency NEC meeting should be convened which should take appropriate decisions to stabilise the party. And if there is any member of the working committee who wants to resign, such a person should consider the overall interest of the party and have a rethink. If however, any NWC members goes ahead to resign, the resignation should be accepted and consultations be made by the Chairman and NWC to fill those positions as temporary vacancies subject to ratification.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman and NWC members should utilise their powers under the constitution to discipline erring members involved in the nefarious plot to destroy the party. PDP is bigger than any individual and should no longer tolerate people with inordinate ambitions to destroy the party which belongs to all Nigerians. People with ambition must know that unless the party is stabilized and strengthened, their ambition will be of no consequence even if they pocket it\u201d.\n\nBut in all of this, Chairman of the PDP Reconciliation and Strategy Committee, Senator Bukola Saraki has maintained silence since the party crisis broke out.\n\nSaraki who was contacted through his Media Adviser, Yusuf Olaniyonu, did not answer his calls nor reply to messages.",
