This directive was issued on Saturday at the end of the executive meeting of the National Executive Council of the union held in Umuahia, the Abia State capital.\n\nA NAN correspondent who monitored some hospitals in Yola reports that Corps members could be seen offering skeletal services to some patients with emergencies.\n\nThe NYSC doctors and other senior medical officers also attended to patients with emergency cases.\n\nNAN reports that the strike also affected many departments and units, including the Accidents and Emergency units, Paediatric and Intensive Care Units as well as Labour Ward and surgical theatres among other services.\n\nReacting, Mr Adamu Dodo, Head of Information and Media Relations, FMC, Yola, said that the hospital was not completely shut down due to the strike.\n\n\u201dEverything is normal. Hospital is a teamwork setting, strengthened by synergy between and among the medical professionals and health workers,\u201d Dodo said.\n\nHe noted that NARD was only one category of medical doctors.\n\n\u201dThere are doctors from the ranks of Principal Medical Officers (PMO) and above, the Consultants and the NYSC, who were doing their best to attend to patients.\n\n\u201dThis is to say that the entire service windows are opened, you\u2019ve seen it yourself; the admission wards, the Accident and Emergency Unit and Labour Wards,\u201d he said.\n\nDodo confirmed that the only unusual circumstances being experienced were the workload shouldered by the dedicated NYSC doctors.\n\nNAN reports that NARD cited the inability of the Federal Government to meet the demands of the doctors as part of the reasons for the decision to go on strike. The NARD apologised to Nigerians for the decision which it insisted was a result of the government\u2019s failure in its responsibilities.\n\nThe resolutions reached at the end of the meeting said after critical appraisal of the performance of both Federal and State Governments on all the issues affecting the welfare of our members as observed above and the insincerity of government in implementing the memorandum of action after 113 days, the NEC unanimously resolved by vote to resume the total and indefinite on Aug. 2.\n\nThe NEC in particular demanded the immediate withdrawal of the circular removing House Officers from the scheme of service.\n\nFinally, the NEC stated unequivocally, especially to the members of the public, that the NARD is committed to the smooth running of the health sector; however, it can only do so when its welfare is given the desired attention.\n\nNAN reports that the doctors had embarked on industrial action in April, leaving many patients unattended across various government-owned hospitals in the country.\n\nThey later suspended it 10 days later following a virtual meeting with members which lasted about 15 hours on April 10.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2014Says only 14.3% of 35,000 federal roads eligible\n\n\u2014Vehicles to pay between N150 and N500 toll per trip\n\n\u2013Exempts diplomatic, military, para-military vehicles, tricycles, motorcycles\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, ABUJA\n\nTHE Federal Government yesterday announced that it was set to reintroduce toll collections on some selected dual carriage highways across the country.\n\nThe government also said that diplomatic vehicles, tricycles, motorcycles, military and Para-military vehicles will be exempted from paying tools.\n\nThis is coming 18 years after the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo dismantled all toll plazas on federal roads across the country in 2003.\n\nThe Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola stated this while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the virtual Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, at the First Lady\u2019s Conference room, Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe Minister said only 14.3 per cent of the entire 35,000 kilometres federal roads that are dual carriageways will be eligible for tolling with vehicles paying between N150 and N500 per trip depending on their make.\n\nThe Minister said his Ministry presented a memo which the Council approved for tolling to be reintroduced on dual carriageways of the 35,000 kilometres federal roads.\n\nHe added that dual carriageways represent only 5,050 kilometres out of the total 35,000 kilometres.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo the total network of roads today, assuming we wanted to start today, which we\u2019re not that will be eligible for tolling on the federal network will be 14.3 per cent of the total network. So 85.27 per cent will not be eligible for tolling. We have seen that most of those dual carriageways also have alternative roads, but they are single carriageways that\u2019s why we left them. So the only exception to single carriageway are some bridges and they are listed in the regulation.\u201d\n\nHe said with the FEC giving a go-ahead for the reintroduction of toll plazas in selected roads, modalities were being worked out to determine how soon the tolling system will take off.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe Ministry of Works and housing presented a policy memorandum for the approval of federal roads, bridges, tolling policy, and also a regulation that will provide legal framework for the tolling policy. So we have taken another step. So let me be clear, tolls are not going to start tomorrow. So let us be clear about that.\n\n\u201cBut the big step to actual tolling was taken today (yesterday) by presenting for approval the broad policy that will guide the tolling so that local people, states, local governments, all those who manage roads, investors who want to come in, will know what our tolling policy is. And that will form the basis of their financial modelling, their investment decision.\u201d\n\nFashola emphasised that the open tolling system to be introduced will not commence until the affected roads are put in good shape, while agreements as to how the plazas will have to be negotiated with relevant government agencies.\n\nHe said: \u201cFirst of all, the toll will not start until roads are motorable. So let\u2019s be clear about this.\n\n\u201d There will be agreements that have to be placed, negotiated with the government through the Ministry of Works and the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission. Some of the highlights are that we will adopt an open tolling policy as distinct from a closed tolling policy. The difference is that only open tolling policy, which is what we were used to before you pay to at a barrier over a fixed or predetermined distance.\n\n\u201cThe close toll systems means that you will pay tolls over the distance you travel and the size of your vehicle. We haven\u2019t operated that before. So we are going back to what we know. We also approve that consultations must be done. Willingness to pay surveys must be done before specific roads are tolled.\u201d\n\nFashola explained that the toll collected apart from being used to maintain the roads will also be used to construct new ones while the toll system will be electronically driven for transparency.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe also got approval that the toll will be used to maintain roads, to construct new roads as they accrue and also to pay the investors who invest in building or completing a road and then take a concession on it. Those are the uses.\n\n\u201cWe will also be going through a process of largely electronic toll collection and management system for audit and transparency. We\u2019ll still have some cash at the very many more and hopefully phased that out as we go ahead.\u201d\n\nOn the vehicles to be exempted from paying tolls, he said, \u201cWe have proposed and the council has approved that certain types of vehicles be exempted for paying tolls. Those are bicycles, pedal cycles, try cycles, motorcycles, and others that have two or three-wheeled transport used mainly by disadvantaged members of our community, they will be entitled to a full 100% exemption, as will be diplomatic and military and paramilitary vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe concede this as a national policy that\u2019s why we\u2019re making a very general framework. So that states can also decide subject to their local laws, local government can do their own tolling based on all of these considerations as a broad framework.\u201d\n\nFashola emphasised that the government consulted widely with both stakeholders in both the public and private sectors before agreeing to reintroduce toll on federal highways.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe met with a lot of people, we met with government agencies first of all, but more importantly, we met with the private sector and organised labour. Nobody that we met with opposes the idea of tolling, at least none of the people that we\u2019ve met with opposed it.\n\n\u201cSome of the people you might wish to know are members of the National Assembly, the Senate, and House of Reps committees oversight us so that they can take this feedback to their constituents. We had consultations with the Office of National Security Advisor, Bureau of Public Enterprises, the Ministry of communication and the digital economy, which will be helping us with the electronic and digital aspects of it.\n\n\u201cWe also then met with those who are affected by the tolls themselves, Ministry of Transportation, who supervises a part of the transport business and then the road transport employers Association, the National Association of road transport owners (NARTO) and National Union Road transport workers (NUTRW) and Ministry of Trade and Investment, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection council. These are some of the people who have made very useful input which has been embedded in some policies that I have spoken about.\u201d\n\nHe added that vehicles plying the tolled highways will pay between N200 and N500 per trip depending on the capacity of the vehicle.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need to have a kick-off policy. So we\u2019ve classified vehicles into five categories, cars, SUVs and jeeps as a second category. Private bus and commercial bus as third and fourth categories. And then luxury buses and trucks as a fifth category.\n\n\u201cSo the start off tolls that we have for financial modelling and investment decision making, cars will pay N200, SUVs and Jeeps will pay N300, private busses will pay N300, commercial buses will pay N150, luxury buses and trucks will pay N500.\n\n\u201cNow I think it is important to share with you how we arrived at these prices. Some of these prices were recommended by the operators themselves that I said we met. Some of them were also obtained from a survey we did across the six geo-political zones, talking to households and talking to people in the garages, motor parks and all of that, which was quite extensive. We covered about 17 or so states or 22 states out of the national framework just to get a sampling of what people felt.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "*First degree took just 4 years\n\n*Says I have no regrets; Supreme Court vindicated me\n\nIt was in the inglorious days of the Abacha administration that Rasheedat Adesina, Barrister at Law, had the misfortune in 1995 of becoming an undergraduate of the University of Ilorin.\n\nThe erstwhile Vice-Chancellor, Professor Shuaib Abdulraheem Oba, an Ilorin indigene, had just assumed office and had justifiably hoped, according to Adesina, to have the latter\u2019s full support in running his affairs.\n\nNever had Adesina imagined that a routine protest against a fee hike at the university would have her battling in the courts and beyond, with Professor Oba and the institution for her certificate for the next two decades.\n\nAs she is finally called to the Nigerian Bar this year, an exulted Rasheedat shares her incredible story with WO\n\nWhat informed your decision to join the Student Union as a fresh student of the University of Ilorin?\n\nI became a convinced Marxist in 1995 when I gained admission into the University of Ilorin to study Industrial Chemistry. This marvelous idea was introduced to me by my best friend and life partner; comrade Kazeem Akinrinde (aka comrade Kazy), who was already on Campus before me. I was put forward to a contest in the Student Union in 1997 by my organization. As a radical Marxist candidate, I won that election overwhelmingly.\n\nWhat was the cause of the conflict between you and your Vice-Chancellor?\n\nOba, as an Ilorin indigene mobilized lecturers and students who were also Ilorin indigenes against everybody and everything else. With the Emir and Government on his side, he was deeply pained and terribly disappointed that I did not only decline to be a tool in his hands, but ended up being the leader of one of the most powerful student oppositions. He vowed that over his dead body would I graduate from the campus. On several occasions, he vowed to ensure that he ruined my life and make sure that I everlastingly regret my stand.\n\nWas it at this point that you went to court?\n\nThen commenced the long and difficult legal battles that ran for almost It started in 1998 when there was an astronomical increase in the school fees. Having banned the local union, myself and other comrades along with the NANS Zone D massively mobilized students against this hated fee hike.\n\nOur peaceful protest was brutally crushed by both the internal security of the university, as well as the police. Many students were arrested, including the NANS Zone D representative who came in Ladoke Akintola\u2019s (LAUTECH) Students Union bus. Even the bus was detained and taken to the police headquarters in Ilorin. The arrested students and the NANS Zone D representative; comprising students from LAUTECH and OAU were all detained and imprisoned at the Oke Kura Maximum Security Prison in Ilorin for more than 30days.\n\nI only narrowly escaped, then surprised to read in almost all the then-popular newspapers that I have been declared wanted. I could only imagine the trauma this had on my parents. I immediately went underground. As is always the case, suspension from school immediately followed.\n\nI challenged this unjust suspension at the Federal High Court in Ilorin and I won, but the university authorities in their characteristic manner refused to abide by the court order. I had to go back to court to get a committal order (form 48 and 49) before I could be allowed to sit for exams. It was such a very difficult period; you would have exam the following day and won\u2019t be sure you would be allowed. Whenever I had an exam, I would go into the exam hall with the court order. My final year examination in the year 2000 started and ended in this manner. I would take out the court order and asked the person to sign that he/she was disobeying the court order.\n\nThe Administration refused to release my result and consequently, my certificate. I returned to Federal High Court in 2004 to challenge this injustice and won in 2005. The University Administration appealed to the Court Of Appeal. At the Court of Appeal, once again I won in 2006. The management proceeded to Supreme Court to further appeal.\n\nHow did you become a lawyer?\n\nIn 2010, ten years after graduating and without a certificate, I decided to go back to school to read Law. This was not accidental, because I have been in and out of court and law chambers throughout my stay in the University of Ilorin. I was with Comrade Barrister Segun Sango my first Counsel in 1998, then Barrister Baiyeshea chambers and finally Citi-point chambers. I was already very familiar with some legal terminologies; form 48 and 49, injunctions, affidavit among others. I was already joining lawyers to prepare briefs for my cases. As a pure science student, the journey looked too long and daunting, but with determination I commenced. I had to start from scratch. I wrote GCE in 2011, proceeded to write Jamb in 2012 and Post UTME. Finally gained admission to study law at the University of Ibadan in the 2013/14 session. Along the line, the Supreme Court delivered a favorable final judgment on the case on June 6, 2014, after 14years of graduation, and already a 200L Law student. Though millions of Naira was eventually paid in damages, the really good news was that my certificate was released while Professor Oba is still alive.\n\nLooking back, I have no any iota of regret, as we always say, Aluta Continua and Victoria Ascerta. Throughout this long and tortuous year, I still remain solidly committed to the cause. The battle has only successfully strengthened my resolve to join all the revolutionaries to overthrow this monstrous Capitalist System and build in its place, a more humane society where human beings can freely develop their full potentials unhindered.\n\nLooking at the Student Unions of higher institutions today, can you compare them with the old days?\n\nStudent Unions of higher institutions today cannot be compared with the past. There was a time in the history of this country when students were at the forefront of agitation not only for the direct interest of their fellow students but also directly involved in national issues. Most student unions today are completely dependent and mere extensions of the school authorities. Now, \u201cstudents\u2019 leaders\u201d wish to be punished so that he/she can raise support funds to travel out of the country on the sympathetic level. Some want to go to detention for them to be able to collect money from one NGO sponsor or the other. The readiness to go all out for sacrifice, like during our days has really collapsed.\n\nHowever, the collapse is not restricted to the Student Unions alone. How are NASU, ASUU and others now? Absence of left radical organizations on our campuses is directly responsible for this decadence, but there is a deeper cause.\n\nFortunately, we are already seeing the resurgence of radical students in one campus after the other. Femi Adeyeye in Unilag is still being unjustly denied his right to education; there is a case of Phillips Alotinwo in UI who was expelled about 5 years ago and still has his case in court. The inhuman condition students have been subjected to, is already radicalizing a layer. Though this layer is still very small, we are very hopeful that students will win back their unions and NANS from the impostors currently heading them. We just need to give maximum support.\n\nGenerally speaking, what advice do you have for the #sorosoke movement and Nigerian youth agitators?\n\nThe #sorosoke movement no doubt was one of the most unprecedented youth movements in the history of the country. The movement, though spontaneous was in the real sense, an expression of the accumulated anger, frustration, and discontent of the majority of Nigerian youth, who unfortunately have been the worst hit by the crisis of capitalism in Nigeria, in terms of massive unemployment, abject poverty, and a very bleak future.\n\nThe scale and magnitude of this movement, the way, and manner it spread to many states in the country were commendable but one of the most significant weaknesses of this magnificent movement was the lack of serious organization and leadership that can provide the political direction for the movement. Ironically, those that the #sorosoke movement was directed against (the Nigerian ruling elite) are a very organised and determined force; they have all the apparatus of the state at their disposal and will do everything possible to protect and defend their interests. In order to effectively confront this monstrous power of the elite, serious organisation and revolutionary leadership is absolutely necessary. My advice to the courageous and determined Nigerian youth is for them to be fully involved in revolutionary politics; that is, politics in the interest of the majority as against the current bourgeois politics, which is always politics in the selfish interest of an insignificant few.\n\nWhat are your future plans-Law, Activism or Politics?\n\nThe cheapest and most basic of Nigeria\u2019s problems can no longer be solved by patching here and mending there. It is only through a Socialist Revolution that genuine emancipation of the working class and downtrodden can genuinely be won.\n\nTherefore, my future plan is to renew my commitment and dedication to this cause. The war of the elite against the people is still on and raging, the journey is still very far. The country is sinking, there is general decadence in the society, and the legal system in the country is not also immune to this decadence. I plan to exploit the law in the defense of the oppressed working class and the poor while having it in mind that real emancipation and justice for the working class and the poor can only be achieved through the revolutionary overthrow of this blood-sucking system of capitalism. The struggle continues until the final victory.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has hinted that the over two months suspension of Twitter\u2019s activities in Nigeria will soon be lifted following agreement that has been reached in most areas of contention with the platform.\n\nThe government had, on June 5, 2021, officially put an indefinite ban on Twitter, restricting it from operating in Nigeria after the social media platform deleted tweets made by President Muhammadu Buhari warning the Indigenous People of Biafra that they will be treated in the language they understand.\n\nThe government said the deletion of the president\u2019s tweets was based on \u201ca litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences.\u201d\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lal Mohammed, while responding to questions to give update on the face off, told State House Correspondents at the end of a Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, that progress has been made in resolving the impasse following series of meetings.\n\nMohammed gave more details of the conditions given to the platform, saying most of them have been accepted.\n\nHe said the areas still pending such as Twitter setting up an office, and having a Twitter staff of management cadre that will serve as the country representative, are still being discussed.\n\nThe minister revealed that in the area of a Nigerian office, even though Twitter has agreed to the condition, it is, however, maintaining that the earliest it can establish it is 2022.\n\nThe minister expressed confidence that everything will be ironed out with Twitter within a few days or weeks, noting the anxiety that has been shown by Nigerians.\n\nHe said the Federal Government\u2019s committee negotiating with Twitter will meet on the agreement soon to make recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe question I think has to do with the status of the conversation between us and the Twitter company. I want to say the end for an amicable solution is very much insight. We quite appreciate the anxiety of Nigerians who have been worried that two months after the suspension, we\u2019ve not been able to finalise talks, but I just want to assure you we have made tremendous progress. And when I say tremendous, I really mean tremendous. We\u2019ve engaged Twitter both in writing. We\u2019ve engaged Twitter, we set up a technical committee to engage Twitter, they set up their own committee too. They have met virtually, and have exchanged correspondents about three times.\n\n\u201cApart from dotting the I\u2019s and crossing the T\u2019s, we\u2019re actually almost there. I don\u2019t want to say the engagement has been extremely positive, devoid of any acrimony. As a matter of fact, is to the credit of Twitter that they admitted they\u2019ve never received any kind of informed or detailed or professional communication from any country as they have received from us. Not only did they promise they were going to look into it, but we made it very clear what we wanted from Twitter.\n\n\u201cEven though our report is not ready, even though we\u2019re still expecting more clarifications around some conversation with Twitter, I think I can share with you some of our conditions for Twitter operations to resume in Nigeria. I\u2019m glad both the Minister of Works, who is a member of the ministerial team, Tolu Ogunlesi, who also serves on the technical committee, are here. So, if I\u2019m wrong they\u2019d correct me. But I know one of the conditions we set was that Twitter, in line with Nigeria\u2019s Companies and Allied Matters Act, should establish presence in Nigeria with registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission. And we think that it is only thing if you want to do business in Nigeria, you must register first, a Nigerian company and of course, you must have an address. That\u2019s one of the conditions we gave Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe also asked that Twitter should be mandated to employ a designated country representative. As of today, we are not aware of any Twitter representative in Nigeria, and we say representative shall be a staff of Twitter so that he can have access to global management of Twitter. So that he can serve as a liaison between Nigeria and Twitter. The company representative should also have a physical office address in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe also asked Twitter, in addition to registering the Nigerian company, to register with relevant regulatory authorities like National Information Technology Development Agency, Nigeria Communications Commission and National Broadcasting Commission.\n\n\u201cWe asked that Twitter shall be mandated to retain designated local agents to manage its engagement with the Federal Government operations in Nigeria. We also asked Twitter to commit itself to working with the Federal Inland Revenue Service, you know if you make money from Nigeria, you pay taxes according to Nigerian laws. Of course, start paying VAT and other tax liabilities of any company resident in Nigeria. We also proposed to Twitter that we should agree on a charter of online conduct for content management. So that this charter will guide both of us, we will agree on which content would be acceptable, what\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer minister of works, Adeseye Ogunlewe, has urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the 2023 presidency to the South West while claiming only former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu can lead the party to victory.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News, Ogunlewe claimed that not even Vice President Yemi Osinbaji, Minister of Power, Babatunde Fashola and Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State can defeat Tinubu in any political contest because.\n\n\u201cMy personal prayer is that the presidency should be zoned to the South West because we have the capacity to manage the economy of Nigeria properly and there is no other person that I can support other than former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu. Politics is an investment. You have to invest your time, money and knowledge before people can listen to you and that is what he has done.\n\n\u201cWe have people who have followed politics for a while, Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar are such persons. They have the mental capacity and structure to get things done in their favour, so anyone that wants to compete with him should start early because he would outmaneuver you and win. You have to be grounded in the politics of Nigeria to survive. It is very difficult and almost impossible to upstage APC in Lagos State\n\n\u201cIf you know the history of Lagos State, you will agree that Yemi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Kayode Fayemi are all members of the same political family and the father of that family is Tinubu. Whatever he says, all of them will crumble. Who can face him one-on-one? He made them and he will tell them how he has been able to raise them and they will sit down and say, \u2018Leader, have the first shot, but if you fail, consider me,\u201d\u2019 Ogunlewe said.\n\nBut reacting, Olabode George, former national vice chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for South West, said if the former Lagos governor emerges president, he would renounce his citizenship.\n\nHe accused the APC leader of not performing during his tenure as governor.\n\n\u201cOgunlewe was talking about Tinubu emerging president, someone who is the greatest headache of politics in Nigeria today?

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu and Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) has concluded plans to pay N45.9 billion as compensation to the people of Ogoni in Rivers State as compensation for oil spills in their communities which occurred in 2010\n\nLawyer to Shell, A. O Ejelamo, while addressing Ahmed Mohammed, Judge of a Federal High Court in Abuja, said the company has resolved to pay the monetary compensation awarded in 2010.\n\nBut a spokesperson for The SPDC in response to Daily Sun inquiry said: \u2018\u2018The order for the payment of N45.9 billion to the claimants is for full and final satisfaction of the judgement in the suit, Chief Agbara and Others v. SPDC, in respect of the spills which we maintain were caused by third parties during the Nigerian Civil War, a challenging period which resulted in significant damage to oil and gas infrastructure in the Niger Delta region. While the SPDC Joint Venture does not accept responsibility or liability for these spills, the affected sites in the Ebubu community were fully remediated.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn 2001, 10 representatives of the Ogoni people instituted the suit against the oil company for the losses allegedly caused by the oil spills.\n\nIbrahim Buba, then of Port-Harcourt Division of the Federal High Court, in June 2010, gave judgment in favour of the Ogoni people awarding N17 billion as compensation.\n\nThe court equally granted the Ogoni chiefs a 25-percent interest charge on the principal sum of about N17 billion.\n\nSPDC appealed against the judgment up to the Supreme Court \u2013 it lost.\n\nIn 2020, the company had also approached the apex court seeking a review of the judgment debt.\n\nBut while delivering a ruling in November 2020, the five-member panel, led by Olabode Rhodes- Vivour, a former justice of the Supreme Court, unanimously dismissed Shell\u2019s application, saying it lacked merit.\n\nLucius Nwosu, lead counsel to the Ogoni communities had noted that the judgement sum, with the accrued interests, stood at about N182 billion.\n\nAt the resumed court session on Wednesday, Ejelamo sought the court\u2019s permission to pay the debt through the chief registrar of the court in a bank account to be opened for the purpose.\n\nHowever, it was eventually agreed that the amount is paid to the aggrieved people through their lawyer.\n\nIt was learnt that the Ogonis waived the interest on the principal amount as concession agreed upon during reconciliation.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022Report: foreign investment flow to Nigeria decreased 48.5%\n\n\u2022US: OPEC must pump more oil to cut prices\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigeria\u2019s low share of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow to Africa between 2015 and 2019 is a cause of concern.\n\nBuhari, who spoke at a retreat organised by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, described the situation as unacceptable.\n\nIn another development, United States President Joe Biden\u2019s top aides are pressuring the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies to boost oil output to tackle rising petrol prices, which the US sees as a threat to global economic recovery, Reuters reported yesterday.\n\nBut in Nigeria, Buhari reaffirmed the country\u2019s commitment to using the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to implement reforms and enhance revenue growth.\n\nDespite having the biggest economy in Africa, Nigeria only received four per cent, which was about $3 billion of the $75 billion invested in the continent in the first term of Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2020 World Investment Report, FDI flows to Nigeria showed a 48.5 per cent decrease compared to the previous year.\n\nNigeria has a poorly developed transport and energy infrastructure, resulting in high operating costs, an inefficient judicial system and unreliable dispute settlement mechanism as well as serious security concerns.\n\nBuhari, who was represented at the occasion by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, urged the new NEITI board to build on the efficiency and ramp up on-going reforms in the oil and gas as well as mining sectors.\n\nThe president explained that NEITI\u2019s work strongly aligned with the vision of his administration to provide a robust governance framework in the oil and gas and mining sectors and guarantees professionalism, transparency, accountability, good returns on investment, as well as improved revenue for the country. He urged the new board to provide the required leadership and strategic direction for NEITI to channel similar attention it had shown in the oil and gas industry to the solid minerals sector to galvanise reforms in the sector.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cThe board of NEITI must articulate a new approach and seek productive collaborations, where necessary, to make Nigeria investment destination and dramatically increase the quantum of investments to the country.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable, a situation where only $3 billion came to Nigeria out of the $75 billion investment in the extractive industry that came into sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nHe charged the new board members to avoid acts capable of disrupting the day-to-day management of the agency.\n\n\u201cI have witnessed a lot of disruptions to agency activities due majorly to a misunderstanding and at times deliberate misinterpretation of roles,\u201d he stressed.\n\nIn his remarks, the chairman of the board, Mr Olusegun Adekunle, pledged the commitment of the team to push the boundaries of EITI implementation in Nigeria to achieve results.\n\nExecutive Secretary of NEITI, Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji, explained that the retreat was designed to expose members of the board to the methods, principles and benefits of EITI in Nigeria. Orji added that the retreat, which had global and national experts on EITI, law, public policy and administration as resource persons, was put together to build the capacity of the board to take up its leadership role with adequate knowledge and competence.\n\nHead of the international secretariat of EITI, Dr. Mark Robinson, in a message from the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Oslo, Norway, said the world body was ready and willing to offer technical assistance to the new board in the performance of its functions.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden\u2019s aides are pressuring OPEC and its allies to increase oil output to tackle rising petrol prices, which they see as threating global economic recovery.\n\nBiden\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Jake Sullivan, criticised the world\u2019s major oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, for what he said were insufficient crude production levels in the aftermath of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cAt a critical moment in the global recovery, this is simply not enough,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nPetrol prices in the United States are running at $3.18 a gallon at the pumps, up more than a dollar from last year at this time, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).\n\nThe unusual statement ratcheted up international pressure and comes as the administration tries to contain a range of rising prices and supply bottlenecks across the economy that have fuelled inflation concerns.\n\nBiden has made recovering from the economic recession triggered by the pandemic a key priority for his administration.\n\nThe message also underscored the new dynamic between Washington and OPEC since Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump, broke with prior practice in demanding specific policy changes to adjust prices.\n\nTrump had threatened to withdraw military support from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia over output, which at the time he thought was too high and hurting U.S.-based drillers.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration is pressing countries within OPEC+, which groups OPEC with Russia and other big producers, \u201con the importance of competitive markets in setting prices,\u201d Sullivan said, adding, \u201cHigher gasoline costs, if left unchecked, risk harming the on-going global recovery.\u201d\n\nThe US government said, \u201cOPEC+ must do more to support the recovery.\u201d\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude was trading around $70 a barrel yesterday, down half a per cent, after the US issued its statement, lower than the prices above $77 in early July, but still representing an increase of nearly a third from the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s push for lower fuel prices in some way shreds its efforts to secure global leadership in the fight against climate change, an agenda anchored by efforts to transition the economy away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources and electric vehicles.\n\nUS oil production has been stagnant at 11 million barrels per day (bpd) since the fallout of the pandemic pulled it from a record high of 12.3 million bpd in 2019.\n\nOPEC+ had implemented a record output cut of 10 million bpd, about 10 per cent of world demand, as global energy demand slumped during the pandemic, but has been gradually raising output since. As of July, the cut had been eased to about 5.8 million bpd.\n\nAt a meeting held in July, OPEC+ agreed to boost output by 400,000 bpd a month starting in August, until the rest of the 5.8 million bpd cut was phased out. OPEC+ is scheduled to hold another meeting on September 1 to review the situation.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, recently said high oil prices were not in the interest of resource-dependent countries, like Nigeria, arguing that the most comfortable threshold would be between $50 and $60.\n\nHe argued that if prices continued to rise, it would get to a point that buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil might find other alternatives, which could negatively affect the country\u2019s economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Akeredolu, with persons, who should know better, coming out with very malicious and self-serving opinions, just to play on the gullibility of the public, while forgetting that our party is made up of very intelligent, sound and intellectually proficient persons, who have seen beneath their grandstanding.\n\n\u201cThe majority judgment of the Supreme Court has strengthened the position of the CECPC and our Chairman. The minority judgment serves only for academic purposes, nothing more.\u201d\n\nBuni noted that the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, who is the chief law officer of the federation, has said the committee was on firm ground and advised that it should proceed with the processes of the congresses.\n\n\u201cIt is trite to note that, the Congresses to produce our party organs across had commenced on the 31st of July, 2021 and you will agree with me that it went substantially well.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is expected that where ever and whenever there\u2019s a competition, of course, there is bound to be contestations.\n\n\u201cTherefore as an organization based on rules and procedures, avenues and channels must be provided for party members who are dissatisfied with the processes, to ventilate their grievances through an internal mechanism, hence this Wards Congresses Appeals Committee in the circumstance of this exercise.\u201d\n\nThe chairman further pointed out that the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum through their extensive legal apparatchik had x-rayed the generality of the issues at their meeting held August 8, 2021, and reaffirmed their support for the committee and asked it to proceed with the congresses as scheduled.\n\nHe pointed out that while the congresses that would produce party organs across had commenced on the 31st of July, 2021, it was expected that wherever there was a competition, there was bound to be contestations.\n\n\u201cTherefore as an organisation based on rules and procedures, avenues and channels, must be provided for party members, who are dissatisfied with the processes, to ventilate their grievances through an internal mechanism, hence these Ward Congresses Appeals Committee in the circumstance of this exercise,\u201d Buni added.\n\nHe noted that the ruling party was for all Nigerians, therefore, the party must show, not only by words, but by concrete actions that there was no attempt to exclude or sideline anybody in the course of the exercise.\n\nThe chairman noted that the actions of the members in this regard would help engender cohesion, build trust and confidence in this all-important exercise.\n\nHe maintained that the committee has been entrusted with one of the most solemn obligations of citizenship, which was to help deepen democratisation processes and strengthen the polity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, disclosed this yesterday while briefing newsmen at the end of the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe planned reintroduction of tollgates comes 18 years after the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo dismantled all toll plazas on federal roads throughout the country in 2003.\n\nFashola said after the FEC meeting presided by the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, that only 5, 005 kilometres of dual carriageways out of the 35,000 kilometres of federal roads in the country\u2013 that is 14.3 per cent \u2013 would be eligible for tolling. He said vehicles would pay between N200 and N500 per trip, depending on their make.\n\nHowever, diplomatic, military, para-military vehicles, and as well as tricycles and motorcycles would be exempted from toll payment, the minister stated.\n\nFashola said his ministry presented a memo for the reintroduction of tollgates, which the council approved.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe total network of roads today, assuming we wanted to start today, which will be eligible for tolling on federal network will be 14.3 per cent of the total network.\n\n\u201cSo 85.27 per cent will not be eligible for tolling. We have seen that most of those dual carriageways also have alternative roads, but they are single carriageway. That was why we left them.\n\n\u201cThe only exception to single carriageway are some bridges and they are listed in the regulation.\u201d\n\nThe former Lagos State governor said with the council\u2019s go-ahead, modalities were being worked out to determine when the tolling system would take off.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThe Ministry of Works and Housing presented a policy memorandum for the approval of federal roads, bridges, tolling policy, and also a regulation that will provide legal framework for the tolling policy.\n\n\u201cWe have taken another step. So let me be clear, tolls are not going to start tomorrow. Let us be clear about that.\n\n\u201cBut the big step to actual tolling was taken today by presenting for approval the broad policy that will guide the tolling so that local people, states, local governments, all those who manage roads, investors who want to come in, will know what our tolling policy is. And that will form the basis of their financial modelling, their investment decision.\u201d\n\nFashola emphasised that the open tolling system to be introduced would not commence until the affected roads were motorable, while agreements as to the erection of the plazas would be negotiated with relevant government agencies.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst of all, toll will not start until roads are motorable. So let\u2019s be clear about this.\n\n\u201cThere will be agreements that have to be negotiated with government through the Ministry of Works and the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission.\n\n\u201cSome of the highlights are that we will adopt an open tolling policy, as distinct from a closed tolling policy. The difference is that only open tolling policy, which is what we were used to, you pay at a barrier over a fixed or predetermined distance.\n\n\u201cThe closed toll system means that you will pay tolls over the distance you travel and the size of your vehicle. We haven\u2019t operated that before. So we are going back to what we know. We also approved that consultations must be done. Willingness to pay surveys must be done before specific roads are tolled.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said the fees to be collected, apart from being used to maintain the roads, would be used to construct new roads, while the toll system would be electronically driven for transparency.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe also got approval that the toll will be used to maintain roads, to construct new roads as they accrue and also to pay the investors who invest in building or completing a road and then take a concession on it. Those are the uses.\n\n\u201cWe will also be going through a process of largely electronic toll collection and management system for audit and transparency.\u201d\n\nFashola stated, \u201cWe concede this as a national policy, that is why we are making general framework so that states can also decide, subject to their local laws, local governments can do their own tolling based on all of these considerations as a broad framework.\u201d\n\nFashola emphasised that government had consulted widely with both stakeholders in the public and private sectors before agreeing on the policy.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe met with a lot of people, we met with government agencies, first of all, but more importantly, we met with private sector and organised labour. Nobody that we met with opposed the idea of tolling, at least none of the people that we have met with opposed it.\n\n\u201cSome of the people, you might wish to know, are members of the National Assembly, Senate, and House of Representatives Committees oversighting us, so that they can take this feedback to their constituents.\n\n\u201cWe had consultations with the Office of the National Security Adviser, Bureau of Public Enterprises, the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, which will be helping us with the electronic and digital aspect of it.\n\n\u201cWe also met with those who are affected by the tolls themselves: Ministry of Transportation, who supervises a part of the transport business and, then, the Road Transport Employers Association, the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), and National Union of Road Transport Workers (NUTRW), and Ministry of Trade and Investment, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Council.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Military plots major offensive against insurgents, bandits\n\n\u2022Kaduna appeals for more troop deployments to flush out criminals\n\nDeji Elumoye,\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, said whatever situation that the country was going through was nothing alien to history as many great nations across the world, had and are still encountering the kinds of security and economic challenges that Nigeria currently faces.\n\nThis is coming at a time the military high command has concluded plans to launch an offensive against the remaining criminals in the North East and the North West as well asother parts of the country, where the criminals have continued to wage war against the state.\n\nRelatedly, the Kaduna State government, as if privy to the new plan by the military high command, has appealed to the Army to deploy more troops to the state to boost the ongoing operations against terrorists, bandits and kidnappers in the state.\n\nOsinbajo, who spoke while playing host to a delegation from the Arewa Concerned People for National Unity and Religious Tolerance from Kano, led by Alhaji Auwal Maidabino, stressed that there was no great nation anywhere that has not had the sort of challenge that Nigeria I currently faced with.\n\nThis, he claimed was especially so in countries, \u201cwhere you have a multi-racial, multi-religious setup, and the greatest nations in the world are multi-racial, multi-religious, and multi-ethnic.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, some of these things are as important as the economy and security\u2026 for the reason that a united people, people who see themselves as one, are more likely to be economically successful, more likely to be able to secure themselves and secure their borders, and more likely to work together for the goodness and greatness of their people.\u201d\n\nThe vice president told the delegation that, \u201cIt is the duty of the leadership, not just political leadership, but also the leadership of social groups and organisations such as yours, to ensure that we are focused on these issues of unity and tolerance.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo explained further that, \u201cAs you know, religious tolerance and unity, is for me, a matter that goes beyond mere advocacy. I believe very strongly that the greatness of nations, wherever those nations may be, have always been on account of leaders, who thought it fit to build those nations on the basis of unity and tolerance.\n\n\u201cI think that it is such an important issue that we cannot afford to discount it. There is a need for us to pay more time and attention to these issues in whatever way we can, because every once in a while, we see some threats to the unity of our country, and we must not allow it to happen at all, we must continue not just in the advocacy, but in action that will bring about unity and religious tolerance\u201d.\n\nLeader of the delegation, Alhaji Maidabino, who spoke earlier, commended Osinbajo for his innovative approach to governance and the several initiatives of the Buhari administration anchored through his office, praying God to provide the opportunity to enable him continue to serve the nation.\n\nHe noted that through schemes such as TraderMoni, National Homegrown School Feeding Programme, N-Power, and the Ease of Doing Business initiative, among others, the vice president has impacted many Nigerians across different sectors.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe wish to commend and congratulate you for your contributions in the area of promotion of good governance, transparency, and efficiency as exemplified with the core principles behind the Ease of Doing Business initiative of this government, and for the continuation of your uncompromising dedication to peace, unity, and economic progress, among others.\u201d\n\nMaidabinno informed Osinbajo of plans by the group to convene a national forum on unity as part of its contributions to entrenching peaceful coexistence and unity among Nigerians.\n\nMeanwhile, the decision by the military to launch an offensive followed refusal by more terrorists and bandits to lay down their arms after over 1000 of them, including their families, recently surrendered to the Nigerian troops.\n\nSecurity sources were of the view that the successes recorded so far were the outcome of the joint operations launched by the new service chiefs under the leadership of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor.\n\nThe planned concluding offensive, however, came as hundreds of roaming armed bandits were alleged to be regrouping in Zamfara State, one of the hot beds of armed banditry.\n\nAnother source, who spoke anonymously, said the surrender by the insurgents was the result of the joint operations launched by the military against terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing clearly the result of jointness, which was evidently missing in the past. The Chief of Army Staff and Chief of the Air Staff have demostrated jointness and the importance of collectivism in a war like this.\n\n\u201cThey see themselves as one. They don\u2019t look at individual trophies but a collective one. The welfare flights launched to airlift soldiers on pass was the jointness again. The service chiefs brought their experiences as former theatre commanders to bear.\n\n\u201cThe CDS is providing leadership. The CAS despite recent incidents has kept his eyes on the ball\u201d, the source, who retired at the equivalent rank of a major general, explained, adding that, \u201cThe jointness, synergy and collaboration are paying off,\u201d the source stated.\n\nWhen contacted on the planned offensive, Spokesman of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said, \u201cWe have no specific date for the deployment\u201d, but THISDAY sources insisted the deployment would be soon.\n\nCuriously, hundreds of armed bandits were said to have started regrouping in Zamfara State after military operations drove them out of Dansadau in Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the bandits were setting houses ablaze and killing villagers. \u201cMost of the bandits are said to be foreigners,\u201d a security source posited.\n\nDeputy Governor of Kaduna State, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, who appealed to the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, when he paid her a courtesy call at Government House, Kaduna, emphasized the need to deploy more troops to the state.\n\nBalarabe, while noting that the ongoing military operations in parts of the metropolis hadyielded positive results, also appealed to the Army Chief to firm up the attacks across the state to wipe out bandits.\n\nShe urged the COAS to deploy more troops along Kaduna-Kachia-Kafanchan roads as well as increased military presence along Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road to curb increasing cases of kidnappings by bandits.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing for more deployment of troops along the Kaduna-Kachia road. This is one place that in recent times, has become a very serious source of concern.\n\n\u201cInitially, we were thinking of the Kaduna-Abuja highway, but now because of the presence of troops there, kidnapping and banditry have moved to Kaduna-Kachia-Kafanchan axis,\u201dshe said.\n\nShe added that increased military presence was also required in Igabi, Chikun, Giwa and Kajuru Local Government Area of the state.\n\nWhile commending the military for the operations, she also called for a more coordinated approach to tackle the bandits, noting that once security forces were in a particular area, the bandits moved to other areas.\n\nShe , therefore, called on the Nigerian Army to consider deploying more troops to the Southern Kaduna general area, especially, Zangon Kataf LGA, following the recent crisis in the area, which has led to destruction of lives and property.\n\nShe applauded the leadership of the Operation Safe Haven in trying to secure the Southern part of the state.\n\n\u201cWe have had relative peace until recently, when the crisis in Zangon Kataf started again and we feel that we should have more troops deployed there because it\u2019s like the situation is overwhelming,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier, Yahaya, who said he was in Kaduna for Senior Officers Seminar, commended the state government for the support being given to the Army.\n\n\u201cI would like to particularly appreciate His Excellency, the Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, for all the support we enjoy from him and from the Government of Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cI was here as the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 1 Division, I know how we related.\u201d he said.\n\nYahaya contended that the Nigerian Army was aware of the security challenges in Kaduna and assured the people and government that everything would be done to flush out the criminals, adding that troops had started taking the battle to the bandits.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Segun James and Wale Igbintade\n\nTwelve years after a legal luminary of global reckoning, Chief Gani Fawehinmi passed, his scion, Mohammed, died last night of complications from Covid-19.\n\nMohammed reportedly died at a private hospital yesterday and the Minister of State for Niger Delta, Mr. Festus Keyamo, has confirmed the news.\n\nAlthough some other sources claimed Mohammed died of an undisclosed ailment at a private hospital in Lagos, THISDAY however confirmed he died of complications arising from Covid-19.\n\nTHISDAY also has reasons to believe he might have died at a government facility in Lagos State.\n\nBut the family was yet to make a statement on his death as at the time of filing this report.\n\nA reliable source at a government health facility, who confirmed he died of Covid-19 complications, told THISDAY that, \u201cWe have been managing him since morning, but unfortunately, he passed on. Yes, he died of Covid-19,\u201d suggesting he died at a government hospital.\n\nKeyamo, though confirmed the news without stating the cause and where he died, hadworked with the late Mohammed at the Fawehinmi chambers for many years.\n\nIn a statement, the junior minister lamented: \u201cMy brother, friend and son of my late boss, Mohammed Fawehinmi, is gone. I am speechless and heartbroken. I just spoke with the eldest daughter, Basirat and she confirmed it,\u201d said Keyamo.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMohammed was energetic and very intellectually alert, despite his mishap. He kept the flame of his father burning. We will sorely miss him.\u201d\n\nMohammed lost his ability to walk after a terrible auto accident in 2003. A graduate of Business Administration at the University of Lagos, before he ventured into law practice, he obtained an LLB degree from the University of Buckingham, England, and was called to Nigerian Bar in 1998. He has over 20 years of experience in the practice of law.\n\nUntil his death, he was the Head of Gani Fawehinmi\u2019s Chambers, Director, Nigerian Law Publications Limited, Director, Books Industries Nigeria Limited and Director, Gani Fawehinmi Library & Gallery Limited.\n\nMohammed once described growing up under his father as a military camp. \u201cIt was like growing up in a military camp. He gave the order, and you must comply. You failed to do so and you got thoroughly punished. I particularly have been displaced with any sort of rod that you can imagine.\n\n\u201cUntil the anger in him calmed, he would not stop punishing you. The only time you would offend my father and he let you walk away was whenever he sighted his mother. No matter your offence, he would not punish you once she was there. Being the first child, my father made sure he disciplined me the most.\u201d\n\nMohammed\u2019s greatest ambition was to be an army officer, a move that his father rejected.\n\n\u201cI wanted to become an army general. I had three uncles in the army. Two of them were captains while one was a major. I loved the uniform and personality of military men, being like them was just what I wanted for myself.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 14, we were given forms in school for the Nigerian Defence Academy. I hurriedly filled mine and took it to my father for him to sign; I never knew I had courted trouble. Till he died, I don\u2019t think he had ever been that angry. He said I wanted to go and join the people that were throwing him in jail all the time. He said I wanted to join those,who wanted to kill him. He said it was better he killed me before I joined his enemies.\n\n\u201cIt took four senior lawyers to hold him down that day. One of them was OAR Ogunde, a senior advocate, Mr. Tayo Oyetibo, Mike Philips and one other person. I had to run away from the scene as fast as I could and managed to jump the fence before tearing the form. I thought he had forgotten about everything but I was surprised when he woke me up with the cane at about 2:30 am the next morning. He dealt with me thoroughly that day.\n\n\u201cLater in life, I wanted to become a business administrator even though the desire to become a military man never left me. When I went to England to study law after my first degree in Business Administration from the University of Lagos, I met a military general, who further aroused my interest in the profession.\n\n\u201cBut immediately after I finished my studies, my father was on my neck to return to Nigeria to attend law school. For a while, that interest waned in me but whenever I come across a military cantonment and I see the way the officers move, I feel like being a part of them,\u201d he said.\n\nHis father, Gani Fawehinmi, who was one of Nigeria\u2019s most iconic legal minds, died on September 5, 2009.\n\nIn an interview he granted before his death, he said, \u201cI just felt that I shouldn\u2019t bother any woman with my condition. I didn\u2019t want anybody to marry me out of pity. Even though I always have females around me, it is not every woman that can stay with a person with disability of my kind.\n\n\u201cMost of the women I have met in recent times are not the ones that can stay with a man, they are the type who would want to attend parties and keep all sorts of friends instead of looking after me. Of course, a few have come close to what I want but the temperament is nothing to write home about\u201d.\n\nSpeaking about the challenge of practicing law while on a wheelchair, Mohammed said: I look at my ordeal as part of life\u2019s \u2018buffet\u2019, just like it served my late father on several occasions. I feel I\u2019m in a mini detention centre at the moment, but then, I\u2019m positive that one day, I\u2019ll be free. But I\u2019m glad that I have been able to practice as a trained lawyer despite the tragedy that I\u2019ve encountered in life.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer and rights activist, Dr Kayode Ajulo, has expressed sadness at the death of Mohammed Fawehinmi.\n\nAjulo described him as a comrade and brother who would be missed.\n\nHe said that Mohammed stayed on course until death.Ajulo prayed God to give succour to Mohammed\u2019s family.\n\nAlso, The Centre for Human and Socioeconomic Rights, said demise of Mohammed Fawehinmi, was a terrible loss.\n\nNational President of the group, Mr. Alex Omotehinse, stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) while reacting to the death of the lawyer.\n\nOmotehinse said the news was a rude shock.\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that among the children of the late legal icon, Mohammed was the only one who identified with us and remained with us, despite the challenges he faced.\n\n\u201cMohammed stood with us in the struggle to defend the masses.\n\n\u201cNow that he has again dropped the baton, a very big vacuum has been created,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the death of Mohammed Fawehinmi, implies that Gani Fawehinmi\u2019s household may be finally missed in the activism circle.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is only Mohammed that carried the mantle, despite his health challenges.\n\n\u201cWhen some of us see him, we believe Gani was still alive, because he was bold, spoke like his father, he was courageous and never looked at his challenges.\n\nThe rights activist recalled how civil society groups, alongside Mohammed, attended the burial of late Mr. Yinka Odumakin, another activist, who died recently.\n\nHe added that the late younger Fawehinmi, also joined them recently, during a courtesy visit to the residence of another late activist, Mr. Innocent Chukwuma .\n\nOmotehinse said the death was a huge loss and very sad one, praying God to console the late Mohammed\u2019s mother and family.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "\"The Bags Belong To The Governor\"\u2014Power-Drunk Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, Aides Breach Airport Security Procedure, Refuse To Be Screened To Board Flight",
          "text": "The Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, on Wednesday, violated the airport security procedures, particularly at airport security checkpoints at the Terminal 2 of the Murtala Muhammed Domestic Airport in Lagos.\n\nEyewitnesses told SaharaReporters that the governor and his aides treated the airport security rules and procedures with disdain.\n\nThe governor had arrived at the airport for the inaugural flight of United Nigeria Airlines to Bayelsa International Airport.\n\nUpon arrival at the airport around 12pm, the governor and his aides headed for the screening points where they displayed outright disregard for the rules at the airport which triggered the security alarm system, sources said.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, a passenger who witnessed the incident said, \u201cThe airport security officials did everything to get them to undergo the procedure at the security checkpoint but they refused to put their bags through the screening x-ray machine.\n\n\u201cThey kept saying the bags belonged to the governor and they all forced their way through the checkpoint.

          "text": "Rebecca Enonchong, one of Africa\u2019s most prominent tech entrepreneurs, is reportedly set to appear before a court in her home country, Cameroon, on Thursday after she was arrested on Tuesday, August 10.\n\nThis is according to Edith Kah Walla, the leader of the Cameroon People\u2019s Party (CPP).\n\nWalla had earlier revealed in a series of tweets that the Cameroonian entrepreneur had been arrested and was being held at the Gendarmerie Legion (a police station) in Douala, apparently by government order and without any arrest warrant.\n\nAccording to Walla, the United States-based Enonchong was called to the Gendarmerie for a case involving her family.\n\nWhile meeting with the Attorney General (Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), she reportedly asked that her cases be handled by one investigator rather than two. The request was considered an \u201coutrage \u00e0 magistrat\u201d (contempt of court) by the AG, who ordered her immediate arrest.\n\nHello All!\n\n\n\n1st, Congrats for amazing mobilization today.\n\n2nd, stay mobilized. @africatechie is still under arrest. She will sadly spend another night at the Gendarmerie Legion.\n\n\n\nAafter 4 hours of ping-pong between the Magistrate, the Attorney General & the Legion Commander. \u2014 Kah Walla (@KahWalla) August 11, 2021\n\nEnonchong remains in police custody and has been scheduled to appear at the Bonanjo Court of First Instance, Douala, on Thursday morning.\n\nOutpouring of support\n\nThere\u2019s been a flux of support at home and abroad for the Cameroonian entrepreneur since reports of the arrest \u2013 which has been described as unlawful, illegal, and an abuse of power \u2013 surfaced.\n\nEnonchong\u2019s detention has sparked outrage online with many individuals and organisations calling on the government to restore her freedom, in a country where such arbitrary detentions aren\u2019t uncommon.\n\nThe hashtag #FreeRebecca has gone viral on social media and an initiative, FreeRebecca.com has been launched to protest against the arrest.\n\nA statement issued by the African Business Angels Network (ABAN) described the action of the Cameroonian government as \u201chighly irresponsible.\u201d The network of early-stage startup investors was co-founded by Enonchong, who serves as a Board Member and Trustee of the organisation.\n\nWe have seen Rebecca at the Gendarmerie.\n\nShe is in good health & excellent spirits.\n\nKeep retweeting #FreeRebecca.\n\nMake as much noise as possible.\n\nShe is being held with no written complaint.\n\n\n\nThe Attorney General verbally requested her arrest for \"outrage\" against himself! https://t.co/8FxfOLSxlq \u2014 Kah Walla (@KahWalla) August 11, 2021\n\nWho is Rebecca Enonchong?\n\nThe 54-year-old Enonchong is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of AppsTech, a global provider of enterprise software solutions, which she launched in 1999.\n\nEnonchong is also the co-founder of I/O Spaces, ABAN, and Cameroon Angels Network. She sits on the boards of many corporations including AfriLabs Foundation, ActivSpaces, Digital Africa, WHO Foundation, Eneza Education, Suguba, Djibouti Telecom, US Exim SAAC, and the UNECA Center for Digital Excellence.\n\nEnonchong is an advisor to Venture Capital for Africa (VC4Africa), the largest online community dedicated to entrepreneurs and investors building African companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn 2017, she was named as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans in Science, Tech & Innovation by the New African Magazine and Jeune Afrique\u2019s 50 Most Influential Africans.

          "title": "Beyond funding, MAGIC Fund\u2019s value-add helps early-stage founders scale",
          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

We are doing enumeration and biometric data capturing of the pupils enrolled under the programme, getting feedbacks from cooks and head-teachers within the programme.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep an up-to-date record of the programme and make it more responsive as well as meet the beneficiaries to get real-time feedback from them as well.\n\n\u201cThe current enumeration and bio-data capturing is a building block towards the expansion of the programme to include more pupils and schools in the state.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari had earlier announced his laudable intention of an additional 5 million pupils to be enrolled in the programme nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe ministry also wants to know how the programme is being managed on daily basis, the resources available and if there are shortfalls before the expansion would be done in order to tighten loose ends,\u201d she said.\n\nThe minister said that the programme, which started on Feb. 8, 2017, in the state, had pushed up enrollment figures in public schools and increased the daily attendance to school.\n\n\u201cThe programme has helped in the concentration of the pupils during classes since some of them do not feed or are underfed at home before coming to school each day,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nFarouq said that currently, the programme is having 9,196,823 pupils nationwide, with a total of 107,000 cooks supplying the food, which is indigenous and home-made for the pupils nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe programme has a lot of multiplier effects. It has assisted farmers to expand food production and employ more hands in the farms as well as the cooks also employing more hands to assist them,\u2019\u2019 she noted.\n\nSpeaking, the Headmistress of the primary school, Mrs Salome Obi, said that the pupils were \u2018very happy\u2019 to be part of the programme, adding that apart from increasing enrollment, \u201cit has helped in pupils\u2019 retention ability\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter eating the meals each day, you see the pupils enlivened and eager to continue with their learning rather than feeling dull or hungry,\u2019\u2019 Obi said.\n\nA cook in the programme, Mrs Uzoamaka Ogbu, thanked the Federal Government for engaging her and other women in the programme, which had helped to improve the welfare of their families and other dependents.\n\n\u201cThe challenge we are having is the issue of non-regular payment and the current cost of food stuff in the market, which the N70 per meal (with a fruit) remained inadequate with market realities,\u2019\u2019 Ogbu said.\n\nA pupil, Miss Flavour Anigbo, prayed God to bless and protect President Buhari for providing food for her and her classmates.\n\n\u201cThe feeding makes us happy each day in school. We want them to keep it up and God to bless President Muhammadu Buhari for us,\u2019\u2019 Anigbo said.\n\nThe ministry monitoring and enumerating team later went to a primary school complex within Idaw River area in Enugu South Local Government with five primary schools.\n\n...",

But in 2015 the oil marketers recovered N1.6 billion more than was required, the audit report noted.\n\nOver a year after the money was overpaid to the marketers, the PPPRA did not recover it, contrary to usual practice in the industry, the auditors noted\n\nThis is contained in the in the annual report of the Auditor-General of the Federation (AuGF) for 2015.\n\nThe report was submitted to the Senate by its Committee on Public Account in June.\n\nThe PPPRA is part of the 114 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) indicted and queried by the auditor-general for incessant violation of extant rules, some of which include non-retirement of personal advances within a financial year and grant of cash advances above approved limit.\n\nIn the report obtained by PREMIUM TIMES, all 114 MDAs were queried by the auditor-general. About 84 responded, made submissions and appeared before the Senate panel to defend the queries raised. Another 21 MDAs sent in written reports but did not appear before the committee.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how seven MDAs including the Ministries of Information, Police and Health, refused to appear before the Senate Committee.\n\nThis paper also reported how the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) was queried by the Senate for spending N995 million on \u201cstore items\u201d and paying salaries to dead officers.\n\nThe Query\n\nAlthough the names of the oil marketers involved were not mentioned in the report, the auditor-general stated that they were overpaid and required to explain the non-collection of the over-recovered amount.\n\n\u201cThe practice has been that Oil Marketers will pay for the product and later recover their money from the federal government (through PPPRA). In the case under review, the Oil Marketers over recovered what was due to them by N1,596,803,859.97 and that amounted to over payment to the marketers.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Management of PPPRA is required to provide explanation for the non-collection of the \u201cover recovered amount\u201d by the Oil Marketers for over two years since this occurred and show evidence of the recovery of N1,596,803,859.97 outstanding amount from the Oil Marketers and forward to the Auditor-General for the Federation for appropriate verification,\u201d part of the report read.\n\nHowever, in its response, the PPPRA stated that \u201cover recovery\u201d under the Petroleum Support Fund (PSF) scheme was the period at which the PPPRA\u2019s recommended ex-depot price was higher than the landing cost of products.\n\n\u201cMarketers were therefore required to pay back the differentials between the landing cost and the ex-depot price to the government. On the other hand, \u201cunder recovery\u201d was when the recommended ex-depot price was lower than the landing cost of products.\n\n\u201cIn this case, marketers were reimbursed by the government with the differentials (subsidy).\u201d\n\nThe agency further explained that in 2015, the PSF scheme experienced a brief period of over recovery for which the sum of N1,576,382,310.61 was computed.\n\nMarketers, they said, were duly advised and the sum of N938,933,616.17 recovered and paid into the PSF Account domiciled with the CBN.\n\n\u201cThe delay in full recovery of the \u2018over recovery\u2019 was due to the marketers\u2019 insistence of settlement or of netting-off on their long outstanding claims (Subsidy, Interest charges and Foreign Exchange Differentials) with Government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, the total over-recovery is N1,576,382,310.61 as against N1,596,803,859.97 reported and that over-recovery is not overpayment to the OMCs as stated in the report,\u201d the PPPRA said in its response.\n\nBut the Senate Committee chaired by Matthew Urhoghide (PDP, Edo), observed that the PPPRA was not diligent and proactive on what it termed \u2018over recovery\u2019 under the PSF Scheme.\n\nIt, therefore, recommended that the agency recover the outstanding sum of N1.6 billion from the indebted oil marketers within six months and forward the recovery particulars to the auditor-general for audit and also to the committee for its note.\n\nMore discrepancies in other MDAs\n\nApart from frivolous spendings, failure to recover necessary funds and payment of salaries to dead officers, many other MDAs flouted key rules which, according to the report, required urgent parliamentary and executive attention to enable easier audit process.\n\nSome of the violations include consistent contravention of relevant constitutional provisions and other extant laws by the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation and late submission of the Annual Financial Statement \u2013 a violation of the provisions of Section 49 (1) and (2) of Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007 and Section 85 (5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe panel also said the executive withdrew funds from Special Fund Accounts for purposes other than the objectives the funds were created, and without recourse to the National Assembly for authorisation \u2013 contrary to Section 80 (4) of the Constitution.\n\nThe lawmakers noted the lack of collaboration between the two key agencies involved in the management and review of public funds; that is, the Office of the auditor-general and the Office of the accountant-general.\n\nThey said such attitude of lack of cooperation between the offices, constitutes a barrier to efficient, effective, economic and transparent audit process of the nation\u2019s federation account and thus gives room for negative corruption perception index, thereby rubbishing government efforts in fighting grafts in the society.\n\nThe committee also discovered the prevalence of unwholesome financial practices by some principal revenue agencies which, it said, have negative implications on the revenue generation efforts of the government.\n\nThey faulted the deliberate delay in the submission of financial transcripts by the Accountant-General of the Federation to the Auditor-General for the Federation \u2013 describing it as a conscious effort at undermining the Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation and by extension, the supreme law of the land.\n\nEmpty threats\n\nAlthough recommendations were made and some agencies were given a timeframe to correct the issues they were queried about, this is not the first time.\n\nThe Senate, especially its Public Accounts Committee, is known for issuing threats to heads of MDAs over one discrepancy or the other, but not much is done to carry out these threats.\n\nThe panel in February 2020, threatened to demand the sack of heads of agencies like Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), among others.\n\nIn June of the same year, it threatened to order the arrest of the ministers of information, petroleum resources, power, women Affairs, solid minerals and the head of the National Population Commission (NPC) for failing to appear before it.\n\nApart from the committee, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, had also vowed to publish the names of the MDAs that failed to respond to the queries and account for public funds. However, two months later, nothing has been done to that regard.\n\nOne of the major recommendations by the committee is the passage of the Audit Service Bill into law which the panel said, will help strengthen and streamline the audit process with a view to ensuring prudence in public finance and transactions.",
          "summary": "Although the state oil company, NNPC, is now the main importer of petrol in Nigeria, oil marketers used to import petroleum products with their funds and recover their money afterwards, through the PPPRA.\nBut in 2015 the oil marketers recovered N1.6 billion more than was required, the audit report noted.\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how seven MDAs including the Ministries of Information, Police and Health, refused to appear before the Senate Committee.\n\u201cThe practice has been that Oil Marketers will pay for the product and later recover their money from the federal government (through PPPRA).\nIn the case under review, the Oil Marketers over recovered what was due to them by N1,596,803,859.97 and that amounted to over payment to the marketers.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the sum of $2,541,689 and N498,230,281 for four projects in the Ministry of Power.\n\nThe Minister of Power, Saleh Mamman, stated this while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the First Lady\u2019s Conference Room, Presidential Villa, Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nThe Minister said: \u201cThe Federal Ministry of Power also received the blessing of the Federal Executive Council by giving four approvals for our contracts. One is the supply and installation of motorised portable hydraulic compressor for the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, in favour of Messrs Intern Equipment Nigeria Limited in the sum of US$502,950 plus N15,800,000.\n\n\u201cThe second approval was also received for the award of the contract for the supply and delivery of three sets of online partial discharge measurement and monitoring equipment for the TCN in favour of Messrs T and D Technology Limited in the sum of US$ 874,800 offshore plus N240,100,000 onshore with a delivery period of nine months.\n\n\u201cThe third approval was the award of the contract for the repairs of 100 MVA and four sets of 60 MVA 132 33 power transformers for TCN in favour of GT Engineering Limited in the sum of US$ 661,220 offshore and N127,758,781 onshore with a delivery period of 12 months.\n\n\u201cOn the last one, approval was also granted for the contract for procurement of 10 sets of 330 KV and 30 sets of 133 KV circuit breaker for the TCN in favour of Horsepower Engineering Trading Limited in the sum of US$ 502,719 plus N114,571,500 with a delivery period of six months.\u201d\n\nIn his own briefing, the Minister of Environment Muhammed Mahmood, said the Council ratified an anticipatory approval received from President Muhammadu Buhari on the nation\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which is part of its commitment to the climate change pact.\n\nThe Minister noted that the contribution, which saw Nigeria agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emission by 20 percent as at last year and by 45 percent in 2030, adding that part of the obligations to the signatories of the agreement is the revision of the progress and the submission of an interim report every five years.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Environment presented a memo today, seeking for the ratification of an anticipatory approval that we received from Mr. President, on the submission of our primary NDC, that is the Nationally Determined Contribution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the commitment that Nigeria made in 2016 during the Paris Agreement; that every country, after five years, will revise the commitment the country made in cutting down emission.\n\n\u2018\u2019So, at the time we committed to reducing emission by 20 percent, unconditionally, meaning we can do it by ourselves. That\u2019s by 2020. The 20 percent is by the year 2020. At the same time, we are also committed to reducing 45% by 2030. That\u2019s again from the year 2016.\n\n\u201cSo, we did the first the interim report, a country is supposed to send in an interim report to the United Nations Climate Change desk, and then before July 31, you\u2019ll now submit the final report.\n\n\u2018\u2019We have done that and part of this reporting is again, for every country, doing that will put the country on a good footing as far as climate change action is concerned and this has a number of sectors that we depended on to be able to reach this: Power, Agriculture, Transportation.\n\n\u201cThese are areas that we used as part of attending to that commitment that we made and today, we have gotten the approval of the ratification following that statutory approval by Mr. President. So, Nigeria is currently in good standing, as about 100 countries have already submitted and Nigeria is one of those,\u201d he explained.\n\nAsked if Nigeria achieved the 20 percent emission cut as at last year, Mahmood said \u201cyes, we have. Since the ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2016 and even before then, government has put in a number of interventions to deal with the issue of climate change. You see, climate change did not just start in 2016. 2016 happened to be just like the culmination of the problem that showed and there\u2019s need for an immediate action on climate change.\n\n\u201cSo, the government rolled out a number of things and this was even before I became a minister and we have done so much, I can give you an example. That was when we started the issuance of green bond and bond issuance is to generate money, solely for green projects.\n\n\u201cBased on our calculations, we have met that 20 percent last year, in fact, I can even say we have surpassed that. That\u2019s why we took that as unconditional, it\u2019s something that we know already we can.\u201d",

Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi and Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, the group reported that a technical audit in 2016 identified 116 inherited projects for priority completion which included 37 Dams and Reservoirs, 41 Water Supply Projects, 38 Irrigation and Drainage Projects.\n\nThe statement explained that since 2016, twelve (12) Dams have been completed by the Buhari Administration spread across eleven (11) States.\n\nThe group listed the completed dams as Kashimbila Multipurpose Dam, Taraba; Ogwashi-Uku Multipurpose Dam, Delta; Adada Dam, Enugu; Sulma Earth Dam, Katsina; Gimi Earth Dam, Kaduna; Amla-Otukpo Dam, Benue; Amauzari Earth Dam, Imo; Ibiono-Ibom Earth Dam, Akwa Ibom; Gadau/Lafia Zigau Dam, Bauchi; Alajue Small Earth Dam, Osun; Kampe Omi Dam, Kogi (Rehabilitation) and Kargo Dam, Kaduna (Rehabilitation).\n\nIt added that another eight (8) dam projects, eight (8) hydropower projects, sixteen (16) irrigation projects, and eleven (11) Water Supply Projects are scheduled for completion by 2023.\n\nThe statement further explained that three (3) Hydropower Projects have also been completed, as follows: Gurara Hydropower Project, 30MW, Kaduna State \u2013 completed and concessioned in 2020; Kashimbila Hydropower Project, 40MW, Taraba, now ready for concessions; and the Dadin-Kowa Hydropower Project, 40MW, Gombe, which has been completed, and is now feeding into the National Grid.\n\n\u201cIn the area of irrigation, seven (7) projects have been fully completed, with another two partly completed (sectoral completion). In addition, thirty (30) of the forty-one (41) priority Water Supply Projects inherited by the Administration have now been completed; the very first one to be completed being the Central Ogbia Regional Water Supply Project in Bayelsa State, in September 2016, and the most recent being the Zobe and Kazaure Water Supply Projects in Katsina and Jigawa States, in July 2021.\n\n\u201cThe River Basin Development Authorities (RBDAs) are being revitalized under the Buhari Administration, to enable them fully serve the purpose for which they were established. These RBDAs have collectively built 42 small dams in their catchment areas, and efforts are on to collaborate with State Governments to fully utilize these dams. The RBDAs have also leased 253 farmlands to the private sector for commercial agriculture, according to the Ministry of Water Resources; 181 of these farmlands are already being fully utilized. Partial Commercialization has also commenced at four of the RBDAs, as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to ensure greater private sector involvement in the management and utilization of national infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIn the area of Sanitation, President Buhari signed Executive Order 9 on November 20, 2019, in support of the Administration\u2019s efforts to end Open Defecation across the country.

          "text": "Lagos State government has debunked claims in some media reports that it has taken over Lekki Concession Company, describing the information as untrue.\n\nThe state government in a statement issued by its commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, noted that reports that the Lagos State House of Assembly had granted the state government the go-ahead to take over the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) were wrong.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe government did not make such a request. Its request was to convert the African Development Bank loan from a private sector (commercial) loan to a sovereign (public sector) loan, which attracts a lower interest rate. This will enable the company to make some savings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe government, in fact, acquired the full shares/equity of the former owners of the company in 2014. There was no need to take such a request to the House.\n\n\u201cFollowing the Lagos State Government\u2019s full ownership of LCC in December 2014, the loan became eligible for conversion to a sovereign facility with an attendant significant lower interest rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points and extended tenor.\n\n\u201cIn the recent past, there have been discussions amongst LCC/LASG, AfDB and the relevant federal government ministries and agencies concerning conversion of the loan to a sovereign facility. Upon the completion of the conversion, there will be a significant reduction of applicable interest rate and extended tenor.\n\n\u201cThe sovereign loan conversion will also lead to a crash of the applicable interest rate on the facility to circa 1.8%pa compared to the current interest rate of circa 4.12% p.a. Besides, the conversion will increase the tenor of the facility from the current five years to 15 years. This has the impact of spreading the cash flow impact by an additional 10 years.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, one of the requirements stipulated by the Federal Ministry of Finance for the loan conversion is the approval of the Lagos State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is the approval given by the Lagos State House of Assembly on 5th August, and not an approval for taking over of LCC, as reported. As stated earlier, LASG took over the shares of the previous private shareholders of the company in December, 2014.\n\n\u201cLekki Concession Company Limited (\u201cLCC\u201d) is a Special Purpose Vehicle set up specifically to execute the Eti-Osa/Lekki-Epe Toll Road Concession Project. The project is designed to deliver essential road infrastructure and services along the Lekki Peninsular of Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe Lekki Toll Road Concession was conceptualized as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme, and uses the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model of Infrastructure delivery. The Concession is for 30 years, following which the assets will be transferred to the Lagos State Government.\n\n\u2018\u2019The project, given its pioneering nature, had some underlying assumptions and market indicators upon which the transaction was concluded and which have since drastically changed in a manner that can no longer be sustained in its previous form. The initial financial model contemplated three (3) Toll Plazas. This is the basis for the initial lending and repayment in the Model. Given the non-tolling of the Conservation Toll Plaza (around Chevron) and the complete cancellation of the third Toll Plaza (proposed to be located around the Lagos Business School), the financial sustainability of the project suffered a setback.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "Usman Ogar, the Nigerian High Commissioner to Indonesia, and Abdulrrahman Ibrahim, a diplomat who was assaulted by immigration agents in the Southeast Asian country, will arrive today.\n\nAccording to The PUNCH, the Indonesian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Dr Usra Harahap, told the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, in Abuja on Wednesday that the Nigerian diplomat was the aggressor during his (Ibrahim\u2019s) confrontation with some immigration authorities.\n\nIbrahim was assaulted in a car by some Indonesian immigration authorities in Jakarta, according to the PUNCH.\n\nThe event on August 7 caused a diplomatic spat between Nigeria and Indonesia, with the Federal Government recalling Ogar for consultation and threatening a review of the two countries\u2019 bilateral relations.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government will make its stance public after speaking with the recalled Nigerian envoy scheduled to arrive in the nation along with Ibrahim on Thursday (today),\u201d said Mrs Esther Sunsuwa, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with The PUNCH on Wednesday.\n\nRecall that the minister summoned Harahap on Monday in connection with the assassination of a Nigerian diplomat in Jakarta.\n\nOn Wednesday, our correspondent got a copy of the Indonesian envoy\u2019s Monday presentation to Onyeama.\n\nAccording to the envoy\u2019s account of the incident, immigration authorities from the South Jakarta Immigration Office were conducting surveillance on foreigners when they requested Ibrahim for identification, but the diplomat allegedly refused to identify himself or produce his passport.\n\nHe stated \u201cBy that time, they met with Mr Ibrahim, and politely requested him to show his travel document. He answered that his passport was in his room.\n\n\u201cThen the officer asked again, \u2018Can we see your travel document to check the residence permit and if there are no problems with the document, so you may continue your activities\n\n\u201cMr Ibrahim was not willing to show his passport and said to the officer, \u2018you will know who really I am and be careful on that.\n\n\u201cInstead of showing his identity card, Mr Ibrahim was angry and said, \u2018Just arrest me and you will regret to know who really I am.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe officer said, \u2018We will not detain you further sir, if you can show us your identity card.\u2019 Then Mr Ibrahim said, \u2018Where is your car, I\u2019ll come to your office.\u2019\n\n\u201cOn the way to the immigration office in South Jakarta, several incidents happened. Mr Ibrahim elbowed the immigration officer, Mr Laode Hauzan Baidi, who was sitting next to him until Mr Laode\u2019s lip was bleeding.\n\n\u201cThis led to other officers restraining him from attacking another officer during the trip.\u201d\n\nExplaining that Ibrahim later showed his identity card, Harahap further said, \u201cAs of February 22, 2021, there were 180 Nigerian citizens in Indonesian Immigration Detention Centre, who were undergoing process for deportation.\u201d\n\nThe envoy further said that the issue was resolved when the Nigerian high commissioner to Indonesia arrived at the South Jakarta Immigration Office around 6:30 pm, together with the staff and his police guard from the Directorate of Security of Vital Objects of Police of the Greater Jakarta Metro Area\n\nHe stated that the officer injured by Ibrahim lodged a complaint about the attack on him but did not process it further because the matter had been resolved.\n\nWhen our correspondent asked if Indonesia would sanction the officials involved in the incident as demanded by Onyeama, the spokesman for the Indonesian High Commission in Nigeria, Mr Zaenur Rofid, said investigation into the incident was still ongoing.\n\nForeign relations professionals laud FG, say Indonesian officials must be sacked\n\nMeanwhile, the Association of Foreign Relations Professionals of Nigeria has commended the recall of the Nigerian high commissioner to Indonesia by the FG.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday titled, \u2018Undiplomatic and uncivilized treatment of a Nigerian diplomat in Indonesia\u2019, AFRPN President, Amb Gani Lawal, called for the sacking of the immigration officials.\n\n\n\nThe association comprising serving and retired ambassadors asked the Indonesian high commissioner to return to Jakarta \u201cuntil satisfactory explanation and necessary restitutive steps are taken by Indonesian authorities to assuage frayed nerves.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Association of Retired Career Ambassadors of Nigeria condemned the attack by the Indonesian officials on the diplomatic agent.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe actions of the Indonesian officials represent a modern-day display of gangsterism and inhuman behaviour towards a fellow human being, even if he was not a diplomatic agent, and must therefore be met with robust response from the Federal Government of Nigeria through the application of measures that may include a complete reassessment of Nigeria\u2019s diplomatic relations with Indonesia.\n\n\u201cARCAN rejects the statement credited to the Head of the Regional Office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of Indonesia which makes no sense and an obvious attempt to cover up the barbaric action of the Immigration officials, and a clear indication of the unacceptable manner foreigners, legal or illegal, are treated in the country.\u201d",

Akeredolu, with persons who should know better, coming out with very malicious and self-serving opinions, just to play on the gullibility of the public, while forgetting that our party is made up of very intelligent, sound and intellectually proficient persons who have seen beneath their grandstanding.\n\n\u201cThe majority judgment of the Supreme Court has strengthened the position of the CECPC and our Chairman. The minority judgment serves only for academic purposes, nothing more.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General of the federation who is the chief law officer of the federation has stated that we are on firm ground and advised that we proceed with the processes of the Congresses.\n\n\u201cThe Progressive Governors Forum through their extensive legal apparatchik have x-rayed the generality of the issue in their meeting of 8/8/2021 and have re-affirmed their support to the CECPC and urged the CECPC to proceed with the Congresses as scheduled.\n\n\u201cIt is trite to note that, the Congresses to produce our party organs across had commenced on the 31st of July, 2021 and you will agree with me that it went substantially well.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is expected that where ever and whenever there\u2019s a competition, of course, there is bound to be contestations.\n\n\u201cTherefore as an organization based on rules and procedures, avenues and channels must be provided for party members who are dissatisfied with the processes, to ventilate their grievances through an internal mechanism, hence this Wards Congresses Appeals Committee in the circumstance of this exercise.\n\n\u201cThis party is for all Nigerians, therefore we must show, not only by words, but by concrete actions that there\u2019s no attempt to exclude or sideline anybody in the course of the exercise. This is very fundamental, not only to the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, but to the preservation of the very essence of the party.\n\n\u201cYour actions in this wise will help engender cohesion, build trust and confidence in this all important exercise.\n\n\u201cToday, you have been entrusted with one of the most solemn obligations of citizenship which is to help deepen our democratisation processes and strengthen the polity.\n\n\u201cYou all were carefully selected based on your proven records. We trust in your strength of character, your integrity and your capacity to be fair in your dealings to those who approach your committees.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman had directed that I remind all party members that this is a family affair, hence differences should be handled with the understanding that no dispute is worth the destruction of the house you jointly erected.\u201d\n\nLeave me out of APC crisis \u2013 Oshiomhole\n\nMeanwhile, former APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has denied plotting to return to office, and asked not to be dragged into the party crisis in whatever form.\n\nThe former party chair said this Wednesday in a statement by his media aide, Victor Oshioke, in Abuja.\n\nHe reaffirmed his loyalty to the APC under the leadership of Governor Mai-Mala Buni.\n\nOshiomhole said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a statement credited to Chief Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, a former National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who is now a member of the APC and self-styled aide of Minister of Transportation, Chief Rotimi Amaechi.\n\n\u201cIn the said statement widely reported in the media, Chief Eze was quoted as saying that Mr. Festus Keyamo SAN, Hon. Minister of State for Labour and Employment and others were plotting to bring back Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as national chairman of the APC.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily we would have ignored this nonsensical suggestion. However, it is pertinent to set the records straight and put to rest this ridiculous falsehood being marketed by Eze Chukwuemeka Eze.\u201d\n\nThe former Edo state governor also said Keyamo was in the forefront and provided legal support in court for his removal.\n\n\u201cKeyamo also offered legal advice on the legality of the NEC that was convened for the dissolution of the Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee of APC and emergence of the Governor Mai-Mala Buni led Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore frivolous for any right-thinking person to assume that Keyamo who actively supported the removal of the National chairman elected by over 6, 500 party delegates from across the 36 states and the FCT because 8 out of 27 Ward executive members purportedly suspended a national party chairman, would now plot to bring the same Oshiomhole back to the office,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOshiomhole said he won\u2019t be part of any plot to destabilise or ridicule the APC for whatever reason.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to further reaffirm Comrade Adams Oshiomhole\u2019s loyalty to the APC under the able leadership of His Excellency, Governor Mai-Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cOshiomhole\u2019s position is that all hands should be on deck to support the Governor Mai-Mala Buni led Caretaker Committee to complete its assignment rather than creating distractions that are counterproductive to the mandate of the committee.\n\n\u201cHe congratulates Governor Mai Mala Buni and the entire members of the Caretaker Committee for their efforts in depleting the ranks of Governors of the PDP by winning three of them into the APC fold,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Australia\u2019s capital Canberra has announced a snap one-week lockdown after reporting its first locally acquired case of COVID-19 in more than a year.\n\nThe restrictions, which will take effect on Thursday evening, come as Australia battles to control the highly infectious Delta strain of the coronavirus. More than 10 million people in the country\u2019s biggest cities, Melbourne and Sydney, are already under hard lockdowns.\n\nAndrew Barr, the chief minister of the Australian Capital Territory, which encompasses Canberra, said the source of the positive case in the city was not yet clear.\n\n\u201cThis is the most serious public health risk we have faced in the territory this year,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt is why we are introducing a strict lockdown in response.\u201d\n\nUnder the restrictions, face masks must be worn by everyone aged 12 and over outside their homes and people can only leave their homes for essential reasons, including shopping, healthcare and exercise.\n\nNon-essential businesses must also close for the duration of the lockdown.\n\nYear 12 HSC students begin to get their Pfizer vaccines for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at a mass vaccination hub at Sydney Olympic Park in Sydney, Australia, August 9, 2021 [Dean Lewis/Pool via Reuters]\n\nIn Sydney, the government of the state of New South Wales (NSW) said it might call in more military personnel to ensure compliance with COVID-19 restrictions as daily cases remained at record highs despite seven weeks of lockdown.\n\n\u201cWe are making sure that we do not leave any stone unturned in relation to extra (military) resources,\u201d NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said at a news conference in Sydney, the state capital and Australia\u2019s biggest city.\n\nA spokesperson for Defence Minister Peter Dutton told the Reuters news agency the NSW government has indicated it would soon formally request additional military support. Some 580 unarmed army personnel are already helping police enforce home-quarantine orders on affected households in Sydney\u2019s worst-affected western suburbs.\n\nSeveral regional towns scattered across NSW have also been forced into snap lockdowns after fresh cases, raising fears the virus is spreading out of control.\n\nOn Thursday, NSW reported 345 new locally acquired cases, most of them in Sydney, up from 344 a day earlier. Lockdown rules were tightened in three more local council areas in Sydney \u2013 Bayside, Strathfield and Burwood \u2013 limiting the movement of people to within 5km (3 miles) of their homes.\n\nOfficials also reported two deaths, two men in their 90s, taking the total deaths in the latest outbreak to 36. A total of 374 people are in hospital with the disease, 62 of them in intensive care with 29 on ventilators.\n\nA man reads a newspaper on the steps of Flinders Street Station in Melbourne, Australia, Wednesday, August 11, 2021 [Daniel Pockett/ AAP via AP]\n\nNSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the state\u2019s health system was under \u201cenormous pressure\u201d.\n\nNeighbouring Victoria state on Thursday reported 21 new locally acquired cases, up from 20 a day earlier, as five million residents of Melbourne, the state capital, prepare to enter a second week of lockdown. Of the new cases, six spent time in the community while infectious, a number which authorities have said must return to near zero before restrictions can be eased.\n\nAuthorities on Wednesday extended the lockdown in Melbourne for a further seven days until August 19.\n\nAustralia has largely avoided the high coronavirus numbers seen in many other countries, with just over 37,700 cases and 946 deaths, and several states remain almost COVID-19-free despite the outbreaks in Sydney and Melbourne. But the rapid spread of the Delta variant in New South Wales and a slow vaccine rollout has left the country vulnerable to a new wave of infections.\n\nOnly about 24 percent of people above 16 years of age are fully vaccinated and experts see Australia heading into a cycle of stop-and-start lockdowns until it vaccinates a higher proportion of the population.",

          "text": "Canada is violating international law by selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, according to a new report by rights groups Amnesty International Canada and Project Ploughshares, which are urging Ottawa to suspend all arms exports to Riyadh.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the report, titled \u2018No Credible Evidence\u2019: Canada\u2019s Flawed Analysis of Arms Exports to Saudi Arabia, accuses Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government of violating the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), an international agreement that Canada became a party to in 2019.\n\nCanadian weapons transfers to the Gulf kingdom could be used to commit or facilitate violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, the rights groups found, particularly in the ongoing conflict in Yemen.\n\n\u201cIt has been established through investigations and expert reports that Canadian weapons exports to [Saudi Arabia] are contrary to Canada\u2019s legal obligations under the ATT,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe war in Yemen broke out in late 2014 when Houthi rebels seized large swaths of the country, including the capital, Sanaa. The conflict escalated in March 2015 when Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates assembled a military coalition in an attempt to restore the government of Riyadh-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.\n\nThe ongoing war has pushed millions to the brink of famine in what the United Nations has described as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, and at least 233,000 people have died, according to a recent UN estimate.\n\n\u201cThere is persuasive evidence that weapons exported from Canada to KSA [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia], including LAVs [light-armoured vehicles] and sniper rifles, have been diverted for use in the war in Yemen,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report found.\n\n\u201cGiven the overriding risk posed by Canadian weapons exports to KSA, Canada must immediately revoke existing arms export permits to KSA and suspend the issuance of new ones.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Canada\u2019s foreign affairs department, Global Affairs Canada, told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that the government \u201cis committed to a rigorous arms export system\u201d.\n\n\u201cCanada has one of the strongest export controls systems in the world, and respect for human rights is enshrined in our export controls legislation,\u201d Lama Khodr said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cAfter a thorough review by officials, the Government announced last year that permits to KSA are now being reviewed on a case-by-case basis. These permits are not issued automatically and each of them are carefully scrutinized. Any permit application where there is a substantial risk of human rights violations will be denied,\u201d she said.\n\nBut for years, Canadian civil society groups have urged the federal government to cancel existing weapons contracts with Saudi Arabia and suspend all future permits, arguing that the arms could be used in rights violations both inside the Gulf nation and in Yemen.\n\nIn particular, rights groups have urged Canada to cancel a $12bn ($15bn Canadian) weapons contract to ship Canadian-made LAVs to the Saudi government.\n\nThat deal was reached under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, but Trudeau\u2019s government gave it the final green light. Early into his tenure as prime minister, Trudeau had defended the exports, saying they were consistent with the country\u2019s human rights obligations and foreign policy.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen has pushed millions to the brink of famine in what the United Nations has described as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis [File: Ali Owidha/Reuters]\n\nBut in the aftermath of the murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, he said his government was looking for a way out of the deal \u2013 and Ottawa ordered a review of weapons exports to Riyadh.\n\nKhashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was assassinated by a Saudi hit squad in October 2018 at the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. International experts and more recently, United States intelligence agencies, concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s de facto leader, approved the operation. The Saudi government has denied that allegation.\n\nDespite global pressure after the killing, in April 2020 the Canadian government lifted its freeze on weapons export permits to Saudi Arabia after a review, saying it had a robust system in place to ensure such permits meet Canada\u2019s requirements under domestic law and the ATT.\n\nIn a report following that review, Canada said \u201cthere is no substantial risk\u201d that military goods, including LAVs, \u201cwould be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of [international humanitarian law] in Yemen\u201d.\n\nCanadian weapons exports to Saudi Arabia totalled $1.05bn ($1.31bn Canadian) in 2020, according to government figures. That was second only to the US and accounted for 67 percent of Canada\u2019s total non-US arms exports.",

The drugs were donated to the trial by the manufacturers.\n\nThe WHO completed the first phase of the so-called Solidarity trials last year, working with countries worldwide to find effective treatments for the novel coronavirus and assess their effect on mortality, no matter how small. The new phase of the trial involves 600 hospitals in 52 countries \u2013 16 more than the initial phase \u2013 and thousands of patients.\n\nFour drugs have already been evaluated by the trial with results showing that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and interferon had little or no effect on people admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\n\nThe expansion of the trial comes as the world battles a new surge in the pandemic, fuelled by the highly transmissible Delta variant. Countries that have not been able to vaccinate a significant proportion of their population have been particularly hard hit.\n\nThe WHO has so far recommended only two treatments for COVID-19 \u2013 interleukin-6 receptor blockers, recommended last month, and corticosteroids. Trials in the United Kingdom last year found dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, reduced the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators.\n\nCountries taking part in the new trials include Canada, Finland, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nThe three new drugs:\n\nArtesunate\n\nArtesunate is produced by Ipca and is currently used to treat malaria. In the Solidarity trial, it will be administered intravenously for seven days, using the standard dose recommended for the treatment of severe malaria, the WHO said.\n\nArtesunate is a derivative of artemisinin, an antimalarial drug extracted from the herb Artemisia annua. Artemisinin and its derivatives have been extensively used in the treatment of malaria and other parasitic diseases for more than 30 years and are regarded as being very safe. The WHO COVID-19 Therapeutics Advisory Group recommended evaluating artesunate\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nImatinib\n\nImatinib is manufactured by Novartis and used to treat certain cancers. The WHO says patients participating in the trial will take the drug orally, once a day, for 14 days.\n\nImatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor formulated as an oral chemotherapy drug. Experimental and early clinical data suggest that imatinib reverses pulmonary capillary leak, while a randomised clinical trial performed in the Netherlands reported that imatinib might confer clinical benefits in patients in hospital with COVID-19.\n\nInfliximab\n\nProduced by Johnson & Johnson, infliximab is used to treat diseases of the immune system. For the trial, it will be administered intravenously as a single dose, based on the standard dose given to patients with Crohn\u2019s Disease over extended periods, the UN agency said.\n\nInfliximab is a TNF alpha inhibitor, a class of biologics that have been approved for the treatment of certain autoimmune inflammatory conditions for more than 20 years. It has shown favourable efficacy and safety in restricting broad spectrum inflammation, including in elderly people who are the most clinically vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nAljazeera",

          "text": "Zambians are voting in nationwide elections after a tense campaign dominated by economic woes and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nApproximately seven million citizens are registered to vote for a president, legislators and local government representatives in the polls that opened at 6am (04:00 GMT) on Thursday and close 12 hours later at more than 12,000 voting stations across the vast country.\n\nThe winning candidate must receive more than 50 percent of votes to avoid a runoff, which analysts deem unlikely.\n\nSixteen presidential candidates are vying for the top job, but the frontrunners are incumbent Edgar Lungu, 64, and his longtime nemesis, business tycoon Hakainde Hichilema, 59, who are facing off at the polls for the third time.\n\nHichilema, who is running for the sixth time, is backed by an alliance of 10 parties.\n\nHundreds of people waited in long queues before sunrise on Thursday to cast ballots at a secondary school in Lusaka\u2019s Matero township.\n\nPresident Lungu was among the first people to vote in the capital Lusaka.\n\nAfter casting his ballot at a school in Chawama, a poor neighbourhood of Lusaka, Lungu told reporters that \u201cZambians are ready to vote and they come in numbers\u201d.\n\nRising living costs have eroded the incumbent\u2019s support base, surveys suggest, and the election could be even tighter than 2016 polls when Hichilema lost by about 100,000 votes.\n\nLungu, a lawyer by training, is accused of unsustainable borrowing, particularly from Chinese creditors, to finance a spree of infrastructure projects.\n\nUnder him, Zambia became the first African country to default on its sovereign debt since the coronavirus pandemic began, while inflation soared to 24.6 percent in June, the highest rate in more than a decade.\n\nAfrica\u2019s second-biggest producer of copper after the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the eighth producer in the world, missed another debt repayment this year.\n\n\u201cI am voting for change. We can\u2019t continue on this path,\u201d said Andrew Daka, 20, who was voting for the first time in his life.\n\nBut Lungu says \u201cthings are moving well in the country\u201d and is confident of victory, although his critics point to the high cost of living, poverty and joblessness.\n\nThe vote will \u201cbe influenced by poor governance and the economy, which is biting,\u201d said O\u2019Brien Kaaba, a political scientist at the University of Zambia.\n\nTensions have flared in the run-up to polling in this southern African country of 17 million people.\n\nSupporters of Lungu\u2019s Patriotic Front (PF) party and Hichilema\u2019s United Party for National Development (UPND) have clashed violently on several occasions, prompting Lungu to deploy the army.\n\nCritics denounced the unprecedented move as a tactic to intimidate opposition voters, which the PF denies.\n\nThe president has also grown tough on dissent since he took power in 2015, raising concerns of a heavy-handed response if results are contested.\n\nUPND supporters are keeping a low profile in Lusaka, a Lungu stronghold, for fear of being attacked by PF counterparts.\n\nLungu is confident of securing half a million votes more than Hichilema because \u201cpeople now know me\u201d.\n\n\u201cZambia is at a crossroads,\u201d Hichilema said on Wednesday, pledging to redress the economy. \u201cSo much money was borrowed at a very high cost and this is frustrating development efforts.\u201d\n\nZambia owes in excess of $12bn to external creditors and spends 30 to 40 percent of its revenues on interest payments on its debt, credit rating firm S&P Global estimates.\n\n\u201cWe need a leadership that can put in place some planning to rebuild the economy,\u201d Hichilema said.\n\nIn the absence of credible opinion polls, analysts say Hichilema\u2019s economic pitch, which has bolstered his support among young, frustrated and jobless voters, could be the deciding factor in the vote.\n\nTalks over an IMF aid package, already broadly agreed, are on hold until after the vote. So too is debt restructuring seen as an early test of a new global plan to ease poor countries\u2019 debt burdens.\n\n\u201cInvestors may see a potentially clearer path to an IMF programme and a debt restructuring under HH,\u201d Christian Libralato, emerging markets portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, which holds Zambia\u2019s defaulted bonds.\n\nThe opposition has accused the government of seeking to rig the ballot \u2013 allegations the PF has rejected.\n\nLocal and international observers will be monitoring polling stations, some of which will be using a biometric voter identification system for the first time.\n\nOfficial results are expected by Sunday.",
