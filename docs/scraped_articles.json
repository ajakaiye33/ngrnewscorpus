          "text": "The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, said he dedicated a white garment church last September based on divine instruction.\n\nThe cleric, who recently clocked 80 years, disclosed this on Sunday during a special sermon titled, \u2018Going Higher (Part 54)\u2019.\n\nThe octogenarian had in September 2021 dedicated the Lagos cathedral of the Love of Christ Generation Church C&S (Worldwide), founded by Reverend Esther Ajayi amid sweeping criticisms by Pentecostals.\n\nBut Adeboye, on Sunday, said he was directed by God to dedicate Ajayi\u2019s church.\n\nThe octogenarian said, \u201cIn Acts 11:1-18, after Peter came from the house of Cornelius, the great apostles gathered together, called him to a meeting and challenged him; \u2018What were you doing in the house of a gentile? We heard that you went there?\u2019 They didn\u2019t tell us all that they said but they probably told him; \u2018You went to the house of a gentile because he was rich.\u2019. Peter had to say that the spirit made him go.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Adeboye said, \u201cWhether you believe it or not, I got quite a lot of queries recently from well-meaning Christians: \u2018Daddy GO Sir, we learnt that you went to a white garment church to dedicate a church. You of all people?\u2019\n\n\u201cI said the spirit made me go. I was obeying the spirit.\n\n\u201cYears ago, I think 1982 or so, I was invited to one little white-garment church, it wasn\u2019t a big one. I went because they said they have heard about me and I should come and preach. I got to the door, they asked me to remove my shoes, I did, because the spirit made me go.\n\n\u201cThere was a man in the church, an engineer, that God knew He was going to need in the building of a campground that we had not even located at the time.\n\n\u201cI went, I preached, he (the engineer) gave his life to Jesus. He came to the Redeemed Christian Church of God and he became the engineer who started the work of the camp, he was the second-in-command to the Baba Adura (spiritual head of the white garment church).\n\n\u201cI went because God said, \u2018Go.\u2019 In the things of God, don\u2019t jump to conclusion, tread carefully.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Also, influence from members of your family and friends, your physical and mental health as well as integrating with the civil society, must be properly managed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I urge you to be proactive in your conduct to overcome these challenges because your loyalty to the Armed Forces of Nigeria and the Federal Republic is non-negotiable,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile reminding them that the society would expect high moral standards and discipline from them, he urged them to prove that they passed through a highly disciplined system.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am sure that your training exposed you to several vocational opportunities and general management skills to alleviate the above mentioned pitfalls in order to have a stress-free and meaningful life in retirement.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectation that after your graduation, the Services and Centre will continue to get positive feedback as you gallantly soar through post-service life. You are encouraged to be bold, courageous, disciplined, focused and the sky will be your beginning. You will from now take full charge as planners and executors of your personal daily activities. This may sound exciting and patronizing but beware; you need to properly manage your freedom and make good use of your resources to be successful.\n\n\u201cAs our ambassadors, remember this is your constituency, make the Armed Forces proud. It is important at this point to let you know that the level of insecurity is taking a new dimension. So as you retire into the larger society, please beware of subversive elements within your environment and do not associate with them in any form.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasize that you are still beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Scheme programme and I advise that you do the necessary documentation to enable you access post-retirement medicare without any deduction from your retirement benefits.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Commandant, NAFRIC, Air-Vice Marshal Idi Gamso Lubo, disclosed that the Centre had trained 50,000 retiring military personnel since inception.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe training the centre provides helps beneficiaries to be equipped with skills for self-sustenance and meaningful income while approaching life with a positive mindset. This will enable them to contribute meaningfully to their various societies thus reducing crime, criminality as well as other vices in our society.\u201d\n\nHe also congratulated the graduands for successfully completing the three months course, describing it as a proof of their determination, commitment and discipline maintained in the course of their service years.\n\nWhile appreciating President Muhammadu Buhari for his support to the development of the centre and the Armed Forces, he also appreciated family members of the graduands for their support although the service years of the retirees.",

The Academic Staff Union of Universities and National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT) are already on strike over Federal Government\u2019s failure to implement agreements with them..\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Sen Chris Ngige, told The Nation last night the government had decided to apply the \u201cNo-work, No Pay\u201d policy in compliance with Section 43 of the Labour Law.\n\nNgige said that the actions of the unions amounted to \u201cfalse leave\u201d and a declaration of forced holidays for students.

          "title": "Buhari: Our Unity at Convention Signposts Victory in 2023 Polls",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Sunday Aborisade, Emameh Gabriel, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kan\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the unity of purpose displayed by the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at its national convention on Saturday was indicative of the party\u2019s promising success in the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nBuhari congratulated the newly elected APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the 79-member National Executive Committee (NEC) elected at the convention. But he blamed the media for reporting imaginary division within the ranks of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nAdamu, who emerged through a consensus arrangement, also took a swipe at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his acceptance speech, saying the opposition party is sad and disappointed at the success of the ruling party\u2019s national convention. He spoke yesterday after the new National Working Committee (NWC) of APC was sworn in.\n\nThe new national chairman argued that PDP and other opposition elements had expected to make a political fortune from an anticipated crisis-ridden convention. He said the ruling party had fulfilled its covenant with Nigerians.\n\n\n\nThe accusation came as Adamu\u2019s strongest rival and former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, also said the successful convention had put APC\u2019s enemies and naysayers to shame.\n\nSimilarly, Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola said at the weekend that the successful outcome of Saturday\u2019s national convention of APC was proof that the party would remain in power beyond 2023.\n\n\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Ou; his Ekiti State counterpart, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; and President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, congratulated Adamu and other members of the new NWC as well as the zonal executives of APC on their election.\n\n\n\nBut the PDP leadership, yesterday, mocked APC for allegedly imposing as its chairman a man arraigned in court on 149-count charge bordering on fraudulent award of contracts and stealing of public funds estimated at N15 billion.\n\nHowever, Buhari, in a release by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, stressed that the intraparty unity display during the convention had put the ruling party on a firmer footing for victory in the forthcoming general election.\n\nThe president returned to the convention ground at Eagle Square, Saturday morning, along with the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the senate president, to witness and celebrate the inauguration of the newly elected party executives. He said the smooth conduct of the election had raised the prospect of a mouth-watering APC victory next year.\n\n\n\nBuhari stated in the release, \u201cThe APC convention hosted this weekend sets the scene for an APC victory in the presidential and general elections next year. It is a victory over naysayers, who believed the party was divided but are now disappointed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is equally a victory for the president who has ensured unity across all party positions; and it is a victory for the voters of Nigeria, who can now be assured of a smooth succession to new leadership in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhat the convention made clear was how the media has been peddling fake news of division, when the hard reality of unity, cohesion, and, indeed, personal warmth between members of the party\u2019s leaders \u2013 incoming and outgoing \u2013 was evident for all to see.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the blame for this mindset ought rightly to go to the opposition, who in all these years had done the work to only divide the country, leading to all manner of separatist agitations. But this is not the wish, nor is it in the character of the citizens, as was clear for everyone to see at the Eagle Square.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen their fake news of disunity was undone by the facts, some in the opposition could not help themselves but take to the newspapers and the airwaves to find another way to shore up their reputations. That some of the APC\u2019s new leadership were once in the opposition was the new line to take to the media, somehow suggesting that those who have left one party should not hold positions in another. Yet, do the Scriptures not teach us of the virtue of sinners who repent and change their ways?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the Scriptures say less is of sinners who repent, change their tune, and then choose to re-sin in full public view by returning to their former ways. Given that most important leaders of the opposition PDP first left the party before they returned to it, we might expect the media to ensure criticism of them is damning and absolute. It is incredulous that anyone would consider them trustworthy or acceptable candidates for any public office.\n\n\u201cThe stage is now set for the APC primary elections later this year, when the party\u2019s new flag bearers will emerge. No doubt, some will attempt to argue the impossible \u2013 that an APC primary election is a source of division while an opposition primary election is a source of consensus.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the good voters of Nigeria can see through such acrobatics and know the facts that, when the contests for 2023 come, APC offers a track record of success and leadership, while the opposition has only decades of failure and complicity in response.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking after he was sworn in, Adamu said, \u201cAs we conclude this very successful convention of our great party, I know that our opponents in PDP and other opposition parties are now sulking, wearing long faces of sadness, bewilderment and dismay.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey had been hoping and praying to make a fortune out of our misfortunes. They were also hoping and praying to capitalise on assumed failures of our party to reap political benefits.\u201d\n\nAdamu, who emerged through a consensus arrangement after all the other six contestants were prevailed upon to step down, pleaded with all aspirants to \u201cshow maturity and good sportsmanship and accept the outcome of this convention with grace.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stressed that even though they did not achieve their ambitions at the convention, a good number of them would still serve the party and the country in several other positions of responsibility.\n\nThe APC national chairman said, \u201cWe are, however, satisfied that APC has fulfilled its covenant with the Nigerian people. Of the three main pillars of its promises to the Nigerian people in 2015, that is, security, economy and anti-corruption, much progress has been recorded in all three areas and many more.\n\n\u201cAPC is set to do much, much more when Nigerians continue to bestow on us their love, support and confidence in next year\u2019s general election.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdamu said no administration had the record of APC in the provision of critical infrastructure, which was hitherto considered impossible in the country. He listed such projects to include \u201cthe Second Niger Bridge, complete rehabilitation of the Lagos-Ibadan dual carriageway, the Lagos-Ibadan express rail, the Abuja-Kaduna express light rail, the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano pipeline\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nAdamu took the oath of office and oath of allegiance at 12:22pm yesterday at an event witnessed by Buhari, Osinbajo, Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Attorney General the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubkar Malami, governors, and other members of the party.\n\nHe called on all aggrieved members of APC to put their differences aside and work for the interest of the party.\n\nAdamu thanked the president and leaders of the party at all levels, as well as members of the party nationwide for electing them into offices of responsibility and promised to discharge his duty with diligence.\n\n\n\nHe said while he acknowledged the onerous responsibility that had been placed on their shoulders as an executive, they would work hard to ensure that expectations were met and the party was not disappointed.\n\nTo those, who lost in the contest, Adamu said, \u201cI wish to also congratulate the great party men and women, who also aspired to occupy these national offices of our great party. They did not succeed this time but in God\u2019s time, many of them will yet realise their ambitions to serve our party and country in many other positions of responsibility.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs politicians, we are not strangers to gains, losses and disappointments with the outcome of every political contest. Let us show maturity and good sportsmanship and accept the outcome of this convention with grace. Our party needs all hands on the steering wheel so that together we can steer the ship of state through the inclement weather of our divisive national politics to the promised land.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe charged APC members to renew their faith in the party and its leadership at all levels and remain patriotic.\n\nOn reconciliation, he said, \u201cWe need to commit to the resolution of our crisis within the confines of our party constitution. We must resist the temptation to blow every minor personal disagreement into a major party crisis. It is time for us to do things differently. When we quarrel, we open our flanks to our rival political parties that are only too eager to exploit them for their own benefit.\n\n\n\n\u201cI promise you here and now that we shall heal any wounds in our party; we shall effect lasting reconciliation among our members, and we shall go into the next general election as a strong and united party. I offer my hands of friendship to all our members. I want to assure you that my colleagues and myself will run an open-door policy to all members of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cTogether, let us rise and march towards the sunrise in our party and in our country. The time has come for us to show statesmanship to arrive at the new dawn. The time has come for us to be patriotic in words and deeds. The time has come for us to affirm our being the party of the people, for the people and by the people.\u201d\n\nHe urged the media to address the tone, content, and standard of reporting, appealing to them to take a cue from the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Malam Abubakar Imam, Alhaji Alade Odunewu and other media pioneers, who upheld \u201cthe patriotic spirit of the founding fathers of their profession.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdamu, a founding member of PDP, two-term PDP governor of Nasarawa State, and secretary, Board of Trustees of the PDP, before emerging senator under the PDP, defected to the APC at the twilight of the ex-President Goodluck Jonathan administration in 2014.\n\nThe new National Secretary of the party, Senator Iyiola Omisore, was also a PDP senator for Osun East from 2003 to 2011.\n\n\n\nThe list of politicians with PDP foundation in control at the APC NWC is long and include Festus Fuanter (Plateau State), Deputy National Secretary; Muazu Bawa Rjau (Niger State), National Vice Chairman, North-central; Mustapha Salihu (Adamawa State), National Vice Chairman, North-east; Barr Ahmed El-Marzuk (Katsina State), National Legal Adviser; Uguru Matthew Ofoka (Ebonyi State), National Treasurer; Senator Abubakar Maikafi (Bauchi State), National Auditor; Dr Betta Edu (Cross River State), National Women Leader; Barr F.N. Nwosu (Abia State), National Welfare Secretary; and Nze Chidi Duru (Anambra State), Deputy National Organising Secretary.\n\nJigawa State Governor and chairman of the convention committee, Bello Matawalle, said, five positions were contested out of the 35 national officers and only few on the zonal level, out of the whole 78 positions.\n\nAlmakura, Salihu Mustapha, Mohammed Etsu, Abdulaziz Yari, Sani Muhammed, and George Akume were the six chairmanship aspirants, who stepped down for Adamu after a consensus agreement was reached just hours before the convention proper.\n\nAl-Makura: We Disappointed Naysayers, Enemies\n\nFormer Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, said APC disappointed naysayers and put the enemies of the party to shame with the successful conduct of its national convention. Al-Makura, in a statement, congratulated Adamu, who emerged new national chairman of the party.\n\n\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn displaying our first-rate problem-solving, dispute resolution, and organisational aptitude through a rancour-free and smooth national convention, our party has, once again, disappointed the naysayers and put the enemies of the party to shame.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the national convention done and dusted, I have no doubt that our great party is now well-repositioned and good to go into the 2023 elections with confidence, as I have no doubt that the new leadership has all it takes to navigate our party to victory in 2023 and beyond.\u201d\n\nOyetola: Successful Outing is Proof We\u2019ll Remain in Power Beyond 2023\n\nOsun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, at the weekend, said the successful outcome of Saturday\u2019s national convention of APC was proof that the party would remain in power beyond 2023. Oyetola was happy everything went well, despite negative expectations of pessimists\n\n\n\nHe expressed confidence in the ability of the new National Secretary of the party and representative of Osun State in the National Working committee (NWC), Senator Iyiola Omisore, to deliver, even as he congratulated the party\u2019s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\n\n\nThe Osun State governor, who said the peaceful conduct of the convention was a sign that the ruling party was united, formidable and remained indivisible, also held the view that Adamu would bring his wealth of experience to bear in the administration and management of the party\u2019s affairs.\n\nOyetola, in a statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Ismail Omipidan, expressed confidence in the existing unity in APC. With this he said the party would remain in power beyond 2023, by the grace of God, and thanked Buhari for providing the right leadership.\n\n\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cFirst of all, I must thank our leaders in the South-west for their support for our own Senator Iyiola Omisore. This is a great thing for us in Osun APC and I must thank other contestants for conceding and accepting to withdraw from the race.\n\n\n\n\u201cI commend them for the bold step, just as I assure them of our support in their time of need. I have no doubt in the capacity of Otunba Omisore to deliver and take our party to a greater level.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, the peaceful atmosphere here and the seamless conduct of the convention, is a testimony to the strong unity that exists in our party. It is an attestation to the fact that we have our ways of resolving issues without necessarily resorting to conflict.\n\n\n\n\u201cContrary to the negative expectations of some people, the convention went peacefully. The security operatives have done wonderfully well. I am really proud of what has happened today (Saturday). It is a sign that our party is united, formidable and remains indivisible.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn achieving all these, I must personally commend the leadership quality provided by President Muhammadu Buhari, who always advocates harmony and peace in the party. It is natural to have disagreement, but what is important is the ability to have a workable mechanism to resolve any crisis without necessarily resorting to rancour.\u201d\n\n\n\nExpressing in confidence in the ability of Omisore to deliver and contribute to the growth of the party through his new position, the governor said Omisore would deploy his political sagacity, leadership qualities and experience, which he acquired in public and private sectors, towards building a virile and healthy party at the centre.\n\nSanwo-Olu Congratulates New Party Leadership\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, congratulated the newly elected national chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and other members of the NWC as well as zonal executives of the ruling party. Sanwo-Olu charged the Adamu-led NWC to work tirelessly with APC leaders and stakeholders to make the ruling party stronger for it to retain power in 2023 at the federal level and win more states in addition to the 22 states currently governed by the party.\n\n\n\nThe governor commended Buhari for his fatherly and leadership role in ensuring that that APC national and zonal executives emerged through a consensus arrangement. He noted that many aspirants, especially, the national chairmanship aspirants, stepped down, because of the respect they had for Buhari and other leaders of the party.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who was excited with the outcome of the convention, also commended the aspirants, who voluntarily stepped down for members of the NWC and zonal executives at the six geo-political zones to emerge through a consensus arrangement.\n\n\n\nSanwo-Olu, who was Chairman, Finance Committee for the APC National Convention, praised over 7,000 delegates from 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, for participating in the convention.\n\n\n\nHe also congratulated the representatives of Lagos State in the National Working Committee (NWC), Mr. Dayo Israel, who was elected APC National Youth Leader as well as former Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Lateef Ibirogba, who emerged South-west Zonal Organising Secretary.\n\nThe governor implored the new executives to work hard with APC national, zonal and state executives, as well as party leaders and members for victory of the ruling party in Lagos State, South-west and Nigeria, at large, during the 2023 general election.\n\nFayemi Rejoices With Adamu, Others, Lauds Buni on Successful Tenure\n\nEkiti State Governor and Chairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, congratulated the newly elected national executives of APC under the chairmanship of former Nassarawa State Governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on their emergence at the party\u2019s just concluded national convention.\n\n\n\nFayemi lauded the APC national caretaker committee headed by Yobe State Governor, Mai Malla Buni, for organising a successful national convention aimed at strengthening the party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement shortly after the new executives were inaugurated, Fayemi said he was happy the party\u2019s convention held successfully, despite initial anxieties, divergent interests and opinions of members over what they considered the best way moving forward.\n\n\n\nHe congratulated Adamu, the national Secretary, Omisore, and other elected NWC members, whose elections were ratified at the convention, and wished them success in the task of repositioning APC as the undisputable number one political party in the country with attendant electoral fortunes.\n\n\n\nHe urged the new national officers to look beyond the various opposition expressed by individuals or groups to their aspirations ahead of the convention, saying it is normal in any democratic setting. He urged the new executives to hit the ground running by reaching out to aggrieved party members and running an inclusive administration.\n\nLawan: Integrity, Experience Earned Adamu APC Chairmanship\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, while congratulating Abdullahi Adamu on his emergence as the new national chairman of APC, said integrity and experience earned him the position.\n\nLawan, in a congratulatory message on Sunday, reiterated that Adamu\u2019s victory at the national convention was a testimony to the tremendous respect he enjoyed across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity.\n\n\n\nLawan said, \u201cI heartily congratulate His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on his emergence as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the just concluded National Convention of our great party.\n\n\u201cThe unanimous affirmation of Senator Adamu\u2019s candidature at the convention is a testimony to the tremendous respect that he enjoys across the polity for his integrity, experience and leadership capacity. I share this common belief in his suitability for piloting the affairs of our great party from this very important juncture.\n\n\u201cSenator Adamu\u2019s antecedents as a political leader and astute administrator show that our party has made a great choice in his election as our National Chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe senate president also congratulated other members of the newly inaugurated NWC and zonal officers of the party on their elections and urged them all to do their best to deliver their mandates and live up to the great expectations of the teeming members of APC across and outside of Nigeria.\n\nThe senate president said the people of Yobe State were extremely proud of Buni for his achievements while he was chairman of the CECPC of the APC.\n\nGbajabiamila: We Remain One Big Family\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, said the way things turned out at the convention were proof the party remained one big family. Gbajabiamila said this while congratulating Adamu on his emergence as chairman at the party\u2019s national convention on Saturday.\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila also congratulated other elected members of the party\u2019s NWC, such as Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari; Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Emma Eneukwu; National Secretary, Otunba Iyiola Omisore and the six vice chairmen, among others.\n\n\n\nThe Speaker, in a congratulatory message, reiterated that Adamu\u2019s emergence through a consensus arrangement proved that APC was one big family, where its members resolved their differences amicably.\n\nHe, however, tasked the new chairman and the other members of the NWC to put heads together to transform the party ahead of the 2023 general elections, He expressed optimism in the ability of Adamu and his NWC members to rally round APC members and other Nigerians to take the party to victory.\n\nYahaya Excited over Convention Outcome, Hails Buhari\n\nGombe State Governor, Alhaji Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, expressed excitement over the outcome of the party\u2019s national convention, which elected former Nasarawa State governor, Abdullahi Adamu, as National Chairman. Yahaya also hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for provided the much-needed leadership.\n\nIn a statement issued by his Director General, Press Affairs, Ismaila Uba Misilli, the governor also felicitated with other national and zonal officers of the APC, who were elected.\n\n\n\nInuwa, particularly, praised the leadership, direction, and guidance of Buhari, which, he said, facilitated the consensus arrangement that produced the leaders of APC.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe maturity displayed at the convention has demonstrated the spirit of unity of purpose and strong will of our members as well as indivisiblity of the force of our great party.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecial appreciation must go to our leader and amiable President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for providing leadership and guidance that saw to the successful and rancour-free conduct of the convention.\n\n\n\nThe governor also praised the caretaker/extraordinary national convention planning committee, headed by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, for successfully superintending over the affairs of APC within the period of its stewardship and for strengthening unity, understanding and camaraderie among party faithful.\n\nWe\u2019re Equal to the Task, Says Ganduje\n\nKano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje said the party had the necessary capability to succeed in the conduct of its national convention. In a statement yesterday, Ganduje said the exercise had made the party more united and stronger.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd we are sure we are equal to the task. It is also a great success if you look at the procedures followed in order to come up with this exercise. I know you are aware that President Muhammadu Buhari has advised us to go on consensus,\u201d Ganduje said.\n\n\n\nTo effectively comply with Buhari\u2019s advice, the governor said, \u201cWe undertook a lot of consensus in this exercise.\u201d\n\nHe explained that in areas where consensus did not work, they had to go into election with all the proper procedures for election.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can see that they have counted votes and some announcements were made. Winners have already emerged as winners,\u201d he said.\n\nGanduje appreciated that at the end of the exercise, \u201cWe have come up with a new brand of leadership.\u201d\n\nYour Chairman is Battling Alleged Corruption, Opposition Mocks\n\nPDP, yesterday, mocked APC over its choice of Abdullahi Adamu as national chairman, saying he is battling corruption allegation. The opposition party said Adamu had been arraigned in court on a 149-count charge of alleged fraudulent award of contracts and stealing of public funds estimated at N15 billion.\n\n\n\nPDP described the APC event as a convention of lies, celebration of illegality, corruption and arrogance in failure, adding that any leadership birthed through such process can only be overtly corrupt, debauch and illegal.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, PDP said it was clear that with the combination of the corrupt, deceitful and rudderless Buhari-led APC government and the illegitimate Adamu-led party leadership, corruption, economic hardship and rudderless movement in the APC government would worsen in the country in the remaining one year of the APC in government.\n\n\n\nPDP said the composition of the APC national leadership was a clear confirmation that Buhari had never been committed to the fight against corruption as well as his willingness to further open the national vaults to ravenous treasury looters in APC.\n\nIt challenged members of the APC national leadership, particularly, Adamu, to come clean on corruption charges against them.\n\n\n\nPDP stated, \u201cThe new APC chairman should inform Nigerians why he was not courageous enough to submit himself to trial at the Federal High Court, Lafia, Nasarawa State, rather than hide under technicalities. Senator Adamu should, therefore, come clean to Nigerians on the said case before parading himself as a saint.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, pathetic to see Senator Adamu showboating on stage to impress his puppet master by attempting to denigrate other Nigerians and our great party, the PDP.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur party has only pity for Senator Adamu and does not intend to confer him an undue relevance with a response. Senator Adamu should, however, be conscious of the fact that time does not run against the state in criminal matters. He should, therefore, not have any illusion that being an APC chairman will avail him a perpetual cover.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was appalling to see APC leaders come out one after the other at their national jamboree to spew out lies and false performance claims on the economy, infrastructure and security even in the face of biting economic hardship, high cost of living, excruciating fuel emergency, lingering crisis in the education sector and escalated insecurity that was happening real time and simultaneously when the ridiculous claims of achievement were being made.\n\n\u201cIs it not shameful that while APC leaders were lying on stage in Abuja, terrorists were busy attacking the Kaduna International Airport, located in an APC-controlled state?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP, however, restated its cautions that the APC NWC did not have the legitimacy of office as the process that produced it under the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) remained unconstitutional and flawed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Kaduna Airport Attack: PDP, Afenifere Knock Buhari, Raise the Alarm",
          "text": "\n\n* House Minority Caucus demands investigation\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, yesterday criticised the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for Saturday\u2019s invasion of the Kaduna International Airport by bandits. PDP said the development was a clear confirmation that the command and control structure of the country\u2019s security under Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) had collapsed.\n\n\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives equally expressed shock at the brazen invasion and takeover of the airport by terrorists. The caucus, in a statement by its leader,\n\nHon. Ndudi Elumelu, called for urgent and comprehensive investigation into the circumstances leading to what it called an apparent compromise of security at the airport, which paved way for the breach.\n\n\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the alarming invasion of the airport by terrorists at a time outlaws, kidnappers, and marauders had taken over the highways and railways heightened security concerns and fears that nowhere was safe in the country under APC.\n\n\n\nAccording to PDP, \u201cThe refusal and failure of Buhari and the APC to take action on the airport attack but continued to jamboree in Abuja in the name of a national convention reveal and confirm that the Buhari administration has conceded sovereignty over parts of the country to terrorists.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe main opposition party said Buhari\u2019s nonchalant disposition to the grave security challenge was an indication that his administration was \u201cunable, unwilling and or complicit in this particular attack as well as various other acts of terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nPDP stated that it was \u201cindefensibly suspicious that while an international airport in the country was under attack by over 200 terrorists, with many Nigerians being held hostage and traumatised, President Buhari and the APC continued in their carnival in Abuja without acknowledging or expressing concern.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt wondered, \u201cIs this not a case of \u2018Buhari fiddles while Nigeria burns?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe party also said, \u201cThe APC government has failed, become numb to violence against our citizens, and can no longer perform its primary duty under Section 14 (2)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), which provides that \u2018security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party argued that Buhari\u2019s failure to address the Kaduna airport attack was consistent with his characteristic abdication of duty at critical times, recalling how in January, the president cancelled his scheduled visit to Zamfara State, a state it claimed was daily traumatised by terrorists.\n\n\n\nPDP alleged, \u201cBy that action, Mr. President allowed shared sovereignty with terrorists over a part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This acquiesce emboldened the terrorists to now expand their control to the international airport in Kaduna, ostensibly with the possibility of using it to import arms and ammunition as well as coordinate terrorist activities in our country.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the main features or determinants of sovereignty is the ability of an authority to impose taxes, enforce collection, control commercial activities as well as exit and entry points, including airports.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnder President Buhari, terrorists have established sovereignty in substantial parts of the country, especially in the North-west and North-east regions, where terrorists execute laws and impose penalties, collect taxes, control commercial and transportation activities and now take control of an international airport with grave negative consequences to our national image in the world.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur country has never had it this bad with such a weak, uncoordinated, and clueless president with an inhumane, visionless and propaganda-driven political party like the APC.\u201d\n\n\n\nPDP stressed that Nigerians should rally round its members in their mission \u201cto rescue the nation from the precipice and restore the unity and security of her people.\u201d\n\nOn its part, Afenifere stated that the airport invasion by suspected terrorists was another indication of the deteriorating security situation in the country.\n\n\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, frowned on the incident, which happened on the very day the ruling APC was holding its national convention in Abuja. It warned that some people seemed to be bent on re-enacting the Afghanistan situation in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThe group called on all those who believed in freedom, peaceful co-existence, personal liberty, true knowledge, and progress to rise up and ensure people who should act acted promptly.\n\nAfenifere listed some security infractions that took place between Friday and Saturday in parts of the country and regretted that it was as though the country was at war, especially, in those areas where the unfortunate incidents occurred.\n\n\n\nAmong the incidents cited by the Yoruba group were the sacking of communities in Kaduna, Niger, and Enugu states by terrorist, leading to loss of lives, burning down of property, and forceful takeover of people\u2019s possessions.\n\nAccording to Afenifere, \u201cIt is a matter of serious concern that these security infractions happened at a time that government kept assuring us that it was on top of the situation. Some of these attacks by terrorists even occurred in broad daylight, that of Kaduna airport and that of Enugu, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt asserted that for terrorists to have the audacity to attack an airport, despite all the available security apparatus, meant there was hardly anywhere safe in the country.\n\nAfenifere maintained, \u201cThe federal government should immediately allow states to set up their own police forces, empower the existing security agencies, and stop treating terrorists with kid gloves. These must be done immediately so that Nigeria does not go the Afghanistan way.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe House Minority Caucus called for an urgent investigation to discover the remote and immediate circumstances leading to the security breach at the Kaduna airport.\n\nThe lawmakers said the horrific development was another frightening commentary on the apparent collapse of national security and intelligence gathering coordination under the APC administration.\n\n\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe Minority Caucus is deeply concerned and alarmed by the manifest lack of capacity by the APC administration to secure our nation to the extent that a strategic international airport in our country could be invaded and taken over by terrorists. Airports, especially international airports across the world, are usually highly secured areas. Therefore, the circumstances that allowed for the invasion of the Kaduna International Airport speak volumes about the failure of the APC administration.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe attack on the airport at the time when our roads, railways and communities are being overrun by bandits, kidnappers and invaders has heightened fear across the country as well as sent a very worrisome signal to the international community regarding the safety of our airports and the worsening insecurity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur caucus urges the federal government to immediately beef up security in all our airports and other public convergence facilities in our country so as to forestall a re-occurrence of such terrifying attack.\u201d\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nA total of 10 commercial banks that have so far released their full year 2021 financial results reported N39.4 trillion as customers\u2019 deposits, which was an increase of 17.6 per cent compared with the N33.47 trillion reported in 2020, amid the sustained battle for customers between the banks and financial technology (fintech) customers.\n\nThe figures were compiled by THISDAY, from the 2021 full year results of the banks submitted to the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX). The banks considered were those that have so far released their financial results.\n\n\n\nThe Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, Access Bank, Zenith Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), and Guaranty Trust Holding Plc were major tier-1 banks that contributed to the N39.4trillion customers deposit in the year under review.\n\nOn the other hand, the tier-2 banks included Fidelity Bank Plc, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, FCMB group, Sterling Bank Plc and Wema Bank Plc.\n\n\n\nData gathered from the banks\u2019 results revealed that ETI, a pan-African bank, led others in term of customer deposits in the year under review, given its banking operations in 13 African countries. Precisely, while ETI grew its deposits from customers by 13 per cent to N8.28 trillion in 2021, up from N7.32 trillion in 2020, Access Bank\u2019s deposit from customers increased by 24.5 per cent to N6.95 trillion in 2021, higher than the N5.59 trillion the bank reported in 2020.\n\n\n\nAs gathered from its 2021 financial statement, Zenith Bank reported 21 per cent increase in deposit from customers to N6.47 trillion, from N5.34 trillion in 2020, while UBA grew its customers\u2019 deposits by 12.2 per cent to N6.4 trillion in 2021, from N5.68 trillion in 2020 and GTCO\u2019s customers deposit rose by 14.3 per cent to N4 trillion in 2021, from N3.51trillion in 2020.\n\n\n\nFor Fidelity Bank, the financial institution led the league of tier-2 banks in terms of customers\u2019 deposits in the 2021 financial year, reporting N2.02 trillion in the year under review, from N1.69 trillion in 2020. It was followed by Stanbic IBTC Holdings which reported N1.56 trillion customers deposit in 2021, up from N1.33 trillion in 2020; while the FCMB Group grew its customers\u2019 deposit by 24 per cent to N1.56 trillion in 2021, up from N1.26 trillion in 2020.\n\nIn addition, Sterling Bank reported 27.1 per cent growth in customer deposits to N1.21 trillion in 2021, up from N950.8 billion in 2020, as Wema Bank reported N927 billion in 2021 from N804.87 billion in 2020.\n\nAnalysts noted that the granting of payment service bank (PSB) license to some telcos was going to create an aggressive market in term of customer deposits.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, commercial banks are facing severe competition in terms of customer deposits with the continuous expansion by fintechs such as Flutterwave, Paystack, PiggyVest, Kuda, among others.\n\n\n\nTo the Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, David Adnori, banks are going to be more aggressive in winning customers with mouthwatering promo, adding that the economy stands to benefit as more people would join the financial inclusion objective of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\n\n\nAlso, finance expert, Mr. Rotimi Fakayejo said the double-digit growth in customer deposits by banks revealed that more people needed to be engaged in savings.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFintechs have tremendous advantages over banks. They are mostly tailored to meet the needs of the younger demographic, and they have had a lot of media buzz that has for the most part trended positively in their favour.\n\n\n\n\u201cTheir main strength revolves around the innovations that are closely associated with their brands. But, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Fintech startups will replace commercial banks any time soon, for a number of reasons.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Renames APC national secretariat after Buhari\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nOutgoing Caretaker Committee Chairman of the ruling All Progressive Congress and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, has said that he would leave behind a strong and united APC family to his successor.\n\nBuni on his valedictory speech at the APC national convention, gave account of his stewardship as the caretaker chairman of the party in the last two years, noting that his efforts have repositioned the party.\n\nBuni had come under fire in recent times over how he managed the cracks in the party, and was almost removed from office by some powerful forces that were allegedly backed by President Buhari in his last days in office through what many had described as a palace coup.\n\nBuni was appointed to steer the affairs of the party after the removal of Adams Oshiomhole from office in 2019. His mandate however was to manage the crisis in the party and thereafter conduct a national convention that will produce a National Working Committee for the party.\n\nBut the convention was postponed several times. However, in his speech last night, Buni attributed it to the larger problems he inherited from a party he said was more polarised then and needed more time to be cured from its internal ailments.\n\nWhile he thanked the President and stakeholders of the party for the support they gave to him in his days in office, Buni boasted that he was \u201cmore confident than ever, that with a population of over 41 million registered members and still counting, APC has the potential and capacity to remain Nigeria\u2019s ruling party and indeed, Africa\u2019s largest political party.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted with your esteemed presence at this epoch-making occasion in the life of our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), as we assemble here for the National Convention, climaxing the transition process which started with the conduct of ward, local, and state congresses. Today, we are going for the zonal and national offices as well as, the ratification of the amended constitution of Africa\u2019s largest political party, the APC.\n\n*As you are aware, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee which l am opportune to chair, is a child of circumstance constituted by the National Executive Committee (NEC), to restructure and reposition the party.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, distinguished personalities, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to quickly reflect on some of the modest achievements recorded by the party under the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee whose tenure is ending today, for us to appreciate how far we have gone in revamping and improving our beloved party.\n\n\u201cUpon assumption of office, the committee embarked on a genuine and all-inclusive reconciliation process to give everyone a true sense of belonging, confidence, and reassurance in the collective ownership of the party.\n\n\u201cWe, first of all, visited some critical stakeholders to engage them in resolving the disputes and other hanging disagreements in the party. While some of these visits were made public, others were done out of the public glare and without media publicity. Similarly, we visited some aggrieved chieftains who sincerely shared their ill feelings with the committee. We spoke to each other frankly, placing party interests above personal interests.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to state that those frank discussions built a new hope in the hearts of the aggrieved persons such that, those who earlier left the party returned back, while those contemplating to forsake the party, never left.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we commenced the assignment, we realized that the problems on the ground had far outweighed our estimation of the time required to resolve the huge problems bedeviling the party. This made the initial Six months dateline grossly inadequate, unrealistic, and not practicable and therefore, the need for extension of more time. Happily, for every extension, we brought in additional values with positive developments into the party.\n\n\u201cHaving reconciled substantial stakeholders, members and groups, the committee commenced membership registration and revalidation exercise, being one of the mandates of the CECPC, to establish the party\u2019s numerical strength for proper planning and mobilization. The exercise provided our new members the opportunity to register as legitimate members of APC with equal rights, privileges, and opportunities, as well as, to give back the ownership of the party to the members, using the bottom-top approach.\n\n\u201cI am glad to state with all sense of fulfillment that the membership registration and revalidation exercise, recorded over 41 million members who registered with the details of their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and passport size photographs. This unprecedented increase in membership from the previous 11 million registered members to over 41 million registered members, provides the party with an added advantage of winning elections in Nigeria with landslide victories\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker Committee, made history with an unparalleled record of high-powered defections into the party. Three serving governors of Ebonyi State, His Excellency Engr. Dave Umahi, Cross River State, His Excellency Dr. Ben Ayade, and Zamfara State, Alhaji Bello Mutawalle, defected along with Millions of their supporters from PDP into the APC.\n\n\u201cI am glad to add that the fortunes of the party were further enriched with the defection of former Speakers of the House of Representatives, former PDP national chairman, member PDP Board of Trustees, several Distinguished Senators and Honourable members of the House of Representatives and state assemblies, and several other heavyweights cutting across all the geo-political zones of the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s Justice Minister, Malami Manipulated Federal High Court To Issue Conflicting Orders On Section 84(12) Of Amended Electoral Act \u2014 Falana",
          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has alleged that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami manipulated the judgement of the Federal High Court in Umahia, Abia State with regards to deletion of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that the AGF alongside some principal officers such as Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, worked behind the scenes to obtain an order by the Federal High Court Umuahia that would keep them in office even if they contest for political offices.\n\nThe controversial section 84(12) of the Electoral Act reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\n\n\nHowever, Malami and the others cunningly sought the deletion of the provision from the constitution in their own favour.\n\n\n\nAlso, President Muhammadu Buhari had, after signing the bill into the law, written the National Assembly requesting that the provision be expunged from the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nBut the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party had on March 2, 2022, filed an ex-parte motion against the Nigerian government at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to stop attempts to tamper with the Act.\n\n\n\nThe PDP also prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining Buhari and other defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act or in any manner withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the said Act pending the resolution of the suit.\n\n\n\nThis was granted on March 7 by the presiding judge, Inyang Ekwo.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, two other suits were filed both in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umahia, Abia State by one Oyewole Bolanle and Nduka Edede respectively compelling the AGF to delete the provision.\n\n\n\nOn March 19, the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nWhile Malami failed to react to the March 7 orders, the Umuahia judgment was recognised as the AGF\u2019s office gave the federal government\u2019s position through the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Umar Jibrilu Gwandu.\n\n\n\nGwandu said the minister would accordingly give effect to the court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\n\n\nBut in a statement on Sunday, Falana pointed out flaws, noting that the two cases filed by both Bolanle and Edede were similar despite being filed in different courts and locations \u2014 confirming SaharaReporters\u2019 story that Malami and others were able to find a judge to do their bidding.\n\n\n\nAlso, Falana noted that Malami, being the defendant in both cases failed to draw the attention of both Ibadan and Umuahia Judicial Divisions of the Federal High Court to the fact that the Abuja Judicial Division of the same Court already gave a verdict with regards to deletion of the section prior to the Umahia court.\n\n\n\nFalana further noted that Malami failed to inform the Umuahia court that the Ibadan Judicial Division of the court had struck out a similar case for want of locus standi.\n\n\n\nHe, however, warned that if the Attorney General goes ahead to delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, he (Malami) would be liable to be committed for contempt ex facie curiae as the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court has restrained him and other defendants \"from enforcing the provisions of the said Electoral Act, 2022 including the provisions of Section 84(12) of the said Act pending the determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\"\n\n\n\nThis is even as the Senior Advocate noted that Malami cannot delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act unless the valid and subsisting order of the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court is set aside, either by the trial Judge or an Appellate Court.\n\n\n\n\n\nFalana submitted, \u201cFrom the foregoing, it is crystal clear that even though the two lawyers who represented the Plaintiffs in Suit Nos FHC/ IB/CS/32/2022: CHIEF OYEWOLE BOLANLE v ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION and FHC/UM/CS/26/2002: CHIEF NDUKA EDEDE V ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION are based in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umuahia, Abia State, the two cases filed by them were similar in every material particular.\n\n\n\n\u201cHence, the two questions formulated for determination and the four similar reliefs sought by their clients in the two cases filed at the Ibadan and Umuahia judicial divisions of the Federal High Court are in pari material.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though the Plaintiffs are different the Attorney-General of the Federation is the sole defendant in both cases. It is doubtful if the similarities in the two cases can be said to be mere coincidence.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Defendant in both cases did not draw the attention of both Ibadan and Umuahia Judicial Divisions of the Federal High Court to the fact that the Abuja Judicial Division of the same Court had on March 7, 2022, restrained himself, President Buhari, National Assembly and the Independent National Electoral Commission from refusing to implement the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeither did the Attorney-General disclose to the Umuahia Judicial Division of the Federal High Court that the Ibadan Judicial Division had struck out a similar case for want of locus standi.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn any case, since the case pending at the Ibadan Judicial Division of the Federal High Court was well reported in the print and electronic media, the Judge sitting in the Umuahia Judicial Division ought to have struck out the fresh case before her as it constituted a gross abuse of court process.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that while the Attorney-General of the Federation pretended not to know about the order of interim injunction granted by the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court, he has announced the plan of the Federal Government to comply with the judgment delivered in the Umuahia case soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, if the Attorney General goes ahead to delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, he would be liable to be committed for contempt ex facie curiae as the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court has restrained him and other defendants from \u2018from enforcing the provisions of the said Electoral Act, 2022 including the provisions of Section 84(12) of the said Act pending the determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cWe submit, without any fear of contradiction, that unless the valid and subsisting order of the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court is set aside either by the trial Judge or an Appellate Court, the Attorney-General of the Federation cannot delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is trite that the Attorney-General cannot choose and pick the orders of the court to obey or disobey. More so, when it is undoubtedly clear that the Attorney-General deliberately set out to manipulate the Federal High Court to issue conflicting orders in a desperate move to annul section 84(12) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt, this is the first time in the entire history of Nigeria that the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation has engaged in forum shopping for favourable orders of the Federal High Court or another Court. It is high time the dangerous manipulation of the Federal High Court was stopped as the nation prepares for the 2023 General Elections.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has alleged that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami manipulated the judgement of the Federal High Court in Umahia, Abia State with regards to deletion of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that the AGF alongside some principal officers such as Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, worked behind the scenes to obtain an order by the Federal High Court Umuahia that would keep them in office even if they contest for political offices.\n\nThe controversial section 84(12) of the Electoral Act reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\n\n\nHowever, Malami and the others cunningly sought the deletion of the provision from the constitution in their own favour.\n\n\n\nAlso, President Muhammadu Buhari had, after signing the bill into the law, written the National Assembly requesting that the provision be expunged from the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nBut the opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party had on March 2, 2022, filed an ex-parte motion against the Nigerian government at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking to stop attempts to tamper with the Act.\n\n\n\nThe PDP also prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining Buhari and other defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act or in any manner withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the said Act pending the resolution of the suit.\n\n\n\nThis was granted on March 7 by the presiding judge, Inyang Ekwo.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, two other suits were filed both in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umahia, Abia State by one Oyewole Bolanle and Nduka Edede respectively compelling the AGF to delete the provision.\n\n\n\nOn March 19, the Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nWhile Malami failed to react to the March 7 orders, the Umuahia judgment was recognised as the AGF\u2019s office gave the federal government\u2019s position through the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Umar Jibrilu Gwandu.\n\n\n\nGwandu said the minister would accordingly give effect to the court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\n\n\nBut in a statement on Sunday, Falana pointed out flaws, noting that the two cases filed by both Bolanle and Edede were similar despite being filed in different courts and locations \u2014 confirming SaharaReporters\u2019 story that Malami and others were able to find a judge to do their bidding.\n\n\n\nAlso, Falana noted that Malami, being the defendant in both cases failed to draw the attention of both Ibadan and Umuahia Judicial Divisions of the Federal High Court to the fact that the Abuja Judicial Division of the same Court already gave a verdict with regards to deletion of the section prior to the Umahia court.\n\n\n\nFalana further noted that Malami failed to inform the Umuahia court that the Ibadan Judicial Division of the court had struck out a similar case for want of locus standi.\n\n\n\nHe, however, warned that if the Attorney General goes ahead to delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, he (Malami) would be liable to be committed for contempt ex facie curiae as the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court has restrained him and other defendants \"from enforcing the provisions of the said Electoral Act, 2022 including the provisions of Section 84(12) of the said Act pending the determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\"\n\n\n\nThis is even as the Senior Advocate noted that Malami cannot delete section 84(12) of the Electoral Act unless the valid and subsisting order of the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court is set aside, either by the trial Judge or an Appellate Court.\n\n\n\n\n\nFalana submitted, \u201cFrom the foregoing, it is crystal clear that even though the two lawyers who represented the Plaintiffs in Suit Nos FHC/ IB/CS/32/2022: CHIEF OYEWOLE BOLANLE v ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION and FHC/UM/CS/26/2002: CHIEF NDUKA EDEDE V ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE FEDERATION are based in Ibadan, Oyo State and Umuahia, Abia State, the two cases filed by them were similar in every material particular.\n\n\n\n\u201cHence, the two questions formulated for determination and the four similar reliefs sought by their clients in the two cases filed at the Ibadan and Umuahia judicial divisions of the Federal High Court are in pari material.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though the Plaintiffs are different the Attorney-General of the Federation is the sole defendant in both cases.

          "text": "Tears. Disagreement. Indignation. These words succinctly summarise the 2022 national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAfter almost 21 months of Mai Mala Buni, Yobe governor-led caretaker committee in charge, the ruling party finally held its national convention on March 26 and all winners were declared and inaugurated on March 27.\n\nWhile the winners are basking in euphoria, the losers most of whom were persuaded to withdraw from the race, are gnashing their teeth and evaluating their future in the ruling party.\n\nCHAIRMANSHIP ASPIRANTS WITHDRAW\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 7,584 delegates from across the country arrived at Eagle Square in Abuja to cast their votes for their preferred candidates in the convention.\n\nUnfortunately, the delegates\u2019 expectations, including those of most of the aspirants, were dashed by the dramatic, perplexing, and unexpected turn of events.\n\nBefore the exercise began, six aspirants for the office of the national chairman announced their decision to step down for Abdullahi Adamu, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s preferred candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTanko Al-Makura, former governor of Nasarawa state; George Akume, ex-governor of Benue; Abdulaziz Yari, former governor of Zamfara; Saliu Mustapha, Muhammed Etsu, and Sani Musa are among the chairmanship hopefuls who reluctantly withdrew from the contest.\n\n\u201cHISTORY-MAKING CONVENTION\u201d\n\nAddressing delegates at the convention, Buhari had described the event as \u201chistory-making\u201d for the APC which had been without a national working committee (NWC) for several months.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate us all for being part of this history-making event and to especially appreciate the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) which has been on a rescue mission under the leadership of His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, the Yobe state governor, for successfully piloting the affairs of the Party in the last 18 months and organizing this Convention to elect a new National Working Committee that will take over from the Caretaker Committee,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE ASPIRANTS SURRENDERED THEIR AMBITION\n\nAfter the event started around 8:45 pm with goodwill messages delivered by various stakeholders including Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives; Ahmad Lawan, senate president; Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, and lastly by Buhari, a wave of withdrawals was subsequently announced by Muhammad Badaru, governor of Jigawa, the returning officer for the election.\n\nAt the session moderated by Badaru, several aspirants for various positions took to the stage to publicly announce their decision to withdraw the race \u2014 only so that they will get a refund for the cash paid for the nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nASPIRANTS FOR WOMEN LEADER ROLE PROTEST WITHDRAWAL\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exercise soon witnessed chaotic moments as a couple of aspirants refused to withdraw from the race.\n\nBetta Edu, former Cross River commissioner for health; Mary Ekpere-Eta, former director-general of the National Women Development Centre (NWDC), and Helen Effiom were all vying for the position of the national women leader. Edu was the consensus candidate for the position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEkpere-Eta vowed not to step down after Alphonsus Eba, the Cross River APC chairman, announced on her behalf that she had withdrawn.\n\nEkpere-Eta took to the podium to counter Eba\u2019s announcement. She said: \u201cI will never and cannot withdraw from the race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHours later, after reportedly being persuaded by Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, Ekpere-Eta bowed out of the race.\n\nHowever, Helen Effiom another aspirant for the office refused to throw in the towel despite several appeals by party chieftains.\n\nThe party opted to let the two candidates slug it out at the poll after hours of futile attempts to reach an agreement.\n\nAfter five hours of voting, Edu was declared the winner with 2,063 votes, defeating Effiom who had 114 votes.\n\nNATIONAL YOUTH LEADER ASPIRANT WITHDRAWS \u2014 BUT IN TEARS\n\nDada Olusegun, a frontline aspirant for the office of the national youth leader, withdrew from the race in a tearful \u201cturnaround\u201d.\n\nEarlier, he had been seen in what appeared to be an argument and reports had it that he had insisted on not stepping down for Dayo Israel who was endorsed as the consensus candidate for the position.\n\nAs persuasion and consultation were on to set the coast free for Israel to be declared the winner for the position unchallenged, Olusegun was seen kneeling before Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, with a group of supporters.\n\nAfter a while, Olusegun appeared on stage and announced his withdrawal from the race sobbing intermittently as his committee of \u201cconsolers\u201d took him off the podium.\n\nBEHIND-THE-SCENE RANCOUR\n\nIt is interesting to know that while the aspirants were taking to the podium to announce their withdrawal from the race \u2014 albeit apparently reluctantly \u2014 most of their supporters behind the stage kicked against the murky horse-trading their aspirants were forced into.\n\nIn a conversation with TheCable, some of the supporters of the aspirants who stood down for the party\u2019s consensus nominees expressed disappointment with the way their candidates were treated.\n\n\u201cAllow the aspirants to test their popularity. How can someone join a party a year ago and is adopted as a consensus candidate but another person who has been there for years is not considered. It\u2019s undemocratic, where is the justice? a supporter of Ekpere-Eta said.\n\nAnother supporter of Ekpere-Eta said the former director-general of NWDC is a founding member of the APC in Cross River state and that it is unjustified for Edu who defected to the APC in 2021 to be adopted as a consensus candidate.\n\nTheCable learnt that some of the national working committee (NWC) hopefuls laughed off the \u201dconsensus arrangement\u201d while some only knew the party had settled on consensus candidates a few minutes before the convention began.\n\nAlso, when Olusegun mounted the podium to announce his withdrawal from the race, his livid supporters could be heard asking him not to.\n\nAdebayo Shittu, former minister of communications, who later stood down for Iyiola Omisore, the consensus aspirant for the position of national secretary, had said at the convention that he was not part of the truce that led to the adoption of the singular candidate for the position.\n\n\u201cMy grievance was the fact that under the used term consensus \u2014 the position I wanted, which I aspired to was given to some other person on a platter of gold,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cAnd I said as a lawyer of 42 years, I\u2019m intelligent enough to know that consensus means conceding to somebody.

          "text": "Tears. Disagreement. Indignation. These words succinctly summarise the 2022 national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAfter almost 21 months of Mai Mala Buni, Yobe governor-led caretaker committee in charge, the ruling party finally held its national convention on March 26 and all winners were declared and inaugurated on March 27.\n\nWhile the winners are basking in euphoria, the losers most of whom were persuaded to withdraw from the race, are gnashing their teeth and evaluating their future in the ruling party.\n\nCHAIRMANSHIP ASPIRANTS WITHDRAW\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 7,584 delegates from across the country arrived at Eagle Square in Abuja to cast their votes for their preferred candidates in the convention.\n\nUnfortunately, the delegates\u2019 expectations, including those of most of the aspirants, were dashed by the dramatic, perplexing, and unexpected turn of events.\n\nBefore the exercise began, six aspirants for the office of the national chairman announced their decision to step down for Abdullahi Adamu, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s preferred candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTanko Al-Makura, former governor of Nasarawa state; George Akume, ex-governor of Benue; Abdulaziz Yari, former governor of Zamfara; Saliu Mustapha, Muhammed Etsu, and Sani Musa are among the chairmanship hopefuls who reluctantly withdrew from the contest.\n\n\u201cHISTORY-MAKING CONVENTION\u201d\n\nAddressing delegates at the convention, Buhari had described the event as \u201chistory-making\u201d for the APC which had been without a national working committee (NWC) for several months.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate us all for being part of this history-making event and to especially appreciate the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) which has been on a rescue mission under the leadership of His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, the Yobe state governor, for successfully piloting the affairs of the Party in the last 18 months and organizing this Convention to elect a new National Working Committee that will take over from the Caretaker Committee,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE ASPIRANTS SURRENDERED THEIR AMBITION\n\nAfter the event started around 8:45 pm with goodwill messages delivered by various stakeholders including Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives; Ahmad Lawan, senate president; Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, and lastly by Buhari, a wave of withdrawals was subsequently announced by Muhammad Badaru, governor of Jigawa, the returning officer for the election.\n\nAt the session moderated by Badaru, several aspirants for various positions took to the stage to publicly announce their decision to withdraw the race \u2014 only so that they will get a refund for the cash paid for the nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nASPIRANTS FOR WOMEN LEADER ROLE PROTEST WITHDRAWAL\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exercise soon witnessed chaotic moments as a couple of aspirants refused to withdraw from the race.\n\nBetta Edu, former Cross River commissioner for health; Mary Ekpere-Eta, former director-general of the National Women Development Centre (NWDC), and Helen Effiom were all vying for the position of the national women leader. Edu was the consensus candidate for the position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEkpere-Eta vowed not to step down after Alphonsus Eba, the Cross River APC chairman, announced on her behalf that she had withdrawn.\n\nEkpere-Eta took to the podium to counter Eba\u2019s announcement. She said: \u201cI will never and cannot withdraw from the race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHours later, after reportedly being persuaded by Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, Ekpere-Eta bowed out of the race.\n\nHowever, Helen Effiom another aspirant for the office refused to throw in the towel despite several appeals by party chieftains.\n\nThe party opted to let the two candidates slug it out at the poll after hours of futile attempts to reach an agreement.\n\nAfter five hours of voting, Edu was declared the winner with 2,063 votes, defeating Effiom who had 114 votes.\n\nNATIONAL YOUTH LEADER ASPIRANT WITHDRAWS \u2014 BUT IN TEARS\n\nDada Olusegun, a frontline aspirant for the office of the national youth leader, withdrew from the race in a tearful \u201cturnaround\u201d.\n\nEarlier, he had been seen in what appeared to be an argument and reports had it that he had insisted on not stepping down for Dayo Israel who was endorsed as the consensus candidate for the position.\n\nAs persuasion and consultation were on to set the coast free for Israel to be declared the winner for the position unchallenged, Olusegun was seen kneeling before Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, with a group of supporters.\n\nAfter a while, Olusegun appeared on stage and announced his withdrawal from the race sobbing intermittently as his committee of \u201cconsolers\u201d took him off the podium.\n\nBEHIND-THE-SCENE RANCOUR\n\nIt is interesting to know that while the aspirants were taking to the podium to announce their withdrawal from the race \u2014 albeit apparently reluctantly \u2014 most of their supporters behind the stage kicked against the murky horse-trading their aspirants were forced into.\n\nIn a conversation with TheCable, some of the supporters of the aspirants who stood down for the party\u2019s consensus nominees expressed disappointment with the way their candidates were treated.\n\n\u201cAllow the aspirants to test their popularity. How can someone join a party a year ago and is adopted as a consensus candidate but another person who has been there for years is not considered. It\u2019s undemocratic, where is the justice? a supporter of Ekpere-Eta said.\n\nAnother supporter of Ekpere-Eta said the former director-general of NWDC is a founding member of the APC in Cross River state and that it is unjustified for Edu who defected to the APC in 2021 to be adopted as a consensus candidate.\n\nTheCable learnt that some of the national working committee (NWC) hopefuls laughed off the \u201dconsensus arrangement\u201d while some only knew the party had settled on consensus candidates a few minutes before the convention began.\n\nAlso, when Olusegun mounted the podium to announce his withdrawal from the race, his livid supporters could be heard asking him not to.\n\nAdebayo Shittu, former minister of communications, who later stood down for Iyiola Omisore, the consensus aspirant for the position of national secretary, had said at the convention that he was not part of the truce that led to the adoption of the singular candidate for the position.\n\n\u201cMy grievance was the fact that under the used term consensus \u2014 the position I wanted, which I aspired to was given to some other person on a platter of gold,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cAnd I said as a lawyer of 42 years, I\u2019m intelligent enough to know that consensus means conceding to somebody. But you cannot concede on behalf of somebody, particularly when you don\u2019t have my instruction. So I was not part of the consensus.\u201d\n\nWhile many of the aspirants who stepped down from the race said they will continue to support the party, the issue of how the party treats loyal members lurks and may be a crisis in the offing.\n\nTheCable had reported that politicians who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling party are now holding crucial positions in the new NWC, leaving foundation members out in the cold.\n\nWHAT IS THE WAY FORWAY?\n\nSpeaking to TheCable Sylvanus Okpe, an APC chieftain from Benue, said disagreement is unavoidable in politics.\n\nHe added that the first duty of the newly-inaugurated NWC members should be to \u201cquickly\u201d reconcile the aggrieved members.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: From dropping out to advocacy -- Hamzat Lawal's transition to politics",
          "text": "On March 12, Hamzat Lawal, the chief executive officer of Connected Development (CODE), turned 35. For Lawal, this is not only a year of exit from youth but also of transition. Marking his birthday with a symposium in Abuja, with the theme \u2013 \u2018The Man. The Journey. The Transition\u2019, Lawal declared that he would be involved in partisan politics going forward. For an activist and a youth and community development advocate over the years, the next phase of Lawal\u2019s life seems to be filled with hopes, big dreams, and equal challenges. In this interview with TheCable\u2019s MAYOWA TIJANI and VIVIAN CHIME, Lawal shares his life\u2019s journey as an activist, dropping out of school multiple times, and future aspirations.\n\nTheCable: This is 35. And officially you have reached the age for exit from youth, going by the age limit of the African Youth Charter. You have been instrumental in youth movements over the years, how would your transition affect your youth advocacies?\n\nLawal: For me, I will still remain a strong voice for youths and young people because now I\u2019m transitioning from being a youth to being a young person. I will be a strong voice for them, I will continue to create a platform for them and provide opportunities for them but I will also leave the space for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, I currently sit on over 17 boards both internationally and locally and I currently chair three of those boards, after I turn 35, I would send resignation to over half of those boards, and I would publicly make a statement on the boards I\u2019m stepping down from and I would recommend [youths]. What I have deliberately done is to invest in younger people so I would recommend younger people from across Nigeria that can take up those positions.\n\nFor me, creating opportunities for young people is exiting the space and leaving it for them, not being there and saying I am an advocate for youth, no. Being an advocate for youth does not mean I have to take their space, and I think youths also need to learn that the older generation would not want to relinquish power or leave the space, you have to take it. But yes, I don\u2019t want other young people and youth out there to struggle to break through, I want to be able to mentor them and guide them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would launch a mentorship program and make it more formal where annually I take some people under my wings, transfer knowledge, guide them, shape them and expose them.\n\nTheCable: With \u2018Follow the Money\u2019 and \u2018Connected Development\u2019, how far will you say you have come in your advocacy and in bringing intervention to communities around Nigeria?\n\nLawal: Thank you! So \u2018Follow the Money\u2019 story, jumping in a bus from Abuja to Gusau was about seven hours and it\u2019s really hot, sometimes it gets to 42 degrees. From Gusau to Anka at that time was three and a half hours with a terrible road. From Anka to Bagega is about four and a half hours. No road, so you either go on a motorcycle, a camel, a donkey or a horse and it is a pathway, so no road. I took a motorbike, getting to Bagega I was covered in dust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo for me, technology played a big role, with my smartphone, I was taking pictures, of course with the permission of community members, doing short videos and of course, I understand basic Hausa because they don\u2019t understand English in the Bagega community in Zamfara state and then coming to Abuja and leveraging on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram aggregating this information that we call data and just launching a campaign with a hashtag that went viral.\n\nFirst, it went from trending on Twitter in less than 48 hours to in less than 72 hours the then president, President Goodluck Jonathan approved the sum of 5.3 million dollars which was close to a billion Naira and that\u2019s how \u2018Follow the Money\u2019 started.\n\nWe ensured we followed the money from the disbursement and ensured it moved from Abuja to Gusau to Anka to Bagega and interventions happened that saved 1,500 children. Before then, over 700 children had died, so it was underreported because in the news report it was saying 400 but when I went underground and I did my fact check it was over 700 children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also had other successes, now you have a tarred access road from Gusau to Bagega, it takes you less than one and half hours to get to Bagega from Gusau, something that took close to nine hours. They now have solar-powered water [boreholes], they have a state-of-the-art primary healthcare center, they have a renovated primary school with a new computer laboratory built for them. Now they have mobile networks, the last time I was there, I tweeted from Bagega.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first time I was there, there was no network, but today, you know, the GDP has increased, they have more businesses in the community, they can communicate with the outside world, they\u2019re more integrated with digital technology and the kids are going to school, they\u2019re healthy.\n\nSo for me, this is just one intervention and it moved from one campaign now \u2018Follow the Money\u2019 is running over 30 campaigns per quarter. So every three months, because now \u2018Follow the Money\u2019 is the fastest growing social accountability movement, we have 8,000 members in African countries but we have 10 chapters, so we have offices in 10 countries that are being led by campaigners and activists. They are running campaigns led by citizens, taking ownership, and ensuring physical accountability, particularly at the grassroots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable: How do you ensure funder\u2019s monies are judiciously used by your NGO and what is your funding system like?\n\nLawal: I\u2019m glad you asked that question. A lot of people have a misconception about grants and donor money. There are what we call donor reporting, donor checks and balances; you have audits, you also have a board that oversights your activities, that approves your budget and also oversights your spending and you retire to.\n\nIt\u2019s not a free-for-all, these people will not give you their money and then you go and sit down, no. You do reports, there are a series of reports, some you do quarterly reports, some you do biannual reports and then you also have to submit your independent audited account, internal and external.\n\nThen every quarter you would face the board and give accounts of programmes, finance, and human resource. So I think there is a misconception but we are heavily regulated, the civil society space, by government, I have received FIRS in my office, they have come and looked at our payroll and they are trying to be sure that we are actually remitting PAYE tax. You think the Nigerian government does not have access to my account?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy accessing grants, it\u2019s not easy accessing funds, there are some donors that after the project they\u2019ve not renewed, so if it was that easy then money would just be coming in. There are times that you have to cut down overhead, that means sacking staff, just because a project has elapsed and they didn\u2019t renew, it\u2019s not easy.\n\nTheCable: About the future, you said you want to be EFCC chairman for 2 years, but the law does not allow civilians like you to become the EFCC chairman, so how do you want to go about that?\n\nLawal: One thing I have learnt over the years with my experience with advocacy, with campaigning, every law is subject to review and amendment. As much as I am passionate to transition to hopefully in the future become the chairman of EFCC, yes currently the law does not allow it because I am not a police officer or I have never been a police officer, and I don\u2019t want to be selfish about it, if the law does not get amended, as long as we see reforms, we see institutional reform, we see results and changes, particularly in financial crime, I think I would find contentment in that.\n\nSo it\u2019s not about me, as much as I am ambitious to become the chairman of EFCC. But I also think, you know before now I have always remained on the sidelines, there is this notion that politics is dirty, that it\u2019s going to make some of us that are successful in other spheres of life stain our credibility and our name and years of efforts of work.\n\nBut who then changes Nigeria? If we as young professionals are looking at politics as a dirty game, where has it taken us, we\u2019ve agonized, we\u2019ve complained, we\u2019ve ranted on Twitter space, on Twitter, on Facebook, nothing has literally changed.\n\nSo for us we are saying we will not remain in the sideline, we will not continue to agonize, we would organize, we would mobilize, educate and bring young people, women and people who live with disability to decide the fate of Nigeria because we must change the political journey of our country at this critical time.",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "Okubanjo to step back from people decisions at Bento Africa",
          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The law aims to allow smaller messaging platforms to access the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the messaging world.\n\nIf it ends up getting implemented by October, this could mean that messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and iMessage could become interoperable.\n\nBasically, you might be able to send messages on WhatsApp to someone on Telegram or unlike the current exclusive use case of the iMessage platform, from iMessage to Facebook Messenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t get too excited yet, though. According to The Verge, \u201cthe language in the press release is unclear on whether the big apps would have to work together.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, today I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nRide-sharing newcomer\u2019s launch in Lagos, and\n\nThe correlation between Right of Way charges and Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\nHytch launches in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, during my compulsory national youth service, to save transportation costs, I hitchhiked part of the way to my office. Not the safest option, but certainly one of the cheapest. Basically, I stood by the side of the road and hailed strange cars going in the same direction I was going.\n\nUnfortunately, due to some stern African parent \u2014 I feel this phrase is tautological \u2014 warnings, I couldn\u2019t continue.\n\nFor Laolu Onifade, the journey to hitchhiking was a little different. Borne out of unpleasant experiences with ride-hailing companies, he got three other friends to join in his desire to build a ride-sharing platform that connects drivers and riders going in the same direction.\n\nOn Friday, March 25, 2022, Hytch \u2014 Onifade\u2019s ride-sharing platform \u2014 was publicly launched and currently operates in Lagos State.\n\nBut how does Onifade hope to ensure user safety and prevent stern African parent warnings? I spoke with him a few days ago, and among other things, we discussed Hytch\u2019s safety measures and plans.\n\nYou can find it here: Ride-sharing newcomer, Hytch is providing a new way to travel, hitchhiking style\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight of Way charges disrupt Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome interesting news: On Friday, March 25, 2022, the Nigerian Federal Government directed state governors to remove Right of Way (RoW) barriers to fast-track the expansion and strengthen the national grid.\n\nWhy? According to the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, issues with RoW has stalled 32 transmission projects across Nigeria worth $137 million.\n\nAn age-long problem: Before now, the federal government has made some inroads into challenges surrounding RoW charges. In 2017, the National Executive Council (NEC), approved a policy, which resulted in an RoW Charge Agreement reached with all the governors of the 36 states of Nigeria.\n\nThis agreement was meant to harmonise charges across board but has yet to materialise enough changes in the system with some states increasing their tariffs.\n\nRoW charges affect the overall amount telcos spend in laying optic fibre and eventually affect the cost of calls and Internet data. Now, it appears it could also be affecting electricity transmission as well.\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen federal government directives on the issue, and it remains to be seen if any changes will occur.\n\nMeanwhile, for your reading pleasure: When calls and data could get cheaper for Nigerian states that slashed RoW charges\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nWoke up to Elton John\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart ringing in my head and went on an oldies path for the rest of the day.\n\nSome lessons on patience, albeit from a footballing perspective.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I understand the concept yet, but this video about understanding dimensions was an interesting watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

Let\u2019s say your office is in Ikeja, you live in Surulere, and your colleague who also lives in Surulere has a car. So, you tend to get a ride with them, sometimes paying for fuel, saving you quite a bit of money that you\u2019d have spent on transport.\n\nBut what if you could hitch a ride with a stranger going in the same direction? Doesn\u2019t sound too safe, right? Especially if you\u2019ve been following the recent news on social media about insecurity on some ride-hailing and even government-owned transport systems.\n\nWell, Laolu Onifade thinks he might have found a sweet spot with his newly launched ride-sharing startup, Hytch.\n\nBut what does Hytch do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaolu Onifade, Hytch Founder\n\nAccording to Onifade, Hytch connects car owners and passengers going in the same direction. Using our earlier example, say you\u2019re trying to get to Berger from Surulere, all you have to do is launch the app, find drivers within a 2-3km radius going in that direction and, voila, you\u2019ve \u201chytched\u201d a ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar to the defunct GoMyWay, the ride is shared with three other riders going in the same direction, making the fare cheaper\n\nModelled after popular ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber, Hytch doesn\u2019t own any of the cars on the platform and only onboards drivers, with certain safety restrictions \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 built in to prevent mishaps.\n\nHytch takes a 15% commission off every ride and operates a cashless payment method. All users \u2014 drivers and passengers \u2014 have a wallet, so passengers are automatically debited the amount for the trip when it ends.\n\nThe idea for Hytch was birthed between 2019 and 2020, following Onifade\u2019s frustrations with ride-hailing platforms.\n\n\u201cI have encountered this problem myself moving around and with Uber being so expensive; I\u2019ve had this problem with Uber since 2019/2020. I noticed that Uber and Bolt were getting so expensive and I used to wonder, how about I just hitch a ride?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be in someone\u2019s car? Sometimes when I\u2019m in an Uber that\u2019s costing me say \u20a65,000, I don\u2019t mind sharing the ride with three other people in the back seat going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nRoping in his friends, Femi Omoniyi (CTO), Olawale Adeyeye (Chief Imagineer), and Kemdirim Akujobi (Product and Design Lead), they began building Hytch in 2021.\n\nAfter several months of beta testing, which saw them onboard 200 people, Hytch comes out of stealth mode today, with the app available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring user safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week Friday, March 18, 2022, this tweet by twitterer, @_kimaura set Nigeria\u2019s Twitter streets ablaze.\n\nso guys, i got robbed on wednesday night at ikoyi by my bolt driver, he took my phone, my cards, my ID, all my money and savings, lemme tell you how it happened. I ordered a bolt ride going to lekki, after i got into the ride which was a heavily tinted car and we started \u2026 \u2014 KIMBORO\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf51 (@_kimaura) March 18, 2022\n\n@_kimaura described being robbed by the Bolt driver who took her phone, debit cards, and IDs, among other things. Barely a month after the tragic death of Oluwabamise Ayanwole on a BRT in Lagos, it was enough to cause an uproar, with many people narrating various incidents.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @ade_IDD, narrated how she was almost kidnapped by a Bolt driver whose appearance was different from the picture on the platform. He told her that he was using his brother\u2019s account because his had been blocked.\n\nSo @Boltapp_ng i have strength today. I ordered a ride from school to my house yesterday Friday 18th of march and i got a driver. He came and i confirmed car type and number plate and i put my stuff in the car and he started the ride. \u2014 AdaUgo.\ud83e\udd84\u2728Busiswadede. \ud83e\udd75 (@ade_IDD) March 19, 2022\n\nThankfully, she got to safety, before anything untoward happened.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, another user, @shugadupri reported encountering the same driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while Bolt\u2019s support team acknowledged some complaints on Twitter, it is yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nTechpoint Africa asked Onifade how Hytch hopes to ensure user safety.\n\nOnifade explained that user safety is provided for both drivers and riders.\n\n\u201cFor drivers, we verify driver\u2019s licence. For riders, you have to take a picture at the moment. So that means, the same picture you take at the time that you are signing up is what the driver is going to use to recognise you. So you have to make sure you\u2019re taking an actual picture or else the driver is not going to pick you up.\n\n\u201cYou also have to put in your legal first and last name while signing up.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that it is an actual picture, Hytch has partnered with Nigerian digital compliance and security company, IdentityPass, plugging in an API that determines whether it is a human face.\n\nFor added security, the driver and rider are sent a pin which both users must confirm on the app before a trip commences. This could also prevent issues of drivers starting trips before arriving.\n\nLike other ride-hailing/ride-sharing companies, Hytch provides a panic button that enables users to alert family and friends when they are in danger.\n\nWhere a rider receives a streak of three bad ratings, they are automatically blocked from using the app, although they can be reinstated. The driver would have to reach out to get the account unblocked after an investigation is carried out.\n\nOnifade said there are currently plans to include National Identification Number (NIN) verification as a security measure; however, he agrees this could be limiting for users with no NIN.\n\nThere\u2019s still much for the startup to do with plans to eventually include interstate travel and as Onifade laughingly told Techpoint Africa, the ability to book a seat on a private jet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuidax, Africa founded cryptocurrency exchange, unveiled its brand ambassador on Tuesday, March 22, 2022.\n\nAfter giving his opening remarks, Buchi Okoro, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder, Quidax, briefly talked about the brand, what they do, and what they have achieved over the years.\n\nHe said that Quidax makes it easy for users to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.\u201d There is a lot of exclusion that happens because we are Nigerians, Africans.\u201d Crypto is the solution. Quidax was built to solve issues affecting accessing funds and transferring them easily for Africans.\n\nQuidax On CoinMarketcap\n\nOver the years, Quidax has grown to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in Africa and the first African exchange listed on CoinMarketCap. By May 2021 they had processed over 3.2 billion dollars in transactions in less than three years and were awarded Business Day\u2019s 2021 digital assets company of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Year, New Quidax\n\nBuchi mentioned that improvements are constantly made to their platform through customer feedback, with the new price alert feature on the platform being a notable example. Quidax has also found a way to engage users to learn crypto on its platform and recently launched Quidax academy to train crypto beginners.\n\nAnswering how secure the platform is, Buchi said they have a custody solution that includes fund insurance; every fund in Quidax is insured. Also, there is a 13-man team constantly working on securing the platform from attacks and a three-factor authentification (3FA) feature that helps to confirm the user\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuidax and Don Jazzy\n\nBuchi said that they started the #TheQuidaxCall recently, aiming to help put crypto in front of more people. \u201cThe point is to help preach the gospel of crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nBuchi introduced Michael Collins Ajereh, professionally known as Don Jazzy as a new member and brand ambassador of the Quidax family.\n\nWhen asked why crypto and why he feels it is important, Don Jazzy said he tries his best to stay ahead of the curve and know what is next to avoid being left behind in a fast-moving world. He added that he wants to get more people into crypto as he believes it is the future.\n\nDon Jazzy, who started his crypto journey during the Covid19 pandemic in 2020, said he finds crypto relatively easy to use and transfer money to various world parts.\n\nDon Jazzy also expressed his opinions on Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their many use cases. He sees NFTs becoming a thing in the music industry, and he highlighted the other use cases like property ownership in the metaverse.\n\nBuchi said their choice in selecting Don Jazzy was because he is very easy to relate to and approach, and he is genuinely interested in crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling it a match made in heaven, Buchi said, \u201cAt Quidax, we believe that learning crypto should actually be fun. Learning crypto should be something you can relate to, and Don Jazzy exemplifies and shows what it means to be a Quidaxian.\n\nAlso in attendance at the unveiling event were Uzo Awili, Quidax Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and CO-Founder, Morris Ebieroma, Quidax\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and CO-Founder, members of the Quidax staff; Miss Techy, Money Africa, members of the media, among others.\n\nQuidax is an African-founded cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies. Quidax also enables fintech companies to provide cryptocurrency-related services to their customers.\n\nSocial Media Links\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/QuidaxGlobal\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/QuidaxGlobal\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/quidaxglobal\n\nQDX Token Community (Telegram): https://t.me/QDXToken\n\nQuidax Global Community (Telegram): https://t.me/QuidaxGlobal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s oil sector walked to a cliff\u2019s edge",
          "text": "Upon his appointment as the 18th Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) in July 2019, Mele Kyari, set upon achieving a production target of 3 million barrels per day (bpd). For a country struggling to produce 1.4 million bpd, this seemed like an ambitious goal until you realise that the target in 1992 was to raise production to 4 million bpd.\n\nThe story of how Nigeria\u2019s sprawling oil industry \u2013 which once accounted for the highest foreign direct investments, which was the prime career choice for many bright children and the lubricant that oiled both infrastructure and sleaze \u2013 drifted to the edge of the cliff mirrors how Africa\u2019s biggest economy suffered a bruising fall.\n\n\u201cWithin the past 30 years I have been in the industry, the decline I have seen in the sector year after year was caused by not putting the right people in the right places,\u201d said Udeimoh Itseuli, a former chairman of NNPC and chairman of Dubril Oil Company Limited, an indigenous operator.\n\nItseuli told BusinessDay that in the early days of oil production in the 1970s when Nigerians began to acquire technical skills, those who wrote government regulations and worked in NNPC were experienced professionals with technical competence, having worked in the private sector.\n\nAnalysts say the skill level has since dropped significantly. Despite being one of the largest producers on the continent, Nigeria has no university that has built a strong research and innovation faculty to serve the oil industry.\n\nThe decline, they said, started with the influx of quacks with the \u2018right connections\u2019 or who came from the \u2018right part of the country\u2019. They were given oil wells they didn\u2019t know how to develop and ran government agencies they were ill-prepared for.\n\nThis accounts for why the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) governing operation in deepwater, where most of Nigeria\u2019s oil is now produced, provided for reviews every five years or once oil price rose above the base price of $20 a barrel, but they failed to initiate any such review for decades.\n\nThe delay in passing the Petroleum Industry Bill created decades of uncertainty during which the International Oil Companies (IOCs) began to look elsewhere, and they held back investments. This effectively shut off new discoveries, and production infrastructure was not maintained. The result is that today Nigeria cannot produce enough to meet its reduced quota from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nRead also: To salvage Nigeria\u2019s oil industry, professionals must be allowed to run it \u2013 Itsueli\n\nWhile Nigeria battled above-the-ground problems including instability at the helms of the poorly managed NNPC, which in a 10-year period had seven GMDs, the oil industry was experiencing an earthquake in the form of energy transition, and those running it think it is only an aftershock.\n\nThe effect of poor leadership is seen in the country\u2019s inability to save or invest oil windfalls, protect energy assets against sabotage, making Nigeria, one of the world\u2019s highest-cost producers.\n\nA new wave of security threats has brought Nigeria\u2019s energy sector to its knees, as local operators without the capacity to absorb as many shocks as the IOCs lament that crude theft has reached heights previously unimaginable.\n\nIn a season where its global peers are leveraging the current oil price of over $100 per barrel to raise quick cash to prop up their national economies, fund their budgets, and attract investments, Nigeria is hemorrhaging cash, paying wasteful subsidies on petrol, and fighting off crude oil thieves.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala, former finance minister, said in 2012 that Nigeria was losing about 400,000 barrels of crude oil per day, translating to over $1 billion monthly, to thieves.\n\nA decade later, it has morphed into a heist with some companies reporting that more than 90 percent of their crude is stolen from pipelines before it reaches the terminal.\n\n\u201cBefore, we were dealing with pocket oil thieves who were only stealing buckets of crude oil; now it\u2019s an organised crime syndicate,\u201d said Bolaji Ogundare, a senior executive in an indigenous oil company.\n\nInsecurity became pervasive in the oil industry when militants operating in the Niger Delta ramped up attacks on oil fields and terminals in 2016, pushing production below 1.4 million bpd.\n\nIn response, President Muhammadu Buhari initially threatened to deal with them but backtracked and continued the presidential amnesty programme, instituted by late former President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua in 2009.\n\nOil theft seems to have worsened, with sources saying it is now an industrial-scale enterprise involving well-connected government officials, security personnel, and local communities.\n\n\u201cHow can we be losing over 95 percent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000 barrels of crude oil daily, instead, it receives less than 3,000 barrels,\u201d Tony Elumelu, who owns huge stakes in Tenoil Petroleum & Energy Services, said in a series of tweets on March 17.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crude oil pipeline network has collapsed completely as IOCs with a foot in the door have abandoned the maintenance of the pipeline network.\n\nThe large scale of the problem is seen in Aiteo\u2019s decision to abandon a pipeline it acquired for $1.2bn and transport its crude by barges. Moving crude by barges adds up to about $15 a barrel, compared to the cost of moving crude by pipeline which is $2.5 a barrel.\n\nElumelu\u2019s company pumps about 40,000 barrels of crude daily into the pipeline but only manages to export 7,000 barrels daily at the terminal.\n\nThe total value of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil stolen between January 2021 and February 2022 is about $3.27 billion (representing N1.361 trillion at the official exchange rate of N416.25 to the dollar), the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission said in a presentation to the Oil Producers Trade Section, as well as the Independent Petroleum Producers Group at a stakeholders event on crude oil theft on March 24.\n\n\u201cThe sophistication of the engineering involved points towards a high degree of sophistication and technology, as well as the distribution. I think we\u2019ve just got to be honest and accept that this is not theft but organised criminal activity,\u201d said Richard Laing, managing director of ExxonMobil Nigeria.\n\nThe IOCs said it would impact their ability to meet the government\u2019s target of reducing production costs to $10 per barrel by the end of the year. Oil operators are taxed after expenses; hence, high production cost eats into tax returns.\n\nCrude oil theft is adding a distance to Nigeria\u2019s ability to meet the OPEC quota of 1.7 million bpd in March 2022 from its previous target of 1.70 million bpd in February and 1.68 million bpd in January.\n\nNigeria has not met its quota since July last year, according to data from Refinitiv, an American-British global provider of financial market data said.\n\nAccording to an NNPC presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee meeting for March 2022, the national oil company and its partners lost over 2.2 million barrels of crude oil worth about $213 million, based on February\u2019s average Brent price of $97.\n\nAustin Avuru, the founding MD of Seplat Energy Plc, has called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector. \u201cThere has to be a deliberate policy-driven return to the traditional onshore/shallow water terrains,\u201d he said while calling on the government to match slogan with action.\n\nBeyond oil theft, operators say court judgments awarding billions of dollars to communities further place a strain on oil companies when these leaks are now often caused by sabotage.\n\nMany are unaware that a judgment debt against the oil companies means that the Federal Government, which has a 60 percent stake in joint venture operations, will pay the greater share, said Itsueli.\n\nThese problems have forced the IOCs to divest from onshore and shallow-water assets. NNPC\u2019s demand for preemption rights, even though it is poorly managing its current assets, is expected to add a new dimension to the problems.\n\n\u201cThe future will belong to independent producers, with IOCs leaving onshore assets; now is the time for Nigeria to incentivise them to turn the situation into an opportunity,\u201d said Adebowale Adeniyi, senior manager, Oil, Gas & Power Group at Andersen Tax.",

Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000 barrels of crude oil daily, instead, it receives less than 3,000 barrels,\u201d Tony Elumelu, who owns huge stakes in Tenoil Petroleum & Energy Services, said in a series of tweets on March 17.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crude oil pipeline network has collapsed completely as IOCs with a foot in the door have abandoned the maintenance of the pipeline network.\n\nThe large scale of the problem is seen in Aiteo\u2019s decision to abandon a pipeline it acquired for $1.2bn and transport its crude by barges. Moving crude by barges adds up to about $15 a barrel, compared to the cost of moving crude by pipeline which is $2.5 a barrel.\n\nElumelu\u2019s company pumps about 40,000 barrels of crude daily into the pipeline but only manages to export 7,000 barrels daily at the terminal.\n\nThe total value of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil stolen between January 2021 and February 2022 is about $3.27 billion (representing N1.361 trillion at the official exchange rate of N416.25 to the dollar), the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission said in a presentation to the Oil Producers Trade Section, as well as the Independent Petroleum Producers Group at a stakeholders event on crude oil theft on March 24.\n\n\u201cThe sophistication of the engineering involved points towards a high degree of sophistication and technology, as well as the distribution. I think we\u2019ve just got to be honest and accept that this is not theft but organised criminal activity,\u201d said Richard Laing, managing director of ExxonMobil Nigeria.\n\nThe IOCs said it would impact their ability to meet the government\u2019s target of reducing production costs to $10 per barrel by the end of the year. Oil operators are taxed after expenses; hence, high production cost eats into tax returns.\n\nCrude oil theft is adding a distance to Nigeria\u2019s ability to meet the OPEC quota of 1.7 million bpd in March 2022 from its previous target of 1.70 million bpd in February and 1.68 million bpd in January.\n\nNigeria has not met its quota since July last year, according to data from Refinitiv, an American-British global provider of financial market data said.\n\nAccording to an NNPC presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee meeting for March 2022, the national oil company and its partners lost over 2.2 million barrels of crude oil worth about $213 million, based on February\u2019s average Brent price of $97.\n\nAustin Avuru, the founding MD of Seplat Energy Plc, has called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector. \u201cThere has to be a deliberate policy-driven return to the traditional onshore/shallow water terrains,\u201d he said while calling on the government to match slogan with action.\n\nBeyond oil theft, operators say court judgments awarding billions of dollars to communities further place a strain on oil companies when these leaks are now often caused by sabotage.\n\nMany are unaware that a judgment debt against the oil companies means that the Federal Government, which has a 60 percent stake in joint venture operations, will pay the greater share, said Itsueli.\n\nThese problems have forced the IOCs to divest from onshore and shallow-water assets. NNPC\u2019s demand for preemption rights, even though it is poorly managing its current assets, is expected to add a new dimension to the problems.\n\n\u201cThe future will belong to independent producers, with IOCs leaving onshore assets; now is the time for Nigeria to incentivise them to turn the situation into an opportunity,\u201d said Adebowale Adeniyi, senior manager, Oil, Gas & Power Group at Andersen Tax.",

          "text": "The reality of International Oil Companies\u2019 (IOCs) departure from the largest oil patch in Africa is ceding the space to independent companies \u2013 a development that will test Nigeria\u2019s ability to craft policies that will make its oil industry attractive for investments.\n\nOil industry professionals who spoke to BusinessDay said the decision to leave Nigeria had been taken years ago when it emerged that the country was crimping the space for operators.\n\nThey say Nigerian government officials\u2019 cavalier attitude towards industry operators, rampant crude theft and sabotage, inability to quickly enact regulatory and fiscal reforms, insecurity and disrespect for contract sanctity, and pressure exacted by climate change activists are some of the key factors driving the exodus of IOCs.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian oil industry from 2022 will be taken over by independents, whether they are Nigerian or foreign independents because the IOCs are not coming back,\u201d Uduimoh Itsueli, a former chairman of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and chairman of Dubril Oil Company Ltd, said in an interview.\n\nItsueli, however, said the independents do not have the clout of the IOCs.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to craft the policies so that it can encourage these ones who do not have the same clout as the IOCs. We need to change how we do business. We need to grow our own independents,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria is doing the very opposite. The cash-strapped government is foraging for cash with a desperation that borders on mania, leading to rampant harassment of industry operators by various organs of government.\n\nIndigenous oil firms tell BusinessDay that various state governments, local government agencies, and lawmakers embark on revenue drives in the form of levies, new taxes, and constant demands for audits and documentation about companies\u2019 accounts with so much tenacity that it looks like a shakedown.\n\n\u201cSomebody sent a letter to our Benin office saying that we do not have a permit to produce water we use commercially. But we don\u2019t even have a water plant; we don\u2019t sell water. They wrote threatening to take action. We simply called their number to say we have a borehole for water we use internally. They said, \u2018Oh, write a letter to us to that effect,\u2019\u201d Itsueli said.\n\nThe same week the company received a letter from the National Assembly, requesting details of its transactions with the NNPC going back 20 years as well as bank records and the company\u2019s books. The committee wanted 20 copies of each and two flash drives as well as the company\u2019s officials to physically bring them to Abuja.\n\nHowever, Dubril Oil is a sole risk company with no transactions with the NNPC.\n\nItsueli said these were the sort of things that needed to change. While the IOCs have a large staff strength and huge departments and can respond to government officials\u2019 harassment, sometimes appealing to their ambassadors to intervene, the independents do not have such clout.\n\nRead also: IOCs lament threat to business as Nigeria loses $3.27bn to crude oil theft\n\nSince they are nimble and efficient, independents have small staff strength and even smaller tolerance for official ineptitude. A relapse to the old ways by the Nigerian government will trigger an exit faster than a 100 meters dash.\n\nDelay in granting approvals and taking decisions, a constant feature of the Nigerian government engagement with oil sector operators, (it took 22 years to write an oil law), sometimes weaponised to whip erring operators in line, will be a blunt tool after the exit of IOCs.\n\nFollowing plans for a new marginal field bid rounds, the erstwhile regulator, Department of Petroleum Resources, revoked the marginal fields awarded to seven firms, including Associated Oil & Gas Limited and Dansaki Petroleum Limited, operators of Tom Shot Bank Marginal Field; Bayelsa Oil Limited, operator of Atala Marginal Field; Independent Energy Limited, operator of Ofa Marginal Field; and Del-Sigma Petroleum Nigeria Limited, operator of Ke Marginal Field.\n\nOthers are Sogenal Energy Limited, operator of Akepo Marginal Field; Sahara Energy Limited and African Oil & Gas Limited, operators of Tsekelewu Marginal Field; Bicta Energy and Management Systems Ltd, operator of Ogedeh Marginal Field; and Goland Petroleum Limited, operator of Oriri Marginal Field.\n\nThe firms went to court and secured a judgment restraining the government from auctioning the fields they said they had invested over $100 million to develop.\n\nSince the judgment was secured in 2020, even after another bid round in 2021, the matter has remained unresolved.\n\n\u201cWe have written letters upon letters, but we have not heard anything,\u201d Aderele Afolabi, founder of Dansaki Petroleum Ltd, told BusinessDay. \u201cPlease keep me informed if you hear anything,\u201d he urged this reporter.\n\nIn a serious country, an investor would not ask a reporter the latest details about his investment with the government.\n\nPrior to Lekoil\u2019s corporate troubles, Lekan Akinyanmi, the company\u2019s CEO, had told BusinessDay that the greatest risk facing local oil firms was not raising capital, wasn\u2019t human resources, wasn\u2019t even community agitations but the slow pace of regulatory decision-making.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the government now is how to make the sector more attractive for investors, tackle vandalism in the Niger Delta and incentivise operators,\u201d said Adebowale Adeniyi, senior manager, Oil, Gas & Power Group at Andersen Tax.\n\nGovernment officials who shout themselves hoarse over ease of doing business, operators say, behave as if they get paid by how thorough they are in frustrating businesses.\n\nOperators say the tone of communication by government regulators and lawmakers with oversight over committees, many with scant knowledge of the sector they pretend to superintend, is often punitive, laced with threats.\n\nSome operators report an aversion for private companies reporting huge profits, forgetting that when private companies succeed, the economy gets bigger, they employ more people, pay more taxes, get involved in more Corporate Social Responsibility and relieve the government of some burden to focus on more urgent areas.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Chief Executive officer, Edo State Flood Erosion and Watershed Management Agency, Dr. Tom Obaseki and the Chairman, Edo State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commission EDSOPADEC, Pastor Kennedy Osifo have called on Edo citizens and indigenes both home and abroad to support the investment drive of the Governor Godwin Obaseki led government in flood and erosion prevention , waste management and infrastructural development.\n\nThey made the appeal during the fifth session of the talk to the People Webinar series with the theme, \u201cIntergovernmental Collaboration as a necessary condition for infrastructural development in Edo State organized by Edo Media Connect Forum in collaboration with the Edo state Ministry of Communication and Orientation at the weekend.\n\nWhile chronicling the mandate of his agency, Dr. Tom Obaseki disclosed that under the NEWMAP project , the agency has developed and demonstrated new flood remediation techniques which commenced with the identification of fifteen intervention sites across the three senatorial districts of the state and the focus is on channeling water off infrastructures, land and property assets.\n\nAccording to him, the agency also built on the storm water approach through the identification of several catchments like the Uwelu catchment and the development of these catchments in phases across 3 senatorial districts and so far this storm water approach has been successful in Ama, Emotan Estate and Ogiso areas.\n\n\u201cLiaison officers have been employed in every local government to detect and document flood prone areas in Edo state for prompt action by the agency and so far the officers have identified 202 flood prone areas.\n\n\u201cThe agency\u2019s project also extends to removal and disposal of plastics and other waste that militate against the effectiveness of inbuilt channels for floods and erosion control in Edo state. The publicity materials for public engagement were made available at this session.\n\n\u201cNEWMAP and the Edo state flood agency is leveraging its multi-disciplinary collaboration to invigorate the inter agency discussions and collaboration and these deliberations have identified the fragmented nature of land transactions as one of the factors militating against erosion and flood control in Edo and these discussions have necessitated the development of an improved four strategic pillars in its new road map for a re-invigorated agency\n\nDr. Tom Obaseki stated that Governor Obaseki is very serious about tackling the menace of flood and gulley erosion in the state, adding that the Upper Adesuwa area that was not passable for over thirty years, you can drive through today, at Ogiso area, the link road between Osunde street and Ikpoba slope by the prayer ground is now motor able.\n\n\u201cFor the first time we are having a storm water solution to fully drain the Government Reservation Area, that was never there before and the storm water solution for Ambrose Ali University which has helped to preserve about three major structures that were about to be engulfed by gully erosion.\n\n\u201cThese are in addition to what we have done at Eguosa Estate and Ogiso area. The governor is interested in solving these problems and he has demonstrated it and flooding will be a thing of the past,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EDSOGPADEC Chairman, Pastor Osifo who re-echoed the developmental strides of the 14 years old Commission as an interventionists agency which has provided infrastructural intervention to the oil producing local government areas of Edo State which includes Ikpoba Okha, Ovia and Orhionmwon local government areas disclosed that the commission has designed 140 link roads across the three local governments awaiting the approval of His Excellency to kickstart.\n\nHe said the agency got a marching order from the governor to provide oversight of communities and report to the government cases where host communities suffer any detriments from action of oil companies and to this end the commission has been involved in the construction of roads, such as the 105 km Benin \u2013Abraka road, 17 km Ajoki road to divert passing Koko to get to Edo communities, concrete jetty in Ologbo, provision of speed boats especially for Orhionmwon river to support transportation and security needs of the communities where the river overflowed its bank.\n\nHe further disclosed that compensation was paid in Abudu in cases of detriments to host communities, construction of Erediauwa road, completion of police stations at St. Saviour, Ogororio, Dumez, and Ogbine police station which is being renovated to improve security and safety in Ikpoba Okha, Ovia, Orhionmwon communities and the water ways.\n\nAccording to him, the commission purchased facilities and equipment to improve security such as the acquisition of gun boats, procurement of speed boats, re-asphalting of 9.8 km University of Benin road, construction of magistrate courts in Udogbo and Okada communities, development and maintenance of NYSC Orientation camp in Edo state, development and redesigning of 37 health care centers and human capital development and training of 164 persons.\n\nHe said the governor has given the directive that all the health centre\u2019s in the oil communities must be World Health Organization standard and he expressed optimism that when the projects are approved and completed the people would benefit immensely from good health care.\n\nTo ensure transparency of funds allocated to the commission, the EDSOGPADEC Chairman said there is effective control of funds appropriated to the commission which is a total of 40% from the 13% derivation funds that accrues to the state by ensuring transparent disbursement after approval by the governor of Edo State\n\n\u201cDetailed monthly report on expenditure to the governor of the state and efficient and effective deployment of funds for infrastructure and human capital development across the oil producing communities are made by the commission,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Barr. Andrew Adaze Emwanta in his vote of thanks thanked God for making the event a success, the moderators Dr. Joseph Ohens, Anne Obozuwa and the two guests for their superlative impact they are making to Make Edo Great Again through their agencies.\n\n\u201cThe chairman, Planning Committee, Dr. Ikpenmosa Uhumuavbi, the Special Adviser to the Governor on strategy for creating this platform to let Edo people know what the government is doing and particularly our Governor for creating the open government initiative that allow those of us in the communication sector to relate back what government is doing to Edo people. Sovereignty lies in the people and they deserve to know what government is doing.\n\n\u201cOur next institutional topic will revolve around the institutional reforms and I expect the whole lot that has happened in the transformation of the Civil Service will be one of those areas that will be discussed. We hope to be bringing up the Head of Service to tell us about the e-government platform.\n\n\u201cI want to thank all of us the participants, staff of Ministry of Communication, the Nigerian Observer and Edo Broadcasting Service for making the Webinar series a success.\n\nIn his brief remarks, Mr. Ehi Braimah thanked the governor for the able team he has put together in his cabinet and looking forward to the next Webinar session he noted that the civil service reform is a big deal where His Excellency has done a lot of work and he cannot wait for that day to let Edo people know what is happening in that sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The infection wasn\u2019t so high and the mortality wasn\u2019t as bad as we get from malaria or other diseases.\n\n\u201cWhat really affected us was the disruption of livelihoods and with the lockdowns, a lot of small businesses were seriously affected and but the availability of technology as a response sprung up new opportunities for small businesses in particular.\n\n\u201cIn terms of our healthcare response, we realized the opportunities for investment in the healthcare space and the participation of the private sector in healthcare delivery. Before now, the bulk of healthcare investment was left to the government, even though the private sector is a key provider of healthcare services.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cFor small and medium businesses because they had been drained of capital as a result of the lockdown, it further showed the importance and necessity to reinvest in that segment of the economy. So, small businesses became a viable sector to invest money because most of them began to use technology for service delivery and production.\n\n\u201cThis opened an opportunity for other key investments that came out as a result of the COVID-19, which is investments in technology and tech startups.\n\n\u201cAs a lot of our young people began to invest and take opportunities in the tech space, we found companies outsourcing work to young people in Nigeria and Edo State, with many of our young people earning in foreign exchange for writing codes and programmes for companies abroad. So, that\u2019s another area we found significant investment.\u201d\n\nOn ensuring food security, the governor stated, \u201cThe Ukrainian war, for me, has created a real alarm for our food systems. With the increase in food prices, particularly, wheat, staples and grains, and the rise in energy prices, we as a government, have realized that we now have to put in a lot of resources and time in agriculture, and large-scale agricultural projects.\n\n\u201cFortunately, in Edo State, we have started investment in palm oil and have rolled out programmes where we could bring in serious investment into large scale oil palm production as the trigger for large scale investment in agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the opportunities that we see in the next three years is to first secure our food supplies by food production and then utilize technology and focus on smaller businesses,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nAlso, Murito said Africa\u2019s young population, which covers a third of the world\u2019s population, should be empowered to fill the future jobs locally and internationally.\n\nEarlier, Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said Qatar looks forward to exploring ways to partner with Africa and discuss business opportunities that can empower the continent.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201c I sat at the back of a man\u201d, wrote the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy \u201cchoking him and making him to carry my weight; yet, I assured him and I assured myself that I wish I could lighten his burden\u201d.\n\nWhy not climb down the man\u2019s back if you are indeed concerned about mitigating the suffering you have inflicted.\n\nIn all of the modern history of human conflict, there has not been a war more unjust and more anchored on the power dynamics of tyranny as this nauseating invasion.\n\nYet, there are some persons who continue to see this tyranny-let-loosed as a fallout of NATO\u2019s alleged promise not to expand eastward.\n\nWe are all creatures of emotions, we are as regulated by primordial instincts and idiosyncratic biases as by reason. This is why some folks can, in all honesty, attempt to defend such immoral and barbaric invasion. Miguel de Unamuno , the Spanish existentialist philosopher was right when he argued that reason is not man\u2019s towering crown but emotion. The man who philosophizes is a man of flesh and blood who feels more than he thinks. Reason and logic can never cause him to stray a hair\u2019s breath from his biases no matter the soundness of the logic or the strength of the facts.\n\nThere are despots who would have us believe that the era of an open society with its democratic ethos is over. They insist, blindly, that the pace of modern states cannot allow for democratic debates and consensus choices in running a nation. That democracy is inherently weak, time consuming and structurally unsustainable. That is what the Xis and Putins of this world would have us believe.\n\nIt was the great Scottish psychiatrist, R.D. Laing that warned us that the \u201crange and extent of the things that we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. That because we fail to notice that we are failing to notice, there is little we can do to change, until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.\u201d\n\nThe danger of liberal democracies today is that inhabitants of the West are failing to notice that the freedom they presently enjoy and the democracy that underpins it, is in grave danger. They fail to see that democracy is a fragile thing and that the condition upon which God has given liberty to men, is eternal vigilance.\n\nTrump assaulted democracy from within and Putin is now attacking it from without and yet , there are good-natured people who would make case for both men. The argument today is that democracy and freedom are out of sync with the realities of modern states. At least, that is the unspoken creed of Xi and Putin and it is sad that some otherwise reasonable folks would strenuously attempt to justify such a brazen bare-faced invasion by a brute on any grounds even when the groundlessness of Putin\u2019s invasion yearns deeper than Grand Canyon. The West may not be as saintly as they claim but I tell you a truth : should the light of democracy be extinguished by the likes of Putin, mankind would spiral back to the Hobbesian state of nature where life was solitary, nasty, brutish and short.\n\nIt is sad to notice that were Hitler alive today and undergoing his monstrous pogrom, some folks would still make case for him: blame international Jewry for their perceived greed or America for some perceived mischievous globalization or the Poles for not willingly genuflecting before the German war machines.\n\n\u201cRemove law and justice,\u201d warned St. Augustine, \u201cand what are states but gangs of criminals on a large scale\u201d. It is fidelity to a set of moral code and decency that largely defines a civilised society. President Biden was on point when he described Putin as a thug: is anything more thuggish than sending armed mob into your neighbour\u2019s house without any provocation?\n\nThe point here is that America, for its faults and failings, remains the beacon of freedom, justice and opportunity for the world. It is only a fool that throws the baby away with the bath water. Democracy may not be the elixir that transforms base metals into gold, but it is definitely the best platform that guarantees that the light of justice, freedom , opportunity is not extinguished from the midst of men.\n\nDoes it not portend universal danger that one man could rally a military power like Russia into war?\n\nDoes it not bother a sane man that there are no institutions inside Russia that can checkmate or even mildly regulate Putin?\n\nShould one man possess such powers?\n\nIs it not indicative of tyranny and a failed system that one man should wield such powers?\n\nIt is only the most naive amongst us that would readily equate the West with total moral rightness. Frantz Fanon may have his points when he said that anytime he searches for man in the technique of the West , he sees only a succession of the negations of man and a avalanche of murders. However, the institutional guardrails of Western democracies are the best indicators of the survival of the human species.\n\nAbsolute power, said Woodrow Wilson, is what precedes the destruction of human liberty. Putin is pure, unadulterated evil and trying to defend him amounts to demons in search of logic and trying cosmos out of chaos.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOsazuwa Osahon Daniels, Esq.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "China\u2019s financial hub of Shanghai launched a two-stage lockdown of its 26 million residents on Monday, closing bridges and tunnels, and restricting highway traffic in a scramble to contain surging COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe snap lockdown, announced by Shanghai\u2019s city government on Sunday, will split the city in two roughly along the Huangpu River for nine days to allow for \u201cstaggered\u201d testing. It is the biggest COVID-related disruption to hit the city.\n\nWhile residents east of the Huangpu were confined to their homes, those in the west stockpiled groceries and other essential goods as they prepared for a similar fate starting on April 1, with delivery services overwhelmed and supermarkets running low on supplies.\n\n\u201cMany wholesale markets are now closed,\u201d said Bi Yingwu, a 50-year old stallholder. \u201cSome vendors are reluctant to buy in vegetables. If we cannot get vegetables from wholesalers or the wet market is closed, we are finished.\u201d\n\nThe lockdown order marks a turnaround for Shanghai\u2019s authorities, which as late as Saturday denied the city would be locked down as it pursued a more piecemeal \u201cslicing and gridding\u201d approach to try to rein in infections. read more\n\nWu Fan, a member of Shanghai\u2019s expert COVID team, said recent mass testing had found \u201clarge scale\u201d infections throughout the city, triggering the stronger response.\n\n\u201cContaining the large scale outbreak in our city is very important because once infected people are put under control, we have blocked transmission,\u201d she told a briefing, adding that testing would be carried out until all risks were eliminated.\n\nShanghai said earlier this month that its daily testing capacity was around 3 million, but Chen Erzhen, a doctor in charge of a city quarantine facility, warned it still might not be enough to outpace the rapid spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cWhen case numbers reach a certain level, the difficulty of relying upon previous staff deployments increases by a large degree,\u201d he told government newspaper Liberation Daily, adding that the new lockdown should at least ensure the \u201cstillness\u201d required to bring the outbreak under control.\n\nThough still low by global standards, Shanghai recorded a record 3,450 asymptomatic COVID cases on Sunday, accounting for nearly 70% of the nationwide total, along with 50 symptomatic cases.\n\nNationwide, there were 5,134 new asymptomatic and 1,219 symptomatic cases on Sunday,the health authority said in its regular bulletin.\n\nDISRUPTIONS\n\nAs a major engine of China\u2019s economy, Shanghai has been trying to heed President Xi Jinping\u2019s call to minimise the impact of COVID controls on businesses and people\u2019s lives.\n\nWu told a briefing on Saturday that Shanghai could not be locked down for long because of the important role it played in the national and even global economy.\n\nBut following Sunday\u2019s about-turn, mass testing has disrupted transport, healthcare and a wide range of economic activities, with citywide land sales also halted on Monday.\n\nShanghai\u2019s Public Security Bureau said it was closing cross-river bridges and tunnels, and highway tollbooths concentrated in the city\u2019s east until April 1.\n\nThe bureau said traffic controls would be implemented on highways into and out of the city, and people leaving would have to show a negative nucleic acid test taken within the previous 48 hours.\n\nShanghai also said on Sunday it would suspend public transport, including ride-hailing services, in locked down areas. It also ordered the suspension of work at firms and factories, exempting those offering public services or supplying food. Some hospitals also suspended services as they release staff and other resources to assist with mass testing.\n\nU.S. automaker Tesla is suspending production at its factory, located in a district impacted by the first stage of the lockdown, for four days, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, however, said operations at its Shanghai factories were normal.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "PDP, Afenifere Knock Buhari Over Kaduna Airport Attack",
          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, on Sunday criticised the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for Saturday\u2019s invasion of the Kaduna International Airport by bandits. PDP said the development was a clear confirmation that the command and control structure of the country\u2019s security under Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) had collapsed.\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives equally expressed shock at the brazen invasion and takeover of the airport by terrorists. The caucus, in a statement by its leader,\n\nHon. Ndudi Elumelu, called for urgent and comprehensive investigation into the circumstances leading to what it called an apparent compromise of security at the airport, which paved way for the breach.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the alarming invasion of the airport by terrorists at a time outlaws, kidnappers, and marauders had taken over the highways and railways heightened security concerns and fears that nowhere was safe in the country under APC.\n\nAccording to PDP, \u201cThe refusal and failure of Buhari and the APC to take action on the airport attack but continued to jamboree in Abuja in the name of a national convention reveal and confirm that the Buhari administration has conceded sovereignty over parts of the country to terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe main opposition party said Buhari\u2019s nonchalant disposition to the grave security challenge was an indication that his administration was \u201cunable, unwilling and or complicit in this particular attack as well as various other acts of terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nPDP stated that it was \u201cindefensibly suspicious that while an international airport in the country was under attack by over 200 terrorists, with many Nigerians being held hostage and traumatised, President Buhari and the APC continued in their carnival in Abuja without acknowledging or expressing concern.\u201d\n\nIt wondered, \u201cIs this not a case of \u2018Buhari fiddles while Nigeria burns?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe party also said, \u201cThe APC government has failed, become numb to violence against our citizens, and can no longer perform its primary duty under Section 14 (2)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), which provides that \u2018security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe party argued that Buhari\u2019s failure to address the Kaduna airport attack was consistent with his characteristic abdication of duty at critical times, recalling how in January, the president cancelled his scheduled visit to Zamfara State, a state it claimed was daily traumatised by terrorists.\n\nPDP alleged, \u201cBy that action, Mr. President allowed shared sovereignty with terrorists over a part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This acquiesce emboldened the terrorists to now expand their control to the international airport in Kaduna, ostensibly with the possibility of using it to import arms and ammunition as well as coordinate terrorist activities in our country.\n\n\u201cOne of the main features or determinants of sovereignty is the ability of an authority to impose taxes, enforce collection, control commercial activities as well as exit and entry points, including airports.\n\n\u201cUnder President Buhari, terrorists have established sovereignty in substantial parts of the country, especially in the North-west and North-east regions, where terrorists execute laws and impose penalties, collect taxes, control commercial and transportation activities and now take control of an international airport with grave negative consequences to our national image in the world.\n\n\u201cOur country has never had it this bad with such a weak, uncoordinated, and clueless president with an inhumane, visionless and propaganda-driven political party like the APC.\u201d\n\nPDP stressed that Nigerians should rally round its members in their mission \u201cto rescue the nation from the precipice and restore the unity and security of her people.\u201d\n\nOn its part, Afenifere stated that the airport invasion by suspected terrorists was another indication of the deteriorating security situation in the country.\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, frowned on the incident, which happened on the very day the ruling APC was holding its national convention in Abuja. It warned that some people seemed to be bent on re-enacting the Afghanistan situation in Nigeria.\n\nThe group called on all those who believed in freedom, peaceful co-existence, personal liberty, true knowledge, and progress to rise up and ensure people who should act acted promptly.\n\nAfenifere listed some security infractions that took place between Friday and Saturday in parts of the country and regretted that it was as though the country was at war, especially, in those areas where the unfortunate incidents occurred.\n\nAmong the incidents cited by the Yoruba group were the sacking of communities in Kaduna, Niger, and Enugu states by terrorist, leading to loss of lives, burning down of property, and forceful takeover of people\u2019s possessions.\n\nAccording to Afenifere, \u201cIt is a matter of serious concern that these security infractions happened at a time that government kept assuring us that it was on top of the situation. Some of these attacks by terrorists even occurred in broad daylight, that of Kaduna airport and that of Enugu, for instance.\u201d\n\nIt asserted that for terrorists to have the audacity to attack an airport, despite all the available security apparatus, meant there was hardly anywhere safe in the country.\n\nAfenifere maintained, \u201cThe federal government should immediately allow states to set up their own police forces, empower the existing security agencies, and stop treating terrorists with kid gloves. These must be done immediately so that Nigeria does not go the Afghanistan way.\u201d\n\nThe House Minority Caucus called for an urgent investigation to discover the remote and immediate circumstances leading to the security breach at the Kaduna airport.\n\nThe lawmakers said the horrific development was another frightening commentary on the apparent collapse of national security and intelligence gathering coordination under the APC administration.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe Minority Caucus is deeply concerned and alarmed by the manifest lack of capacity by the APC administration to secure our nation to the extent that a strategic international airport in our country could be invaded and taken over by terrorists. Airports, especially international airports across the world, are usually highly secured areas. Therefore, the circumstances that allowed for the invasion of the Kaduna International Airport speak volumes about the failure of the APC administration.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the airport at the time when our roads, railways and communities are being overrun by bandits, kidnappers and invaders has heightened fear across the country as well as sent a very worrisome signal to the international community regarding the safety of our airports and the worsening insecurity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur caucus urges the federal government to immediately beef up security in all our airports and other public convergence facilities in our country so as to forestall a re-occurrence of such terrifying attack.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja",
          "summary": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, on Sunday criticised the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for Saturday\u2019s invasion of the Kaduna International Airport by bandits.\nPDP said the development was a clear confirmation that the command and control structure of the country\u2019s security under Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) had collapsed.\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives equally expressed shock at the brazen invasion and takeover of the airport by terrorists.\nThe lawmakers said the horrific development was another frightening commentary on the apparent collapse of national security and intelligence gathering coordination under the APC administration.\nTherefore, the circumstances that allowed for the invasion of the Kaduna International Airport speak volumes about the failure of the APC administration.",
