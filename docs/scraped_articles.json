          "text": "Former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has said a political solution is still being pursued concerning the case of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe IPOB leader, who is facing charges bordering on terrorism and treason, is currently in the custody of the Department of State Services.\n\nSome Igbo leaders had last year visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the State House in Abuja to seek Kanu\u2019s release. This is amidst calls for a political solution to Kanu\u2019s case.\n\nDuring the visit, Buhari told them that an unconditional release of the IPOB leader runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nThis is as he stated in a recent interview with Channels Television that Kanu should defend himself in court for peddling false information about his regime while he was overseas.\n\nReacting, Ekweremadu, in an interview with Dream FM, Enugu, said he doesn\u2019t think Buhari ruled out a political solution to Kanu\u2019s case.\n\nThe Senator said, \u201cPolitical solution in the Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s matter is still very feasible. I also watched the Channels Television interview and I don\u2019t think Mr. President ruled out a political solution. In fact, I would have been surprised if he said he would just release Nnamdi Kanu because there is independence of every arm of government, including the judiciary. There are procedures.\n\n\u201cI recall that it was exactly Mr President\u2019s response when I led a delegation of the South-East Caucus of the Senate to see him on the Nnamdi Kanu issue in November 2016. But ultimately we kept reaching out and dialoguing until we had a political solution, which resulted in the judiciary granting Mazi Nnamdi Kanu a bail because ultimately, everything will come to the judiciary because every arm of government is independent.\n\n\u201cSo, we will keep working on a political solution, nevertheless. We will keep engaging the government, just as we will continue to appeal to our youth and people to ensure the stability and prosperity of our region.\u201d\n\nHe said a feedback is being expected from government concerning the political solution being pursued.\n\n\u201cIn line with the political solution, which the South East Caucus of the National Assembly is quitely pursuing, I led a delegation of some Igbo leaders like the Deputy Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Secretary-General, Amb. Okey Emuchay; and Bishop of the Methodist Church of Nigeria and Co-Chair Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace,\n\nBishop Sunday Onuoha.\n\n\u201cAs usual, I deliberately didn\u2019t want to make it public because it is a quiet service we are rendering to Ndigbo and the nation. But the DSS eventually made it public in one of their statements. So, to answer your question, yes, I did lead a delegation to interface with the Kanu and the authorities. We had useful conversations. We have equally made some requests and we are waiting for a feedback from the government to make progress,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Amara Ezem-Wallace, Oluchi Elechi and Mary Tombiri-zero\n\nDa Brown besties \u2014 Mary Tombiri-Ero, Oluchi Elechi, Amara Ezem Wallace\u2014 pay special tribute to the Jujuman of Nigerian sports\n\n\n\nEbewele was a man who meant different things to those that came in contact with him. Some saw him as a no-nonsense, confrontational and abrasive man.\n\nYet some others saw him as a kind, magnanimous and friendly individual whose primary concern was about satisfying the needs of others. The latter group believe his altruistic nature ignited his rebellious element whenever he identified negative maneuverings by officials, who, in their bid to shortchange athletes, wanted to cut corners.\n\nBrown Ebewele would never give in to such manipulations and would fight the devil to its knees. As an athlete, he fought and won many battles against sports officials who dreaded him. As a coach, and sports administrator, late Ebewele won many hearts as he made athletes\u2019 welfare a priority.\n\nAccording to some of his former athletes, Coach Brown saw them beyond their sporting needs.\n\n\u201cHe was a mentor, a father figure and a friend who demonstrated so much love and care to his wards.\u201d\n\nCoach Brown left his mark in the sands of time.\n\nBelow are special tributes to late Coach Brown Ebewele by three of his numerous stars who passed through his tutelage and guidance, Dr Mary Tombiri-Ero, Oluchi Elechi and Amara Ezem-Wallace aka \u201cAmara dede\u201d.\n\nDa Brown Besties, their adopted name delighted Brown Ebelwele. Below are their tributes to the man who coached them and mentored them.\n\nHe was a sports servant, my friend, mentor, brother, father and the Cowboy of Nigerian sports \u2014 Dr. Mary Tombiri-Ero\n\nWithout God, Coach Brown, I wouldn\u2019t have earned an athletic scholarship\n\nRest easy and goodbye to my Coach Brown, Hero, Godfather, Brother, and Friend with anincredible Life of Love, Honesty, Protection, and Compassion for all his athletes.\n\nI was blessed at a tender age to be spotted by Coach Brown Ebewele in 1983 during an Inter-House Sports competition on the grounds of Command Secondary School Jos in Plateau State Nigeria.\n\nAs a student of Ahmedu Bello University Zaria and an employee of Kano State Sports Council, Coach Brown dedicated his time, money, passion for success of his athletes.\n\nHe followed through, nurtured, molded, and helped me develop the skills, mentality, and competencies that I needed to succeed in my athletic career. He made me understand that coaching gets under the surface, helping one to break barriers and achieve the best.\n\nCoaching for him was unlike supervisory part of leadership, but relational and highly personal. Being an athlete of Coach Brown, whether on the tracks or after my track career was a privilege. It was life changing.\n\nWithout God and Coach Brown, I would not have earned an athletic scholarship to further my athletic career and education in the United States of America. I would not have possibly been an Olympian without Brown. I would not have also bagged a Doctorate degree if Brown didn\u2019t show me the way.\n\nHis foundation for me led me, triggered many successes, trail blazing, you may say.We had several fights during training with Coach Brown. We escaped motor accidents while travelling for competition from Kano through Zaria to Lagos, Port Hacourt, Ilorin, Bauchi\u2026etc., and even experiences with the Police encounters.\n\nI witnessed the day Coach Brown was locked up in the police cell for defending his athletes. My Coach was, is, and forever will be Brown Ebewele. He died on the eve of 2022. Even though he had been sick for a while, it took me by surprise. I thought he was immortal.\n\nHe used to tell us \u201cyou can do this, go kick some butt\u201d. He would close his eyes when I was on the starting block and open them about 30meters after the gun in all of my 100meters races and scream \u201cGo Mary Go Mary!!!\u201d Coach Brown celebrated his athletes when they won any competition and birthdays.\n\nI remember in 1994, while training for the commonwealth games in Stuttgart Germany, and it was my birthday, Coach Brown coordinated a hush hush money contribution from the athletes in camp to organise a party for me. But he was so excited for the turnout and revealed the secret to me even before the party and asked me to keep it secret.\n\nI thought that was the height of his trust for me. Coach Brown was honest and forthright to all his athletes. He was loud on what needed to be changed. He was inspirational and worked hard to make the environment conducive for improvement. He didn\u2019t look at what you could be, he looked at the present reality.\n\nHe was always managing crisis, planning, ready for the worst. He made training rigorous, uncomfortable for his athletes. He believed that when you create chaos, then your athletes will value peace. He had the ability to recognize talent and work on the person.\n\nHe was a sports servant. And so many times, he proved me right, and he would go back to his stubborn vibrant self. As I moved on and on to achieve other purposes in life, we still stayed in touch. He went from being my coach, to mentor, father, brother and to my friend. As great as he was, he was a better friend and brother.\n\nHe encouraged me to marry, and he participated in my marriage celebration. He was excited I married from Edo to a man he called home boy, and even hosted a reception to honour my marriage.\n\nOn Fashion, Coach Brown dress code always made total statement of a Cowboy. He is and still theoriginal Cowboy in the Nigerian Sports. He encouraged us to be stylish in our appearance on track. His cowboy fashion and style were adopted by few of his ex-athletes in the United States (Myself, Amara Ezem-Wallace and Oluchi Elechi), we call ourselves \u201cDa Brown Besties\u201d. He loved the name.\n\nWe chatted mostly via WhatsApp video group calls. We wanted to give back to Coach Brown, who had given so much to us. We tried to help. We had plans to celebrate and honour our Coach Brown as a Legend in 2020. We informed him, and he was excited. He chose Lagos for venue.\n\nWe had event planner to put our plans to action and then BOOM! Covid-19 happened in 2020. Few months into year 2021, he agreed to our plan to celebrate him in the month of July 2022. As plans grew stronger our Coach Brown revealed to us, he had Cancer. We were struck with sadness and fear of the unknown.\n\nWe had plans to relocate him to the USA for better treatment, but his Doctor at University of Benin Teaching Hospital advised otherwise and administered aggressive treatment plan. We assisted with his treatment in the last stages of the illness.\n\nWe formed prayer sessions and fasting for our dear Coach Brown. We encouraged that he gave his life to Christ as his personal savior. With so much happiness, he gave his life to Christ! He was born again.\n\nTop Coach Brown Ebewele \u201cJujuman\u201d left the world on the eve of year 2022, knowing that we loved him so dearly. And going by his character, touching of lives, he certainly left this world much better than he found it.\n\nCoach Brown has graduated to Heaven! Heaven has received another ANGEL! Rest easy and Goodbye to my Coach Brown, Hero, Godfather, Brother, and Friend with anincredible Life of Love, Honesty, and Compassion for all his athletes.\n\nAdieu my Coach Brown, till we see again.\n\nWe \u2018ll continue to celebrate his legacy \u2013 Oluchi Elechi\n\nI was privileged to be discovered by the great Coach Brown in 1991, as a student of University of Ibadan, and after that my life changed for the best.\n\nCoach Brown ensured they picked me from campus in Ibadian instead of making me travel alone to meet him and the other athletes in Lagos for mobile track meet. Coach Brown taught me and the rest of his athletes the importance of hard work. Coach Brown saw the best in all of his athletes.\n\nHe fought for the truth even when sometimes it cost him dearly. I love you, coach Brown.I remember when I made the Nigeria team, my coach was very happy. He told me we would have to double our training sessions. Training as an hepthatlet is not a joke. It led us to fight as always.\n\nThese experiences with Coach Brown made me tough and disciplined.I will miss you, Coach Brown! A lot of people sometimes did not understand Jujuman, maybe because of his uprightness and passion for people\u2019s success, but it is okay for those of us who did, and we are forever grateful.One of my greatest honors is being one of Coach Brown\u2019s athletes.\n\nCoach Brown fought cancer, but in the end, he lost the battle because God called him home. We all have a validity date on earth.Coach Brown was a Legend, and we will celebrate his legacy. No other coach can be compared to Coach Brown. His uniqueness is, was, and still outstanding.\n\nThank you, jujuman, for giving me my first real job with Kano Sports Council. Thank you for making an hepthalet. Thank you, Coach Brown. Because of you, I furthered my education up to a masters degree. I will forever be grateful.\n\nI love you, jujuman man!Rest on till we meet again.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s God first, my parents and then Brown\u2014 Amara Ezem-Wallace\n\nCoach Brown was in no way a perfect man but he was my hero. I am not sure where I wouldhave been without my Coach Brown. I always say God first, my parents and then Coach Brown.\n\nI am the person that I am today because of them. It Seems like yesterday when Coach Browndiscovered me at secondary school track meet held in university of Lagos. I was never thefastest or anywhere near being the fastest, but my coach Brown saw the potential in me,and the rest was history.\n\nMy God! Coach Brown believed in his athletes even when we didn\u2019tbelieve in ourselves, especially his female athletes. Coach Brown was so proud of us. He wouldalways remind us that nobody was better than us. Coach Brown, my hero, the coach who would fightyou because he wanted the best for you and from you. Coach Brown will do everything he could to make sureyou achieved your set goals.\n\nI remember when I got my visa in December of 1991 to come to theUnited States with a track scholarship, not sure who was happier, myself or coach Brown. Hewas so happy that he took possession of my international passport for safe keeping on a triptill we got to Lagos, and he gave it to my senior sister.\n\nOnly my coach Brown would do such because he was very protective of his athletes. I will never forget how he made sure his girlswere fashionable. He would always ask \u201cwhere are your sunglasses\u201d in every track meet. My God, how I miss our jujuman.\n\nI remember in year 2000 before the Sydney Olympics trials inLagos, I was injured and I told him I wasn\u2019t going to come to the trial, his response was \u201cyes,you are coming and not only that, you will make the team.\u201d Boy, was jujuman right?\n\nHe gave me confidence and boosted my self-esteem. None of that would\u2019ve been possible without his lovefor his athletes. To nurse my injury, after each practice he would make me take a torturing ice bath treatment and he would sit with me to make sure I was ok. I love you coach Brown!!\n\nWho can forget our big fight that led to my nickname \u201cAmara Dede.\u201d Oh boy, only coach Brown would fightyou and turn around and give you nickname. I remembered after one hectic workout session withCoach Brown, he added sessions because he was mad at me, and I complained \u201cI no dey do anything, I don tire.\u201d\n\nCoach Brown ridiculed me saying \u201cevery time I no dey do that or I no dey do this! That was how my nickname Amara Dede originated. Our dear Coach thought us the importance of education, and not just track.\n\nHe advised us that after your track career is over, your education is what will help shape your life, for that, I am forever grateful to Coach Brown. I enjoyed the luxury of his protection and guidance shown us.\n\nHe fought for his athletes and he never backed down or stood aside for injustice. That was what made him outstanding from others. Cancer is evil, but my hero gave cancer a hell of time, he fought hard.\n\nThe most important thing is that Coach Brown has completed his purpose on this earth and the good Lord has called him home. Regardless of all what we planned, we cannot question God.\n\nI am blessed to be part of Jujuman\u2019s journey. I love my coach Brown, but God loves you more, and you are at peace. You will live in our hearts forever and we will celebrate you like the legend that you are.\n\nThank you sir, I love you forever my sports father. Sleep easy in peace.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Marie-Therese Nanlong\n\nThe Jos Field Office, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, NMDPRA has debunked the insinuation by the Plateau State Government that petrol is being hoarded in the State, saying the product was not available but efforts are being intensified to make it available.\n\nNMDPRA also urged the government not to carry out the mandate they don\u2019t have as it is only its office that is mandated to license and monitor activities of petrol stations in the country.\n\nIt would be recalled that on Thursday, the Secretary to the Government of the State, SGS, Professor Danladi Atu in a statement in Jos said it \u201cobserved with great concern the activities of some filling stations hoarding petroleum products with the view to create artificial scarcity\u2026,\u201d called on the Management Committee on Road Traffic Administration and Vehicle Inspectors to \u201cgo round all filling stations to ensure that this act is forestalled\u2026\u201d\n\nProfessor Atu also directed a task force to \u201cseal off any filling station found to be hoarding the products and auction same\u201d to use people.\n\nReacting to the development, the Operations Controller, Jos Field Office, Ahmadu Fagge and his team went round petrol stations in Jos North, Jos South and Bassa local government areas and assured motorists the mild scarcity was as the result of nonavailability not hoarding.\n\nAccording to him,\u201d\u2026 We know there is no hoarding in the State but unavailability of the product because of the spike of commuters during festive season. People are passing through the State, we envisaged this in the past three weeks that is why we have been on surveillance each day to see that no one hoards the product.\n\n\u201c\u2026There is an issue which was raised by the State Government about sealing of stations, that is not their mandate, the NMDPRA has the mandate to license stations and to monitor them in the country, with due respect to the State Government, we are on top of the situation. Between yesterday and today, we have received about 1.6million litres of petrol so the issue of nonavailability is easing out. Citizens should not engage in panic buying, the product is now available.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Manager with Dipdat petrol station along the Bukuru expressway, Gabriel Norbert confirmed that there is no need to worry saying \u201cWe are not selling because we don\u2019t have but we are expecting the product. We had a challenge because our truck broke down on the way, hopefully, by next week, we will have enough product to dispense to the buyers.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026.As Blue Diamond holds AGM, honours staff\n\nBy Cynthia Ahaiwe\n\nChairman of Blue Diamond Group, Mr. Festus Mbisiogu, has said that for businesses to survive current economic climate, there must be orderliness and adherence to laws governing them.\n\nHe cautioned that the absence of rules in businesses could lead to chaos, especially unproductivity.\n\nIn addition, he urged companies to ha\n\nve a good debt recovery system to avoid having a delinquent debtor list\n\nthat will end up as bad debt.\n\nMbisogu, who is the founder of the group with presence across continents, said this during the group\u2019s Eight Annual General Meeting in Lagos.\n\nAt the event , which was attended by directors and top management staff of the Blue Diamond Group, the organization reviewed its 2021 business plan, presented 2022 business plan, elevated and honoured staff who were exceptional last year in their departments, presented its 2022 budget, which had provisions for Corporate Social Responsibility,CSR, business expansion and other areas of operations.\n\nThe company\u2019s accountant, Mr. Charles Isika, who made the budget presentation, said the budget incorporated the various targets assigned to all the sections including the revenue expected from the sales of their different products.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Obinna Gerald, was elevated to the position of Group IT Manager while Mr. Henry Mbagho was promoted to the post of Operation Manager.\n\nAlso, the Punctuality Award went to Ms. Blessing Ekenta.\n\nThe company is known for shipping, production of PVC pipes, aluminium roofing sheets, and bullet proof doors among other construction materials.\n\nIn a speech titled: Business Process Re-engineering, said businesses shouldn\u2019t be afraid of competition, saying it brings out the best in a brand.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhy are you in business? Do you have a strong vision, purpose or passion for being in business? This will go a long way to affect how far you go because a lot of people just go into business for many wrong reasons like we have examined previously in this module. It takes a vision to\n\nkeep strategizing and moving on; it takes a strong purpose to stay focused and avoid distraction; it takes strong passion\n\nto pay the price and make the sacrifices necessary for business success. If your reason for being in business is not tenable but fickle and flimsy, you will not able be to handle the responsibilities and face the challenges.\n\nCompetition\n\n\u201cCompetition is good for business but has led to the closure\n\nof many businesses because they have been forced out of the market by competition. Competition brings out the best in you. Competition attracts attention to your industry. Competition should be expected in business. Don\u2019t be afraid of competition. Don\u2019t say the market is too crowded, and don\u2019t take competition for granted, because they can edge you out.\n\nBe creative and innovative to win over competition. You can take over a segment of the market largely ignored by others. You can approach the same market with a different strategy. No matter what, just realize that competition in business is real, and they can make you fail. You cannot succeed in business without spiritual power, so you must be ahead of your competitions by drawing from the Creator\u2019s divine power. Where there is no order, there will be disorder and chaos.\n\n\u201cAs a business, there are rules of engagement and laws to abide by. To ignore, disobey or flout those laws will lead to\n\nfailure. Statutory obligations like taxes, annual returns etc must be in order so as not to run foul of the law and risk failure\n\n\uf076 Moral laws of integrity, equity, justice etc. must be in order, or else you face challenges that will bring you down.\n\n\uf076 Spiritual law of sowing and reaping must also be put in order. Staff obligation and obligation to customer must also be in order.\n\n\u201cWhen you do all of these, you need to do it in an orderly manner, you will be okay, but if not, it can lead to failure.\n\nExperience\n\n\u201cServing others before stepping out on your own is vital.\n\nSubmitting to mentoring in your area of business is vital. Getting training and experience in whatever you want to do\n\nis vital. A lot of people fail in business because they have no\n\nexperience of how to do business, or are ignorant of the trade secrets in the business they go into. Every business\n\nhas trade secret and industry secrets that are not known to\n\njust anyone, and you don\u2019t discover these secrets as a surface operator.'\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cTo owe money and be unable to pay is trouble.\n\n\u201cTo be owed money and be unable to retrieve it is trouble.\n\n\u201cTo sell on credit without getting your money back is trouble.\n\n\u201cTo buy on credit without being able to pay is trouble.\n\nSome companies are only rich on paper, and when the chips are down, they sink because of the amount of their\n\nfunds tied down in bad debt. You must have a good debt recovery system to avoid having a delinquent debtor list\n\nthat will end up as bad debt.\u201d\n\nAt the event, the company also reiterated its commitment to the delivery of quality products and services to its teeming customers globally.",

          "text": "Sylvester Oromoni\n\n\u2022CP Odumosu insists cause of death natural\n\n\u2022Says aggrieved persons should go to court; Coroner Inquest begins today\n\nBy Evelyn Usman\n\nCommissioner of Police , Lagos State Police Command, AIG Hakeem Odumosu, yesterday, advised those who are not satisfied with the autopsy and Toxicology reports on the late Sylvester Oromoni ,to visit the Coroner Inquest which will begin today in Lagos, to register their grievances or seek redress in the court.\n\nHe warned that the Police would not fold their hand and allow any act of of omission that could threaten the peace in Lagos State .\n\nREAD ALSO:Gunmen attack Imo police station with explosives\n\nBesides, Odumosu, maintained that the command on its part, had concluded investigation into the death of the 12 -year old Junior Secondary School 2 student and found the three House masters and five students earlier arrested in connection with his death, not culpable of allegation of murder.\n\nBriefing journalists on the update of the command\u2019s investigation, yesterday, at the conference room of the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, Odumosu, disclosed that the Command\u2019s findings and the second autopsy revealed \u201c marked pallour of organs, pneumonia(infection of the lungs), infection of the liver and kidney as well as the heart. These infections emanated from the ankle infection described earlier in the report.\n\n\u201cMicroscopic section also confirmed these findings: death was caused by Septicemia, following infections of the lungs and kidneys arising from the ankle wound. Death was caused by Septicemia, following infections of the lungs,and kidney, arising from the ankle wound.\n\n\u201cNo evidence of blunt false trauma in his body . The findings in the Oesophagus and stomach are not compatible with chemical intoxication. Death in this case is natural.\n\nDespite these and the following legal proceedings, the case file was duplicated and sent to the Director of Public Prosecution,for legal advice.\n\nLegal advice however indicated that there is no prima facie case of murder, involuntary manslaughter and/or malicious administering of poison with intent of harm against the students and house masters. Hence they can not be prosecuted. They were all released on bail\u201d, he stated.\n\nGiving a detailed account of how the investigation started, he recalled that a formal complaint was received on December 2,2021, via a petition by V. O Grant & Co, and signed by A.E Afole et Al, and dated December 1,2021,.\n\nHe explained that \u2018 The DPO Maroko was immediately directed to carry out preliminary investigation into the incident , notwithstanding that the incident was not reported at any police station.\n\nSame day the petition was received, DPO Maroko commenced preliminary investigation by visiting Dowen College on a fact finding mission. However, due to the seriousness of the incident and the dire need to carry out diligent investigations , the State Criminal Investigation Department ,SCID, was directed by me to take over investigation of the case with immediate effect.\n\nIn compliance with this directive, the SCID Panti, took over the case on December 10,2021 and continued investigation in earnest.\n\n\u201c In the course of investigation, eight suspects were arrested. They included three house masters of the college and five students who were said to have been mentioned by the deceased before his death.\n\nThe suspects were : Ansel Temile,14; Michael Kashamu, 15; Kenneth Inyang , 15; Favour Benjamin,16 and Edward Begue,16, while the house masters were: Valentine Igbokwe, 45; Ahmed Bariyu,52 and Adesaya Olusegun,42.\n\nA remand warrant dated December 7,2021, was obtained at the Yaba Magistrate Court to enable the police detain the suspects for 21 days , in the first instance while investigation continued\n\n\u201cOn December 9,2021, all the parties , including the deceased family, the school management and witnesses , were interviewed by me at the Command headquarters, Ikeja.\n\nDuring the open interview, it was unanimously agreed that another autopsy should be carried out where pathologists from all parties will be present. Investigation was extended to Delta State and Abuja.\n\nI will like to state here that investigation revealed that same case was reported at the Area Command, Warri, Delta State, on December 1,2021. It has also been established that a postmortem examination was initially carried out on December 2,2022, by a consultant pathologist, Dr Clement Vhriterhire, of the Central Hospital, Warri ,Delta.\n\nThe result of the first autopsy dated December 10,2022, attributed cause of death to acute lungs injury, due to chemical intoxication in a background of blunt force trauma.\n\nHowever, Toxicology screening was recommended and also carried out . While waiting for the result of Toxicology, another autopsy was ordered by the Corona Magistrate in Lagos because of the status of jurisdiction.\n\nThe corpse was therefore moved with armed police escort from Delta State to Lagos State by TOS funeral and the autopsy conducted at the expense of the Lagos State Government.\n\nThe second autopsy was carried out at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital on December 14,2021, in the presence of representatives of all the parties involved in the case.\n\nThe autopsy was carried out by Dr. S.S Soyemi, the Consultant Pathologist and Chief Examiner , Department of Pathology and Forensic Sciences, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital Ikeja.\n\nThe autopsy was witnessed by the following persons: Dr. Uwon Eze, Consultant Pathologist , from UCH, who represented Timiles family; Dr. Badmus Kabiru, Consultant Pathologist from LUTH ,represented Dowen College; Dr. Nigwe Chikodili Isabila, Consultant Pathologist from Military Hospital , Yaba, represented Edward Brown, a student of Dowen College; Dr Clement Vhriterhire, Consultant Pathologist who performed the first autopsy, represented family of the deceased; Dr. Musa Stephen Itopa, Consultant Pathologist, from UBTH, represented Kashamu Michael, a student of Dowen College; Dr. F. E Emiogun, Consultant Pathologist in LASUTH; Dr. O.O Kilauvie- Emegbo, Consultant Pathologist, LASUTh; Dr O.O Onayemi, Senior Registra in LASUTH; Dr N. Salisu, Senior Registra in autopsy posting in LASUTECH, Dr. AC China, Registra from ABU, from autopsy posting in LASUTH; Dr. F. Emetomah,Registra, CSP Rasaq Oseni, from the Homicide section, represented the Nigeria Police Force , Lagos State Command; DSP Olusegun Bamidele, also from the Homicide section, represented the Nigeria Police Force , LAGOS state command, Sergeant Shola Adeniyi, Homicide section also represented the Lagos State Police Command.\n\n\u201cBefore the expiration of 21 days remand order, families of the students applied for their bail at Magistrate Court 1, Yaba. The application was approved, hence the students who were earlier remanded at Boys Home, Oregun, were granted bail.\n\nThe House Masters were also granted bail after the expiration of the 21 days remand order.\n\n\u201c The result of the second autopsy carried out in Lagos which was released on December 21,2021, attributed the cause of death to septicemia , lobar pneumonia with acute pyelonephritis and phyomyositis of the right angle.\n\nOn December 30,2021, the Toxicology screening result of the first autopsy carried in Warri was released. The result issued and signed by Dr. Clement Vhriterhire, same Doctor who carried out the initial autopsy, attributed cause of death to acute bacteria , pneumonia due to severe sepsis.\n\nAt the end of diligent investigation carried out so far, there is no evidence to establish a case of torture , bullying and forceful application of poisonous substance against the suspects. All the suspects denied the allegations of torture, bullying and administering of poisonous substance to the deceased. Allegation that the deceased was being forced to join a cult group was also not established , as other students interviewed denied this.\n\nThe final result of the post-mortem and Toxicology examination conducted both at Warri and Lagos, agreed that the deceased died a natural death.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the transparent investigation carried out by the Police and the non establishment of prima facie case against the suspects, some members of the Ijaw Youths Council, Lagos, led by Comrade Henry Oyobolo, protested in front of DOWEN college for over two hours on January 6,2022.\n\nThe protesters, including masquerades carried placards and were drumming, thereby causing panic and apprehension. As much as we commiserate with the bereaved family on the death of their lovely and promising child, it is advised that the protesters and other individuals or groups, who are still aggrieved, should go to the law court to seek redress, instead of taking laws into their own hands.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public who may have any misgivings about the outcome of Police investigation, medical enquiry and legal advice with this case , are advised to follow due process in law , rather than resorting to self help. The Police will not fold their hands and allow any act of omission that could threaten the peace being enjoined in the state.",

          "text": "It has been confirmed that gold mining is responsible for the colour change of the Osun River.\n\nThe colour changes as confirmed by experts is the result of the use of heavy metals like lead and mercury in the processing of gold.\n\nStating this on Friday in Osogbo on a radio current affairs programme, Anthony Adejuwon, Team Lead of Urban Alert, a Non-Governmental Organisation said the case of pollution of the Osun River is serious because the gold miners use the river to wash sediments from their digs.\n\nAdejuwon revealed that since the river passes through 20 communities along its course, inhabitants of the communities stand the risk of the dangers posed by the pollutants.\n\nThe Urban Alert team lead claimed the state government only took action on the peoples complaints after the State Assembly oversight committee confirmed that the river was already polluted.\n\nHe explained that scientists from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife undertook a microbial and physicochemical test on the river and arrived at the shocking results.\n\nHe informed that the scientists found that mining sites in Osun, Esa-Odo town and some towns in Obokun local government were affected while the body of water in Kajola dam has been changed to brown.\n\nIn his words, \u201cOsun River is part of Osun Osogbo sacred grove which is a point of attraction for local and international tourists.\n\n\u201cIt flows from Osogbo, to Ede, Asejire and then into Oyo State. Due to its flow into Asejire dam, the waterworks situated on the river has been forced to spend more in its purification method.\u201d\n\nWhile maintaining that the Osun devotees have made all overtures to get the government to intervene, Adejuwon held that the development has not gotten the desired attention.\n\nHe also added that despite Osun devotees belief that the river is still potent, they were now beginning to show signs of worry about the health of the river.\n\nWhile condemning the on-the-spot assessment of government as ineffective, he maintained that the state government has the power to act through the land use act rather than giving excuses that mining is on the exclusive list.\n\nCalling on the people to speak up to prevent unnecessary deaths, he disclosed that everybody is at risk because the impact is dormant adding that the possibility of serious health issues cropping up in the future is feasible.\n\nThe Urban Alert Team Lead called on the federal government to step into the situation and proffer solutions.\n\nHe advocated joint efforts to stop the pollutants which have been scientifically proven to be 8,000 to 21,000 percent above the permissible levels.\n\n\u201cWe have sent electronic mails to the state governor, the three senators in the state because the river flows into Osun from the East, through the Central and flows out through the West.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, mercury and lead have adverse effects on women and children.\n\nThe Osun Rivers has its source in Igede-Ekiti through Osun, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos and then into the lagoon.",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation; Bolaji Ogundele; Eric Ikhilae\n\nPGF DG writes Buhari, says convention must hold or Caretaker Committee resigns\n\nHow APC govs begged President to intervene; to meet on Wednesday\n\nAggrieved members ask court to halt February convention\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) leaders are rallying to keep the party on track for its crucial national convention following Thursday\u2019s warning by President Muhammadu Buhari that the party should keep its house in order ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\n\nGovernors elected on the platform of the APC yesterday met with Buhari, 24 hours after his warning as part of the efforts to resolve the logjam holding up the convention.\n\nA follow-up meeting of the governors has been scheduled for Wednesday to pick a definite date for the convention.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe meeting was originally planned for tomorrow.\n\nBuhari personally asked for the convention timetable from the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, The Nation gathered yesterday.\n\nThis came as some members of the party approached the Federal High Court in Abuja to restrain the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) from holding the national convention next month.\n\nSimultaneously, the Director-General, Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman, wrote a memo to the APC hierarchy, asking the CECPC to proceed with the convention plan or resign.\n\nIt was learnt that some governors, including an influential one, had reached out to the President in the last one and a half weeks to intervene in the hiccups delaying the convention.\n\nAccording to investigation, Buhari had received representations from some governors and party leaders on the danger of not holding APC National Convention on time.\n\nIt was learnt that the President was no longer comfortable with the delay of the convention.\n\nA top source said yesterday: \u201cThe dilly-dallying over APC National Convention may soon end because President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the Caretaker Committee to come up with a timetable for the convention.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s directive might have been informed by representations from some governors and stakeholders to him in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe representations and looming stress in the party made the President to warn APC leaders and members on Thursday of the consequences of disunity in the party.\n\n\u201cIf the Caretaker Committee can draw a timeline, there will be less tension in the party. Let us hope something will be done.\u201d\n\nBut a Presidency source said: \u201cI have not been told that (the directive)\u201d, while a state governor said he was aware that the President \u201chas taken action and given advisory to the Caretaker Committee to act on a timeline for the convention.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cWe have got a notice of a meeting of APC governors on Sunday in Abuja. We will discuss the advisory of the President and agree on a date for the convention.\n\nA governor said: \u201cWe have reached a critical point to save the party and the CECPC from rebellion. Some of us are becoming impatient with the conduct of the Caretaker Committee, but we do not want a full blown crisis in APC.\n\n\u201cA few of us have gone to the President to give him the other side of the way the party is being managed and the danger ahead.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the Chairman of CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni, is a good man who cannot hurt a fly. But some of our leaders are taking advantage of his broad-mindedness to misdirect the Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cEven some governors who did not know how APC was formed are neck-deep in trying to hijack the activities of the Caretaker Committee.\u201d\n\nLalong: APC governors to decide convention date\n\nGovernors Simon Lalong of Plateau State yesterday confirmed a planned meeting of the APC governors to decide on a definite date for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nEmerging from a meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Lalong said the President\u2019s Thursday warning to the party was a signal for the APC to have a seamless convention to avert disintegration.\n\nThe warning, according to him, was for the APC to redouble its effort and do the right thing.\n\nHis words: \u201cYou know, when convention is coming, there are fears here and there. Some people will tell you it will work, it will not work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to jump to conclusion, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday.\n\n\u201cBy Sunday, we will tell you when we\u2019re doing the convention.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt last night that the meeting was rescheduled for Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think (during) our first date before Christmas, we said we were going to do convention in February and we are still working for convention as far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle.\n\n\u201cBut as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThese are the things that the President was raising fears about. But we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election.\n\n\u201cSome parties have done their own. The PDP did their own; nothing will stop APC from doing their own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, is all about telling the governors \u2018please do more, keep the party alive\u2019. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to keep our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss. But I\u2019m not drawing any conclusion. I always tell you that a political party is a cumulation of interests. The interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\u201d\n\nLalong said tomorrow\u2019s meeting would address all the contending issues affecting the conduct of the convention.\n\n\u201cWhen we meet, we\u2019ll harmonise all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss, I have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party, because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from the present government.\u201d\n\nAsked if the many court cases pending against the party and its leadership would not scuttle the planned convention, he said: \u201cThere are procedures to holding court processes.\n\n\u201cMany of the court processes were there when we set up the caretaker committee, but up to this moment, if you go to take a census of some of the court proceedings, you will realise that a lot of them have been resolved out of court.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s still the duty of the party; it\u2019s still part of the functions of the party to resolve.\n\n\u201cBut we must not wait to resolve all court processes before we go for convention. I don\u2019t think so, because there are also machineries for resolving court process, even after convention.\n\n\u201cI had a court process in my state; that did not stop me from going on, and at the end of the day, we resolved the court process and we\u2019re still going on, preparing and waiting for convention.\u201d\n\nOn whether the APC could meet the speculated date of February 5 for the convention in view of the need for a mandatory 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Lalong said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the chairman of the convention committee, but I want to assure you that we\u2019ve called a meeting for Sunday, and if there is a meeting on Sunday, and you\u2019re thinking about next Friday, just wait and see what will happen before next Friday. I don\u2019t want to draw conclusion now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already talking of litigations, you draw conclusions, somebody will go and file a case tomorrow. So, I don\u2019t want us to draw a conclusion on that. But I want to assure you that we are meeting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re meeting and we\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019re going to keep and then with the admonition given by the President, it\u2019s a warning signal to all of us to sit up and ensure that we have a seamless, very clean, fair and transparent convention so that our party will not get disintegrated,\u201d he said.\n\nAggrieved APC members ask court to stop convention\n\nSome aggrieved members of the party are asking the Federal High Court in Abuja to restrain the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker-and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) from holding the party\u2019s national convention next month.\n\nThe members are Suleiman Usman (from Nyanya ward, Federal Capital Territory -FCT), Muhammed Shehu (Banga ward, Kaura Namoda Local Government Area, Zamfara) and Audu Emmanuel (Furfuri ward, Bungudu LGA, Zamfara State).\n\nThe plaintiffs in suit FHC/ABJ/CS/3/2022, filed by their lawyer, Olusola Ojo, claim that the APC would be violating its constitution if allowed to proceed to hold the convention in February.\n\nAccording to them, having not conducted congresses in all the 36 states and the FCT, the APC could not legitimately hold a national convention.\n\nDefendants in the suit are the APC, the Chairman of the CECPC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe plaintiffs, in a supporting affidavit, said the APC held its state congresses on October 16, 2021 in 34 states, with the exclusion of Anambra and Zamfara states.\n\nThe plaintiffs raised five questions for the Court to determine and also sought eight declarative reliefs.\n\nThey asked for an order of the court \u201crestraining the 1st and 2nd defendants from organising and conducting the national convention of the 1st defendant unless state congresses of the 1st defendant were first concluded in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThey sought for an order directing the APC and the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee to first conduct state congresses of the 1st defendant in Anambra and Zamfara states before the national convention of the 1st defendant can be scheduled and conducted.\n\nThey urged the court to restrain INEC from giving effect to any action of the APC and the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee to organise and conduct national convention unless state congresses are conducted or concluded in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nPGF DG: Caretaker committee must hold convention or give way\n\nIn a memo to governors elected on the platform of the APC, the Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman, drew their attention to the danger of further delay in holding the convention.\n\nLukman, in the January 3, 2022 letter entitled \u2018Plausibility of February 2022 APC Convention\u2019 said the governors and others in the party risked being damaged politically if the needful was not done immediately.\n\n\u201cOnce things go wrong with the party, the governors and especially the leadership of the Forum will be damaged politically,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the fact that we would have all succeeded, both leaders and members, to have contributed to damaging the political credentials of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cAPC leaders should imagine the consequences of ruining the electoral potentials in 2023 such that beyond losing the Federal Government, self-implicated legal challenges are created to weaken the party simply because of actions or inactions of HE Buni and Secretary, John James Akpan Udoedehe.\n\n\u201cAlready, some media reports are suggesting that the work of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu\u2019s Reconciliation Committee will determine whether the convention should hold in February or not.\n\n\u201cSenator Adamu himself has argued that they will conclude their work and reconcile those that can be reconciled by the end of January 2022. It needs to be stated that so long as the party exists, there will always be leadership disputes.\u201d\n\nBuhari, in his Thursday television interview, had urged APC leaders to put their house in order to enable the party retain power in 2023.\n\nHe warned against the persistent differences, disunity and lack of agreement, which he said could put the platform in jeopardy during election.\n\n\u201cWe have a timeframe we have to work because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered with by anybody. So, if the APC can\u2019t agree, then the opposition will naturally take over,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cWhat did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together. But when ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realised it, they were off. They are still off. They can see it.\n\n\u201cMy position is simple. I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then, to Abuja.\n\n\u201cSo, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituencies, they will know their leaders, coming up. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\u201d",
          "summary": "Buhari personally asked for the convention timetable from the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, The Nation gathered yesterday.\nAccording to investigation, Buhari had received representations from some governors and party leaders on the danger of not holding APC National Convention on time.\nA top source said yesterday: \u201cThe dilly-dallying over APC National Convention may soon end because President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the Caretaker Committee to come up with a timetable for the convention.\n\u201cIf the Caretaker Committee can draw a timeline, there will be less tension in the party.\nSome of us are becoming impatient with the conduct of the Caretaker Committee, but we do not want a full blown crisis in APC.",

          "text": "President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor, has said restructuring is not a threat to the unity of Nigeria. Prof. Obiozor who spoke on Friday on Arise TV morning show, said that restructuring is a national blessing. \u201cRestructuring is not a threat to the national unity, it is a very dynamic thing in a dynamic institution of a nation state where as you grow, new things are developed and new ideology evolves. In fact every country that is wise and progressive takes restructuring into account as they grow. In case of Nigeria it will help to build a more perfect federation or union where conflict will be less and cooperation will be more.\u201d\n\nHe said if Nigerians had taken to 2014 National Conference, most problems faced by the country today would have been solved. \u201cIf we had taken time to look at restructuring, we should have actually taken more from the 2014 National Conference to lessen the conflicts that exist in this country, whether it is in our fiscal federalism, political or boundary issues particularly in revenue sharing. It is absolutely a problem federations solve very easily. Unfortunately all matters in Nigeria are over politicised.\u201d\n\nOn Nnamdi Kanu, he said that though President Muhammadu Buhari was right when he said that the case was in court, he however urged the president to apply his prerogative of mercy on the case. \u201cThe president said that the matter is in the court and you cannot fault that one. If he says he does not want to interfere in the function of the judiciary, there is division of labour at Federal level where judiciary is independent, so, he is technically right in thinking that the case is already on. We are asking for something different from the judiciary and we are asking for him to consider his prerogative of mercy which is his own prerogative.\n\n\u201cThe idea is treating him with mercy as a son and citizen, to be considerate and compassionate. We are not talking about the judiciary. If he is taking the judiciary route then he is taking the right route logically, but then away from what we are talking. We are appealing for mercy and some form of amnesty.\u201d He said that IPOB does not speak for Ndigbo and equally chided the Northerners who encourage their youths to make comments that incite.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cTake it from me and it is the right statement, IPOB doesn\u2019t speak for Igbo and that is the truth and to be very candid with you, the IPOB anger is an accumulated anger based on perceived or real injustice against Ndigbo for so long. We understand their anger and anger of many youths across the country, however the truth of the matter is that they are not mandated to speak for Ndigbo and the Northern groups that are making the statements is unfortunate because we don\u2019t respond when their youths in their youthful exuberant make certain comments like they did before that all Igbo must leave the North In fact the idea that some responsible people in the North can take position, it is predetermined.\n\nOn state police, Ebebuagu, he said the state police or formation of Ebubeagu or Amotekun is imperative in a federation like Nigeria. \u201cIf you want to be effective country, you have to look at how other countries succeeded not how they failed. The reality in Nigeria today is that Nigeria police is so small to police our country. You need not call it a state police. You can call it state guard or anything but train them to detect crime and reduce crime. As society gets sophiscated, crime will increase and nobody will say Nigeria is not developing no matter how slow you can see it.\u201d\n\nOn presidency, he said a President from Igboland and South East is an idea whose time has come. \u201cIt is politically justifiable and morally defenciable, it is indeed logical and in all sincerity, justice, equity and fairness have finally come home to Nigeria to crowd the Nigerian political history,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations will finally take place this month, following a seven-month delay. 24 teams from Africa will battle it out to be the AFCON champion. This is a selection of 12 players who we think will make an impact at the tournament \u2013 some are obvious, some less so.\n\nCote D\u2019Ivoire reached the quarter-finals at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, led by Manchester United player Eric Bailly in the heart of defence. Bailly will be directing affairs from the back once more in Cameroon, ably aided by former Spurs, Paris Saint-Germain and current Villarreal defender Serge Aurier. \u2018The Elephants\u2019 will also be boosted by the arrival of twin-threat Wilfred Zaha and Arsenal\u2019s Nicolas Pepe up front. Egypt made it to the last eight in Tokyo and they were knocked out by eventual champion Brazil. Their star man Mo Salah was named in the Olympic squad but eventually dropped due to his club Liverpool\u2019s decision not to allow him to travel to Japan.\n\n\u2018The Pharoahs\u2019 will have a huge boost with Salah ready to star in Cameroon: Egyptian fans will be hoping that the current Premier league top scorer can help fire them to a record eight African title.\n\nCoach Carlos Queiroz has bolstered the Egyptian squad with the call-up of Salah, Arsenal\u2019s Mohamed Elneny, Al Ahly keeper Mohamed El-Shennawy, and Aston Villa winger Mahmoud \u2018Trezeguet\u2019 Hassan.\n\nSenegal are stacked with star names too like Salah\u2019s Liverpool strike partner Sadio Mane, world-class centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly, who plays in Italy for Napoli, and the Premier League duo of Edouard Mendy and Chiekhou Kouyate joining PSG\u2019s Idrissa Gana Gueye. Then there\u2019s Algeria who have an attacking line-up that\u2019ll give defenders waking nightmares, led by Mahrez and West Ham winger Benrahma with Adam Ounas (Napoli, Italy) and Islam Slimani (Lyon, France) ones to watch too.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAt the back the experienced Issa Mandy, who plays in Spain\u2019s La Liga with Villarreal, is rocklike. Then there\u2019s Morocco\u2019s Sevilla trio of goalkeeper Yassine Bono, and attacking double threat Munir El Haddadi, and Youssef En-Nesyri.\n\nBut they won\u2019t have Barcelona\u2019s exciting 20-year-old wide man Ez Abde as Xavi has convinced him that Barca need him and he has an important role to play over the next few weeks. And we still haven\u2019t talked about a certain Pierre Emerick Aubameyang who\u2019ll lead the Gabon line.\n\nYou could go on.Like Nigeria\u2019s Leicester City\u2019s holding midfielder Wilfred Ndidi and his Foxes teammate Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nMOHAMED SALAH (EGYPT)\n\nProbably the best performing player in world football across 2021-22 will be at AFCON 2021, with Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah hoping to lead Egypt to their first Africa Cup of Nations title since 2010.\n\nSalah has been in frighteningly good form in the domestic season so far, continuing his excellent career at Liverpool since joining the club in 2017-18. In all five seasons he\u2019s been at the Premier League side, Salah has scored at least 20 goals, with his goal in his last appearance against Chelsea his 23rd of 2021-22. With 16 goals and nine assists, the Liverpool star has 25 goal involvements in the Premier League already in 2021-22, having played just 20 games. He\u2019s averaged a goal involvement every 71 minutes in the Premier League this season, which is his best rate in any top-flight league campaign across his career.\n\nAcross all competitions, Salah has 23 goals in 26 appearances this season for Liverpool. The record for a player across all competitions for Premier League clubs is 44 goals which is currently held by Salah himself from 2017-18, level with Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2002-03 for Manchester United.\n\nA major part of Salah\u2019s game is his ability to run at opposition defences in the build up to a goal. In the Premier League this season, he\u2019s scored five goals and assisted four more following a ball carry of at least five metres \u2013 those nine goal involvements are four more than any other player.\n\nSalah comes into this Africa Cup of Nations tournament with 10 previous appearances and four goals across his two tournaments in 2017 and 2019, with Egypt hoping his goals can fire them to glory this time around after a disappointing exit in the Last 16 to South Africa in the last edition.\n\nKAMALDEEN SULEMANA (GHANA)\n\nThe transfer of Kamaldeen Sulemana from FC Nordsj\u00e6lland to Rennes wasn\u2019t headline news outside of Denmark, but the move for a reported \u20ac20 million came with some pressure attached. That fee was record tally received by a Danish club, but it\u2019s proven money well spent for the Ligue 1 side so far in 2021-22.\n\nStill only 19 years old and the third youngest name in Ghana\u2019s squad for this tournament, Sulemana has enjoyed his time at Rennes across the first five months \u2013 he\u2019s scored four goals and assisted two more in just 996 minutes of Ligue 1 action.\n\nWhat attracted Rennes to the young Ghanian star? In last season\u2019s Danish Superliga, he attempted 246 take-ons \u2013 almost double the number of LoukaPrip, who attempted the second most (126). If that sounds like a lot, it\u2019s because it is. Only Lionel Messi attempted more (261) in the entire top five European Leagues last season.\n\nKamaldeen harnessed his pace and dribbling skills to also lead the Danish Superliga for take-ons in opposition half (199), nearly double that of Jesper Lindstrom in second (104) also led the league for take-ons in the opposition box (34).\n\nSulemana made his full senior debut for Ghana in October 2020 in their match against Mali. At the time of writing, he is yet to score in six appearances for the Black Stars, but there\u2019s every chance he could break his duck in this tournament.\n\nRead Also: AFCON: Musa, Chukwueze strikes sink Coton Sport in practice match\n\nEDMOND TAPSOBA (BURKINA FASO)\n\nStill only 22 years old, Edmond Tapsoba\u2019s qualities have been obvious since he joined Bayer Leverkusen in January 2020 from Portuguese club Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es.\n\nThe Burkina Faso central defender is dependable \u2013 only making one error leading to an opposition goal in his 54 Bundesliga appearances \u2013 but also comfortable with the ball at his feet.\n\nAcross his Bundesliga career, he\u2019s rarely given possession away, averaging a 90% pass accuracy, but should passing options be unavailable, Tapsoba is also one of the most adept defenders at carrying the ball out of defence and progressing the ball up field.\n\nSince 2020-21, only one player has averaged more ball carries per 90 minutes than the Burkinab\u00e9 defender (24.3), while Bayern\u2019s Alphonso Davies is the only player to average more progressive ball carries per 90 than the Burkina Faso international (13.5). At 6-foot-4, he is an imposing figure in both boxes and will be a threat at set-pieces for Burkina Faso at this tournament, as shown with his recent Bundesliga goal against Greuther F\u00fcrth in December.\n\nDespite having host nation Cameroon in their group, Burkina Faso should expect to qualify for the knockout stages at AFCON 2021. Having an in-form Edmond Tapsoba in the heart of their defence will be crucial to securing that.\n\nANDR\u00c9 ONANA (CAMEROON)\n\nAndr\u00e9 Onana comes into AFCON 2021 with little football under his belt. The Cameroon goalkeeper will likely be the first choice in goal for the host nation in the tournament, despite playing just two competitive matches for Ajax in 2021-22 after a global ban following a failed drugs test.\n\nNow backup at Ajax, Onana has agreed a deal at Serie A side Internazionale when his contract runs out in the Netherlands this summer and there\u2019s little doubt at the quality that the reigning Italian champions will be getting with his signature.\n\nBefore his suspension, Onana was one of the best performing goalkeepers in the Dutch Eredivisie. According to Opta\u2019s Expected Goals on Target data, across 2019-20 and 2020-21 the Ajax shot-stopper prevented 10 goals with his saves.\n\nIn 2018-19 he was a key part of the young Ajax side that progressed to the UEFA Champions League semi-finals, where he became the first ever African goalkeeper to play in a semi-final in the competition since its inception in 1992 \u2013 a record that was surpassed by \u00c9douard Mendy in 2020-21 when his Chelsea side reached the final before defeating Manchester City.\n\nOnana will be playing in his second Africa Cup of Nations tournament this time around, following 2019. In that tournament, Onana and Cameroon kept a clean sheet in all three group stage matches but were eventually undone by Nigeria (3-2) in the Last 16. They\u2019ll be hoping that they can go further as host nation on this occasion, and their goalkeeper will be key to any chance they have.\n\nMOHAMED BAYO (GUINEA)\n\nMohamed Bayo comes into AFCON 2021 as Guinea\u2019s major goal threat following a brilliant 18 months at club level. His nation are expected to qualify for the Last 16 from Group B, but they\u2019ll need Bayo to continue his club form to do so.\n\nOnly two players have scored more goals in Ligue 1 this season than the Clermont man (9). His nine goals mean he\u2019s scored 45% of his side\u2019s league total so far in 2021-22.\n\nThis follows an exceptional 2020-21 domestic season, in which Bayo topped the Ligue 2 scoring charts with 22 goals to fire Clermont Foot to the French top-flight. Last season he averaged a goal every 140 minutes in the second tier within France, and so far, the step up to Ligue 1 hasn\u2019t phased him at all, with Bayo currently averaging a goal every 149 minutes in 2021-22.\n\nDespite previously being a winger earlier in his career, Bayo has adapted to the needs of a striker within the box. His eight non-penalty goals in Ligue 1 this season have an average distance of 7.4 yards, which is like last season where he scored all 22 of his goals from inside the box. In fact, no player has scored more goals inside the six-yard box than Bayo in Ligue 1 this season (four).\n\nOnly one of Guinea\u2019s last six Africa Cup of Nations participations have seen them fail to make it out of the group stage (2012), so there\u2019s a good chance they can progress to the Round of 16 and beyond in this tournament, so Bayo could have a great outside chance of finishing as top scorer.\n\nILIAS CHAIR (MOROCCO)\n\nIn 2021, Ilias Chair cemented his place in the Morocco squad, winning seven caps and even netting his first goal for his country versus Guinea-Bissau in October. Chair, who cuts a diminutive figure, is a player whose stock has been on the rise in England in recent years. AFCON 2021 might prove to be the stage in which Chair establishes himself as a starter",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation\n\nAccuse him of plotting to stop reappointment of DG for second term\n\nDauda: Allegations against me spurious, baseless\n\nSecurity agencies are probing a former Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ambassador Mohammed Dauda, for allegedly leaking secret files of the agency to the media and groups.\n\nThe ex-intelligence chief is also under investigation in connection with some petitions allegedly undermining the NIA and alleged attempt to implicate some of its directors.\n\nSome of the leaks, according to claims, were aimed at stopping the reappointment of the present NIA DG, Amb. Ahmed Rufai Abubakar.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThere were indications yesterday that the agencies might seek the extradition of the ex-NIA boss because some of the leaks allegedly traced to him fell into the hands of foreign intelligence agencies.\n\nDauda, who served as DG of NIA for a month between 2017 and 2018, has relocated to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) on self-exile pending the resolution of his case in court.\n\nHe got a judgment in 2020 from the National Industrial Court (NIC) directing the Presidency to reinstate him.\n\nAlthough the Federal Government has filed an appeal against the judgment, security agencies are said to be uncomfortable with Dauda\u2019s alleged covert activities in Dubai.\n\nBut Dauda, who spoke with our correspondent, dismissed the allegations against him as baseless and frivolous.\n\nSecurity agencies claim that Dauda is still in possession of some \u201cclassified information\u201d which he has allegedly been releasing to \u201churt\u201d Nigeria\u2019s security system.\n\nIt was learnt that in 2018, a Special Management Staff Disciplinary Committee alleged that Dauda was culpable of the same offences under investigation.\n\nThese include \u201cbreach of confidentiality, violation of oath of secrecy/allegiance, misapplication of agency funds, unlawful petition, disobedience of lawful orders, falsehood and prevarication, injurious rumour peddling and violation of Section 108 on unauthorised publication in the media.\u201d\n\nA top source, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cSecurity agencies are investigating ex-NIA boss for alleged acts capable of undermining the nation\u2019s intelligence.\n\n\u201cApart from leaking some official secrets to cause disaffection in NIA, Dauda has been on the radar for spreading falsehood and propaganda against this agency with a low profile mandate.\n\n\u201cSince 2018, NIA has been under attacks from its former helmsman. He appeared in February 2018 before the House of Representatives where he divulged classified security issues which later gained traction in the media.\n\n\u201cInternational security agencies were afraid to collaborate with their Nigerian counterparts because of such leaks. And the ex-NIA boss has not relented from his exile base in Dubai.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question, the source added: \u201cFrom the look of things, Nigeria will have no choice but to seek the extradition of Dauda from Dubai.\n\n\u201cIt is against diplomatic norm for a former intelligence chief to use the UAE to launch attacks on his former office.\n\n\u201cThis ex-NIA DG has breached diplomatic and intelligence protocols. Such unethical attitude is unacceptable anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cIn and out of office, a secret service official is expected to be anonymous for life. Otherwise, these infractions attract sanctions.\n\nIt was learnt that Dauda was suspected of intensifying his game as part of the plot to stop the reappointment of the NIA DG, Ambassador Ahmed Rufai Abubakar, for a second term.\n\nAn intelligence officer said: \u201cYou know Ambassador Ahmed Rufai Abubakar came on board in January 2018 and his tenure is due for renewal for second term.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that the ongoing rubbish from Dauda and others was part of moves to stop President Muhammadu Buhari from giving a second term to the NIA DG.\n\n\u201cThis is why they attempted to sell a dummy to the public that NIA Directors petitioned the President. This is false; there was no letter sent to the President by the directors.\n\n\u201cThey have failed in their bid to cause internal disaffection in NIA.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Dauda described the allegations against him as baseless and sheer falsehood.\n\nHe said: \u201cLeaking information? It is a complete lie; I have nothing to do with it. They used to come up with spurious allegations anytime they come under pressure. When they have nothing to say, they will start blaming me. I am always the scapegoat.\n\n\u201cI have been outside the country for four years, where will I get information to leak? Where will I get documents against my country or NIA?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to do with undermining the security of Nigeria or subversive activities. How can I or why should I undermine Nigeria\u2019s security? If they have evidence against me, let them show it.\n\n\u201cWhen I took NIA to court over my sack, it took them years of foot-dragging at the High Court but I won the case. The court ordered that I should be reinstated as the DG of NIA.\n\n\u201cNow, they have gone to the Court of Appeal and instead of making their case, they are dragging their feet at the appellate court again.\n\n\u201cAll these attacks were because of the victory I secured at the High Court. They know I did my best and I had a good record in office and my sack was unjustified.\u201d\n\nIn case NICN/ABJ/136/2018, Dauda had faulted his dismissal and asked the National Industrial Court to determine whether the procedure adopted was in compliance with Article 8(1) and (2) of the National Securities Agency Act (CAPS 278) 1986.\n\nThe ex-NIA boss, through his lawyer, Kanu Agabi (SAN), also asked the court to declare the purported letter of his dismissal of March 6, 2018, unlawful, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\n\nHe urged the court to reinstate him as director and order for the payment of his salaries and other entitlements from the date of his unlawful dismissal to the date of his reinstatement.\n\nThe Presiding judge, Justice Olufunke Anuwe granted all the reliefs sought by the claimant. The judge declared Dauda\u2019s dismissal illegal, null and void, and ordered his immediate reinstatement.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday took disturbing dimensions when the Director-General of the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, demanded immediate resignation of the Chairman and Secretary of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni and Sen John James Akpanudoedehe, respectively.\n\nThe PGF DG hinged his demand for their resignation on their failure to put practical arrangements in place for the initially agreed February 5, 2022 APC National Convention.\n\nIn the letter dated January 5, 2022 he wrote to PGF Chairman, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, Lukman also urged Governor Buni to clear himself from the speculations that he wants to transmute to the substantive National Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cAs things are, if the APC National Convention is to hold February 5, 2022 as decided, by January 15, 2022, notice of the Convention must be transmitted to Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as required by the Electoral Act. In which case, details of the agenda of the Convention and Venue should have been decided. If this is not the case, it should be taken that the CECPC chairman, Mala Buni and Secretary, Akpanudoedehe have decided not to implement the decision to hold the Convention on February 5, 2022.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere in APC Constitution or any law for that matter, that confer prerogative of whether an important decision such as holding the National Convention should hold or not on the party Chairman and Secretary. At best, if there are challenges, they should present the challenges to superior organs of the party.\n\n\u201cIt may be necessary for party leaders to therefore consider convening emergency meeting of the National Caucus to review all these developments and perhaps give opportunity to the Chairman, Mala Buni and Secretary, Akpanudoedehe to explain whatever difficulty they may be having.\n\n\u201cIt may also be necessary to appeal to both Mala Buni and Akpanudoedehe, in the event that superior organ of the party, possibly the National Caucus, is unable to meet before January 15, 2022, they should take the path of honour and honourably resigned if by that date they have not conclude preparations for the Convention and appropriate notice to INEC duly served as required by the law.\n\n\u201cShould that be the case, Your Excellency, may again have to provide the leadership to facilitate consultations with President Buhari and all party leaders to choose necessary replacements from among members of the CECPC or in whatever way possible. Your Excellency, at this point, given experiences first with the Comrade Oshiomhole-led NWC and now with the His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC, there is the glaring issue of political leadership recruitment challenges, which if not resolved will continue to undermine the capacity to produce competent political leaders in the country,\u201d he warned.\n\nAlso reflected in the letter he wrote to the PGF Chairman, included his warning that the duo are taking the Governors Forum for granted.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cAs the Chairman of Forum, you had to take very difficult internal initiatives to unite Governors and party leaders.\n\n\u201cYou were able to earn the confidence of President Buhari and party leaders based on your leadership ability to ensure that all Governors are united to support the work of the CECPC. Your Excellency, it would appear that both the CECPC Chairman, Mala Buni and Secretary, Akpanudoedehe are taking the support of the Forum for granted to the point of working to sabotage the decisions of holding the APC National Convention on February 5, 2022 based on the recommendations of Forum.\n\n\u201cThis is a very dangerous trend. Some of the speculations as the reasons for that include the alleged ambition of Mala Buni to manipulate his emergence as the substantive National Chairman of the party. Ideally, there should be nothing wrong with this once he is able to satisfy the requirements of the law and the party\u2019s Constitution. If true, however, the assumption that he will provide neutral leadership, which is required to guarantee level playing field that was the basis of vesting him with the responsibility of serving as the Chairman of CECPC has been eroded.\n\n\u201cShould it be confirmed that Mala Buni is aspiring to be the substantive National Chairman of APC, in whatever way possible, elementary logic required that he should be immediately replaced as Chairman of CECPC. This is further strengthened by the fact that being a serving Governor, he is disqualified to aspire to hold any position, which the law only permits him to hold on temporary basis,\u201d he warned.\n\nLukman also copied party leaders like President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President. Sen Ahmed Lawan Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, Progressive Governors, Chief Bisi Akande, former APC Interim National Chairman Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, former APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, former APC National Chairman, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, APC National Leader, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, former National Chairman of ANPP and members of the CECPC.",

          "text": "Northern elders: Buhari\u2019s comments on restructuring, state police insensitive\n\n\u2022 There should always be room for political solutions\n\nFrom Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari dos not have the final say on the contentious issues of restructuring, state police, and the release of detained agitators for self-determination.\n\nReacting to President Buhari\u2019s statement in an exclusive television interview on Wednesday, spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Hakeem Baba-Ahmad said the voice of majority of Nigerians advocating restructuring must be respected.\n\nAhmad also said that Buhari\u2019s fear that state police might be abused by state governors did not hold water, adding that there is federal might to checkmate such abuses.\n\nOn the release of agitators, NEF Spokesman cautioned Buhari to allow judicial process has its way, rather than heating the already tensed situation.\n\n\u201cThe worry now is the huge distance which appears to exist between the thinking and posit of the President and those of other Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThere is virtually unanimity on the need to restructure the country, even if the details may vary. To shut out a major issue like restructuring that could determine the future of the country is insensitive at best and contemptuous at worst.\n\n\u201cOn state police, if the President\u2019s objection is predicated on abuses by governors over local government assets, we have to ask what he has done to stop such abuses with his huge powers. In any case the country should work towards producing better quality of leadership at all levels so that our federal system is not held hostage to incompetence and corruption of elected leaders.\n\n\u201cOn the release of agitators, we have made our position very clear. The judicial process should be allowed to determine whether they are guilty of threatening our existence as a country or not, as well as their involvement in criminal activities.\n\n\u201cThere should always be room for political solutions, but they must not cause more damage that already exists,\u201d Baba-Ahmad said.\n\nAPC has jettisoned its campaign promises \u2013PANDEF, MBF, SOKAPU\n\nBy Vincent Kalu\n\nThe midweek television interview in which President Muhammadu Buhari spoke extensively on some contentious national issues, while fielding questions from his interviewers, have continued to attract reactions from across the country.\n\nNational President of PANDEF, Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, wondered why the president and his ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), would jettison what was a campaign promise on which they rode into power.\n\n\u201cIf after six years, going to seven, he came out to bluntly tell Nigerians that there is nothing like restructuring, it means they have to look for a saviour that would restructure Nigeria in some other party. Nobody can say, \u2018no\u2019 to restructuring because Nigeria can never have peace until it is restructured.\u201d\n\nNational President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, agreed with Essien when he mentioned the case of Katsina State taken out of then Kaduna State, which in terms of population is about one third of the state. Yet it was given 34 local governments areas while Kaduna has less than 30, he pointed out. \u201cThis thing happened all over the North and today, we base everything on local governments, whether it is primary elections, revenue allocations, etc. We are all watching; everything he does is being watched and assessed. In the South-West, why would Osun have about 30 or more local government areas? What is its population? There are some local governments that were made federal constituencies just to favour a section of this country.\u201d\n\nHe warned: \u201cThat is what created all these distortions, which has made Nigeria what it is. If we don\u2019t correct these things so that people will no more continue to use them to destabilise this country and to override the rest, we would continue to have problems.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nEssien who expressed his disappointment with the President\u2019s decision to veto the idea of state police, said: \u201cState police is one of the things that will restore peace to Nigeria. Nigerians should appeal to Mr. President to reconsider his stance on the issue.\u201d\n\nReacting, on the issue, Jonathan Asake, the National President of Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) said: \u201cLook at the banditry and terrorism going on in the North. If our hunters and vigilantes are supported and empowered, they will be able to flush them out. But the government of the day has not got the will to do that. Whether state police or not, the political will of the leadership is not there.\u201d\n\nOn the continuous call for the release of agitators, Essien and Pogu noted that if the President could allow political solution to be applied in resolving the issue of Boko Haram members who allegedly repented, by reintegrating some of them into the society and security forces, then what is good for the goose is good for the gander, in the case of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cOtherwise it might be construed that the President has special hatred for the South-East and the South as a whole. If the Boko Haram members are given amnesty and political solution, they are also murderers; so, it should apply also the Kanu,\u201d Pogu added.\n\nAsake lamented that whereas the Minister of Justice and Attorney General was quick to gazette the declaration of IPOB as a terrorist organization, he is only doing that of the bandits one month after, and tagged it a clear case of nepotism.\n\nAfenifere, YCE to Buhari: You\u2019re not being properly briefed\n\nFrom Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nFor restating his opposition to state police and restructuring, and for saying he would not consider any political solutions in the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), President Muhammadu Buhari has come under attack from the Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural and political organisation, Afenifere, and the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE).\n\nIn separate interviews with Saturday Sun on Friday, the two leading Yoruba groups contended that the statements made by Buhari during a recent interview, showed that he had either lost touch with reality, or he was not being properly briefed by people around him on the true situation of things in the country.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cIt\u2019s so sad that in spite of various advocacies that have been made, in spite of the appeals and agitations that have been made along this line, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria could still maintain the kind of stand he enunciated in his interview, because these are the areas where the solutions to the multi-various problems that Nigeria has, lie.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, also noted Buhari \u201cwas expressing his personal opinion and to my opinion, he has not been able to really see himself as combining his personal opinion with the headship of Nigerian state. So, one wonders if he is truly really very patriotic, as some of us have held him to be.\u201d\n\nOn restructuring, Afenifere stated that: \u201cThere is no way Nigeria can do without restructuring. So, it is a pity that Mr. President has not seen that.\u201d But YCE is pushing for a new constitution for the country, saying the 1999 constitution is a fraud and that the 1963 and 1958 Constitutions of Nigeria should be the way to go. He added that the new constitution would ensure restructuring of the country into a truly federal system.\n\nOlajide said: \u201cYou cannot compel us to live under a unitary system. In fact, I don\u2019t agree with restructuring because it really should be one of the byproducts of a new constitution. A new constitution is what will ease the problem of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nReacting to tBuhari\u2019s opposition to state police, Afenifere stated: \u201cBy saying no to state police, he is saying that Nigeria is no longer being run under a federal system because state police is a component of the federal system of government, which means each layer of government, federal, state and local should have their own security outfits. When I was growing up, I knew native authority police (akoda) of the native council, which is an equivalent of local governments today. It made taking care of security at the local level easier.\u201d\n\nBut for YCE, Olajide said: \u201cThere is no country in the world as diverse as Nigeria that has a centralized police system. One, Nigeria is made up of different ethnic groups with different culture, history, habits, backgrounds and religions. When you are bringing different people together to form a country, they must sit down to agree on the basis of their union. That is what gave birth to the United States in 1776. The 13 colonies had to sit together to agree on powers to be ceded to the centre and the powers that each of them would hold in the federating units. So, you cannot run Nigeria as under a unitary system of government and unitary system of security.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of no political solution to free self-determination agitators like Nnamdi Kanu and Chief Sunday Adeyemo, better known as Sunday Igboho, everything about that issue is political. For the president to say there is no political solution, it means he is not been realistic. He is not in touch with reality because the whole issue is political. This is giving us an impression that those who surround the president are not briefing him properly for him to be in touch with reality.\n\nAnd, through their spokesman, the Yoruba elders noted: \u201cThere is no where in the world where any president rules out political solution to a problem. Even, people who committed murder, they were granted amnesty after some time in incarceration. For me, such a blanket statement is misplaced. Igboho did not breach any of the Nigerian laws. He was exercising his fundamental human rights. He expressed his opinion that he wants his people to go with him to a separate country. It was his opinion. In United Kingdom, it happens that citizens can abuse the Prime Minister and nothing will happen. We never heard that Igboho killed anybody anywhere. So, for Igboho, it has to be a political solution. Though I don\u2019t know much about Nnamdi Kanu, the president cannot rule out political solution. It was not a mischief, but a misplaced statement.\u201d",

          "text": "*Say date in February still possible as 5 disgruntled members beg Abuja court for restraining order\n\n*Party set to deal with recalcitrant followers\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja, Charles Ajunwa in Lagos\n\nThe Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have summoned an emergency meeting in Abuja tomorrow to pick a date for the party\u2019s National Convention, in line with the advice of President Muhammadu Buhari that the party should put its house in order to avoid being kicked out by the opposition in 2023.\n\nThe Chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, who disclosed this yesterday after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, said \u201cthe party is still hopeful that a date in February is still feasible for the convention\u201d during which new national officers of the party would be elected.\n\nIn a related development, five aggrieved members of the APC have commenced legal action in Abuja, seeking an order to stop the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, from going ahead with the convention. This is the latest in the series of court cases rocking the party.\n\nLalong said the President\u2019s warning to the party that it risks losing power to the opposition, including the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), was a signal to the APC to have a seamless convention \u201cso that it will not disintegrate.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the President\u2019s warning was for the party to redouble its efforts and do the needful.\n\nLalong said: \u201cYou know when convention is coming, there will be fears here and there. Some people will tell you it will work,some will say it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday. By Sunday, we will tell you when we\u2019re holding the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think during our first date before Christmas, we said we\u2019re going to do the convention in February and we are still working on it. As far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThe President was raising his fears, but we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election. Some parties have done their own; the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from doing its own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, are also telling the governor\u2019s please do more, and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to keep our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss, but I\u2019m not drawing conclusion, but I always tell you that a political party is about interests, the interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\u201d\n\nLalong further assured that the meeting scheduled for tomorrow would address all the contending issues affecting the conduct of the convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.\n\n\u201cBut I just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonise all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping; that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss, I have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party, because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from this present government.\u201d\n\nOn whether the several court cases pending against the party and its leadership will not abort plans of the convention, the governor said: \u201cThere are procedures for holding court processes. Many of the court processes were there when we set up the caretaker committee, but up to this moment, if you go to take a census of some of the court proceedings, you will realise that a lot of them have been resolved out of court. So, it\u2019s still the duty of the party, it\u2019s still part of the functions of the party to resolve.\n\n\u201cBut we must not wait to resolve all court processes before you go to the convention. I don\u2019t think so because there are also machineries for resolving court processes, even after convention. I had a court process in my state, that did not stop me from going on and at the end of the day, we resolved the court process and we\u2019re still going on, preparing and waiting for convention.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC would meet the speculated February 5 date for the convention in view of the need for mandatory 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Lalong said \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the chairman of the convention committee, but I want to assure you that we\u2019ve called a meeting for Sunday and if there is a meeting on Sunday, and you\u2019re thinking about next Friday. Just wait and see what will happen before next Friday. I don\u2019t want to draw conclusions now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already talking of litigation, you draw conclusions, somebody will go and file a case tomorrow. So, I don\u2019t want us to draw a conclusion on that, but I want to assure you that we are meeting. We already sampled the minds of many of the governors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019re going to get a date and then with the admonition given by the President, it\u2019s a warning signal to all of us to sit up and ensure that we have a seamless, very clean, fair and transparent convention so that our party will not get disintegrated.\u201d\n\nAggrieved Members Move to Stop Convention\n\nFive aggrieved members of the APC yesterday commenced legal action to stop the planned National Convention of the party by dragging the CECPC, under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, before a Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe aggrieved members want the court to issue an order restraining the Buni-led CECPC from going ahead with the convention.\n\nRecall that some members of the APC are clamouring for a change in date of the scheduled national convention.\n\nThe suit dated January 4, 2022, has as plaintiffs, Suleiman Usman, Muhammed Shehu, Samaila Isahaka, Idris Isah and Audu Emmanuel.\n\nThe APC, Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were listed as 1-3 defendants in the court processes.\n\nThe plaintiffs are praying the court for an order to stop the convention on the grounds that state congresses are yet to be completed in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nLawyer to the plaintiffs, Olusola Ojo raised five questions for the court to determine and also sought eight declarative reliefs.\n\nOne of the reliefs included \u201can order of this Court restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants from organising and conducting the national convention of the 1st defendant unless state congresses of the 1st defendant were first concluded in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\u201d\n\nAPC Set to Deal With Erring Members\n\nWith the National Convention of the APC being threatened by a plethora of crises, the ruling party may have resolved to come down hard on some erring members to ensure discipline and position the APC to retain power in 2023, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAPC\u2019s planned disciplinary actions are said to be fully supported by President Buhari who wants to leave behind a peaceful and united party in 2023.\n\nAccording to the President, the ruling party would shoot itself in the foot if \u201cit fails to resolve the disunity and lack of agreement amongst members of the party.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the decision of the party to sanction some erring members is in tandem with the President\u2019s position to instill discipline within the party.\n\nA source close to the APC National Secretariat in Abuja, who preferred anonymity, said the APC was considering \u201cvery serious and severe disciplinary measures against some people whose activities and utterances are threats to the health of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source adds: \u201cI can tell you categorically that the party is coming down heavily on some party members whose actions are becoming dangerous for the unity of the party. Some of the individuals involved are high-profile.\n\n\u201cI am aware of two governors that have been pencilled down for disciplinary action. One is from the North-west while the other is from the South-west. The governors are said to be throwing stones at the party through their agents. Also, two former governors who are working against the APC secretly have been identified and will be sanctioned at the appropriate time. Also, some Senators and House of Representatives members are fingered in a secret report at the disposal of the party.\n\n\u201cA minister from the South-east was also said to have been working against the interest of the party. The party may soon unmask these characters and deal decisively with them.\u201d\n\nThe source further said \u201ca meeting will be scheduled shortly to address this matter.\u201d\n\nAccording to insiders at the party\u2019s headquarters, the desperation of some individuals, especially aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the party, and groups within the APC remain a big threat to the peace and stability of the party.\n\nAnother highly ranked member of the party, who does not want his name mentioned, wondered why some aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the APC want to \u201cderail the party at this critical period instead of helping to build it and consolidate on the gains so far achieved by the Buhari government.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThere has to be APC first for these aspirants to realise their aspirations. APC is a big family and it has the capacity to accommodate all interests. Buni is working tirelessly to hold the party together and he needs the support of every stakeholder in order to take the party to greater heights. Buni is not contesting for the party\u2019s chairmanship seat. He will be seeking reelection in Yobe State as second term governor.\n\n\u201cSome political parties have predicted that APC will implode. But I have good news for them \u2013 APC will never implode. It\u2019s one united family. We have internal mechanisms we use in settling matters with dispatch. APC is the party to beat in 2023.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a group within the APC called Progressive Initiative For Change and Development has called on the leadership of the APC to ensure all crises in the party are resolved amicably before any National Convention is conducted.\n\nThe National Coordinator of the Group, Chief Donatus Okereke told journalists in Abuja that the party was clearly not ready for a National Convention with the crisis engulfing some state chapters, urging the national leaders of the party to ensure \u201cproper and thorough reconciliation\u201d before any National Convention is staged.\n\nPGF DG Calls for Buni\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Director General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Lukman Salihu has called on Buni and the Secretary of the party\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe to resign honourably if they can\u2019t conclude preparations for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nLukman stated this in a letter dated January 5, 2022 titled, \u201cAPC National Convention: Urgent Matters for the Survival of APC,\u201d and addressed to the Chairman of PGF and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State.\n\nThe director-general also copied President Buhari and key party leaders in the letter which was sighted by THISDAY.\n\nLukman recalled that on Monday, January 3, 2022, he sent an open letter to all APC leaders titled \u201cPlausibility of February 2022 APC Convention\u201d, which highlighted some of the reasons the APC National Convention should not be postponed.\n\nThe party chieftain pointed out that leaders of the party must understand that the survival of the party was at stake and any attempt to continue to contemplate postponement of the Convention means gambling with the future of the party, which he said was unacceptable.\n\nThe party chieftain said the failure of the Buni-led Committee to implement decisions makes APC leaders complicit and therefore agreeable to acts that are injurious to the survival of the party.\n\nAccording to him, the insinuation in the public is that the reluctance of Buni to proceed with implementation of the decision to hold the APC National Convention on February 5, 2022 as agreed was because governors want to continue to control the party, which to the best of my knowledge is not true.\n\nLukman stressed that some commentators both within the party and in the public have argued that there are deliberate efforts to prevent the convention from holding on February 5, 2022, which was why the CECPC did not make any public announcement or begin to make any preparation.\n\nThe director-general said that APC leaders should imagine the consequences of ruining the electoral potentials of the party in 2023 such that beyond losing the federal government, self-implicated legal challenges are created to weaken the electoral prospects of the party simply because of actions or inactions of the CECPC, especially Buni and Akpanudoedehe.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has mandated the Board of the newly incorporated Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, to ensure that the firm focuses on profitability and operates at par with its industry peers across the world, \u201cwhile acting as enabler company that will foster the development of other sectors of our economy.\u201d\n\nInaugurating the Board chaired by Senator Margery Chuba Okadigbo, at the State House, Abuja yesterday, the President also charged them to ensure that NNPC strictly complies with Corporate Governance principles that place premium on doing business with the highest ethical standards, integrity, and transparency.\n\nBuhari said: \u201dThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited is mandated to focus on profitability and continuous value creation beyond the simple fulfilment of legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n\u201dNNPC Limited is expected to operate at par with its industry peers across the world, while acting as Enabler Company that will foster the development of other sectors of our Economy.\n\n\u201dThe inauguration of this Board is a major step in the ongoing transition to a more viable petroleum industry that will attract investment to support our economic growth and generate employment to millions of our people\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201dI expect the NNPC Limited to be mindful of our commitments to net carbon zero aspirations and to ensure total alignment with the global energy transition realities.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari reminded the Board members that they came on board sequel to the reforms put forward by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, which seeks to reposition the Nigerian petroleum industry to a commercially viable and competitive industry in line with global business dynamics and best practices.\n\nThe President directed that there should be full alignment and synergy between NNPC Limited, the Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority in compliance with the provisions of the law in all respects to deliver the onerous reforms envisaged for the energy industry.\n\nWhile thanking the leadership and members of the National Assembly for their seamless support in the journey towards a viable, accountable and transparent energy industry, the President said he would count on the professional insights and ethical conduct of the Board members to ensure the delivery of his administration\u2019s promises to Nigerians.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said under the present administration a lot had been achieved in the petroleum industry, including the signing of the PIA, the registration of NNPC Limited as a CAMA company and the inauguration of the Board of the NNPC Limited.\n\n\u201dMr. President, this is history in the making because this is the first time any President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is inaugurating an independent board of an independent NNPC Limited. This, however, puts a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of those inaugurated and those of us in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nApart from the Chairman, Senator Okadigbo, other members of the Board inaugurated include Mele Kolo Kyari, Chief Executive Officer; Umar I.

          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday raised the alarm that many Nigerian youths \u201care enlisting in violent groups and kidnap gangs\u201d owing to unemployment and the inability of government to manage the country\u2019s population.\n\nObasanjo, who was speaking at the Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe symposium in Lagos, also expressed worry about the country\u2019s growing population, especially the unemployed youths.\n\nHe said political will and action were key to transforming the country\u2019s population into an asset.\n\nObasanjo further raised a number of critical questions concerning how to manage Nigeria\u2019s rising population: \u201cFirst cluster of questions are: How are we going to feed this growing population?

Former coach Gernot Rohr was loyal \u2014 arguably to a fault \u2014 to Maduka Okoye, who performed well for Nigeria at the qualifiers.\n\nBut Akpeyi could well be the man to usurp him. The Kaizer Chiefs goalie has plenty of swagger, bags of confidence in his own ability and unquestionable talent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaduka Okoye\n\nOkoye\u2019s stock has continuously been on the rise since he made his debut against Brazil in 2019, so much so that he has been a regular in the role in recent times.\n\nThe former Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf keeper started in the 2-0 win over Coton Sports and should continue against Egypt.\n\nFrancis Uzoho\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInjuries and poor form cost the Aspire Football Academy product his place as the undisputed number one goalie of the Super Eagles.\n\nUzoho enjoyed a good season at Omonia Nicosia before linking up with the three-time African champions.\n\nJohn Noble\n\nIt would be a turn-up for the books if Noble manages to leapfrog his three rivals to the No 1 shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Enyimba third choice goalie would have to seriously impress in training to be thrown in against Egypt on January 11 in the opening game \u2014 but stranger things have been known to happen.\n\nBarring any surprises, Noble will be the fourth choice keeper and is unlikely to be given any game time.\n\nDefenders\n\nChidozie Awaziem\n\nAwaziem is a rock at the back and full of confidence after an outstanding season at Alanyaspor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOla Aina\n\nIt will be a real battle between Aina and Tyrone Ebuehi for the right-back berth but the games come thick and fast, so both may have their time to shine.\n\nOlisa Ndah\n\nHow many sleepless nights did Eguavoen have about this selection?\n\nThe Orlando Pirates defender has been tipped by many to star in Cameroon, and it will be fascinating to see where he is deployed.\n\nHis main strengths are his range of passing and creativity but there have been question marks about his defending in the past. He\u2019ll be desperate to prove the naysayers wrong on the big stage and justify his selection.\n\nTyrone Ebuehi\n\nEbuehi has been rewarded for his superb season with Venezia in Italy. He should provide competition to Ola Aina.\n\nSemi Ajayi\n\nThe West Bromwich Albion defender is a hugely popular man in the English Championship.\n\nHe is unlikely to start but if any of the central defenders pick up an injury, he\u2019ll fancy his chances of being drafted in.\n\nZaidu Sanusi\n\nSanusi has the experience of playing the UEFA Champions League for FC Porto and this should help Nigeria at AFCON.\n\nWilliam Troost-Ekong\n\nThe Super Eagles vice-captain isn\u2019t having the best of times at Watford. He will be keen to silence his doubters when the Super Eagles take to the pitch.\n\nKenneth Omeruo\n\nKenneth Omeruo is deserving of his place in the line-up after a good season at Leganes.\n\nHe should pair with William Troost-Ekong in the heart of defence.\n\nJamilu Collins\n\nOne of the favourites of Gernot Rohr, Collins arrived at camp late and should play some part at the tourney.\n\nMidfielders\n\nJoe Aribo\n\nThe Rangers man is one of the most exciting talents available to Nigeria and his reputation is such that Premier League clubs want him.\n\nAlex Iwobi\n\nTournament football can be so tight, hard-fought and sometimes decided with one moment of genius. It would be no surprise to see Iwobi deliver when it matters. There\u2019s plenty of competition for places in his position but leaving him out would be a brave call.\n\nIwobi has been underrated for some time but there is no disputing his ability.\n\nWilfred Ndidi\n\nNdidi typifies everything great about the Leicester City team of the past few years.\n\nHe is at the root of their swashbuckling play and so at ease on the ball.\n\nThe Nath Boys product has gone on to become a magnificent player and leader for club and country.\n\nKelechi Nwakali\n\nNwakali is a well-rounded midfielder who is able to work hard defensively and contribute in transition.\n\nHe is the heartbeat of his Huesca side and will want to be the same for Nigeria.\n\nFrank Onyeka\n\nThe jewel in Brentford\u2019s crown, Onyeka has enhanced his reputation as one of the Super Eagles\u2019 best midfielders. He is likely to be used as a defensive shield for those at the back and will have his work cut out for him, especially against the top sides.\n\nAttackers\n\nTaiwo Awoniyi\n\nThe Union Berlin striker is exceptional in the air, leaps like the proverbial salmon and started the season on fire.\n\nHe has notched 14 goals in all competitions this term and could relish a role when the Super Eagles are desperate to find a breakthrough.\n\nKelechi Iheanacho\n\nThe striker is already an integral part of the Super Eagles team and has everything it takes to light up the AFCON.\n\nIheanacho has bags of ability but it remains to be seen where Cerezo will play him.\n\nHenry Onyekuru\n\nIf Onyekuru can return anywhere near his best, the Olympiacos man might be one of the squad\u2019s best players.\n\nThe Super Eagles have been crying out for ball-playing wingers for years and suddenly have four at once!\n\nAhmed Musa\n\nMusa will have to up his game to cement a spot in the starting side. He has a tendency to snatch at some big chances and has plenty in his tank.\n\nSadiq Umar\n\nA shining light in good form for Almeria, Umar is a brilliant player with the world at his feet.\n\nAgain, his role is likely to be from the bench but if he can translate club performances onto the training pitch, he could make it difficult for Eguavoen to leave him out.\n\nMoses Simon\n\nSimon has a box of tricks to beat defenders and is capable of jaw-dropping moments.\n\nAny opposition full-back seeing Simon\u2019s name on the team sheet will know he\u2019s in for a long day\u2019s work and there will be fierce competition for places in Nigeria\u2019s attack so he will know he has to perform to keep his spot.\n\nSamuel Chukwueze\n\nOn his day, Chukwueze can be a game-changer and one of the best wingers in African football but Eguavoen must find a way to drag it out of him.\n\nChidera Ejuke\n\nThe CSKA Moscow man played in the middle of the park against Coton Sports and didn\u2019t look out of sorts. It appears that the skilful Ejuke might play a role at the 33rd AFCON.\n\nPeter Olayinka\n\nOlayinka steps onto the pitch and plays as though he hasn\u2019t got a care in the world.\n\nFor some reason, it has taken a while for the Slavia Praha man to be given the credit he deserves but there\u2019s no doubting his immense talent and more importantly, his ability to pop up with big goals.",

It appears that the skilful Ejuke might play a role at the 33rd AFCON.\n\nPeter Olayinka\n\nOlayinka steps onto the pitch and plays as though he hasn\u2019t got a care in the world.\n\nFor some reason, it has taken a while for the Slavia Praha man to be given the credit he deserves but there\u2019s no doubting his immense talent and more importantly, his ability to pop up with big goals.",

          "title": "'It will cause mass hunger, hardship' -- NLC rejects new tax on carbonated drinks",
          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has rejected the federal government\u2019s introduction of N10/litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, had announced the new tax on Wednesday.\n\nAhmed said the new tax would raise revenue for health-related and other critical expenditures.\n\nBut in a statement, Ayuba Wabba, president of NLC, wondered why the government did not place the excise duties on sugar itself as a commodity rather than on carbonated drinks, adding that the health reason proffered by the government for the re-introduction of the excise duties \u201cseems altruistic\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the tax would impose more hardship on the people, especially on \u201cordinary Nigerians who easily keep hunger at bay with a bottle of soft drink and maybe a loaf of bread\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur concern is the mass hunger that would result from the slightest increase in the retail price of soft drinks owing to the imposition of excise duties as it would be priced beyond the reach of many Nigerians,\u201d Wabba said.\n\n\u201cCongress was also alerted by the complaint of manufacturers of soft drinks in Nigeria that the re-introduction of excise duties would lead to a very sharp decline in sales, forced reduction in production capacity, and a certain roll back in investments with the certainty of job losses and possibly shut down of manufacturing plants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNigerians would recall that this was also the complaint of tyre manufacturing companies such as Dunlop and Michelin which was overlooked by the government until the two companies relocated to neighbouring Ghana.\n\n\u201cA similar situation is playing out with the soft drinks manufacturing sub-sector. Government should pay attention.\n\n\u201cWith 38% of the entire manufacturing output in Nigeria and 22.5% share representation of the entire manufacturing sector in Nigeria, the food and beverage industry is the largest industrial sub-sector in our country. The food and beverage sub-sector has generated to the coffers of government N202 billion as VAT in the past five years, N7.3 billion as Corporate Social Responsibility, and has created 1.5 million decent jobs both directly and indirectly.\n\n\u201cThere is thus no gainsaying the fact that the industry is a golden goose that must be kept alive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said an additional increase in the retail price of carbonated drinks would put more Nigerians at risk of serious health challenges as many people would resort to consuming sub-standard drinks as substitutes for carbonated drinks.\n\n\u201cThe appeal to rescind the re-introduction of excise duties on non-alcoholic drinks becomes even more compelling when the projected immediate revenue expected from the policy is weighed against the potential long-term loss to both manufacturers and government. The beverage sub-sector will lose 40% of its current sales revenue,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis translates to a loss of N1.9 trillion. While the government will only make total projected receipts of N81 billion from the proposed re-introduction of the excise duties. The government also stands to lose N197 billion in VAT, Company Income Tax and Tertiary Education Tax as a consequence of the expected downturn in overall industry performance should the excise duties be effected as being planned\u201d.\n\nNLC, therefore, asks the national assembly to quickly amend the sections of the Finance Act that re-introduced excise duties on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApart from NLC, several stakeholders, including the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), had faulted the decision, saying the new tax will cause loss of jobs.",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, the highest grossing nollywood movie in 2021 and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven to a casual observer, 2021 was a massive year for the African tech ecosystem. It was the year when there were more disclosed funding rounds than we could keep up with. Data from various sources show that startups on the continent received over $4 billion from investors in 2021. That represents more than double the investments gotten in 2020.\n\nNumbers, they say, don\u2019t lie, and with help from Briter Bridges\u2019 Africa Investment Report 2021 and data from Africa: The Big Deal, we\u2019ll be extracting some insights.\n\nFunding for women-led startups needs to be better\n\nMuch has been written about the near absence of financing for women-led startups. While startup funding continues to grow, it is still disproportionately skewed towards startups led by men or at least one man on the founding team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOdunayo Eweniyi, Co-founder, FirstCheck Africa\n\nThe Big Deal reports that only 0.95% of the funding raised by African startups went to startups founded or led by a woman. While this percentage is less than that of 2020 (2%), it is partly explained by the fact that funding raised in 2021 was 2.5x more than 2020\u2019s figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that while the total amount raised by women is increasing, the percentage of funding going to startups founded or led by women is on the decline from 4% in 2019 to 0.95% in 2021.\n\nTo be fair, women worldwide have a harder time raising money than men, and with Africa\u2019s startup scene in its early stages, that is to be expected. However, more can and should be done to fund African startups founded by women. Fortunately, it seems more investors are willing to do this with firms like FirstCheck Africa providing funds for female founders.\n\nFintech reigned supreme\n\nAs has been the case in the last few years, fintech startups received the bulk of funding in 2021. According to Briter Bridges, 62% (~$2.9 billion) of total funding in African startups went to fintech startups, double the 31% recorded in 2020.\n\nHealthtech and Biotech follow closely at 8%, with logistics (7%), education (5%), and cleantech (5%) rounding up the top five sectors by investment value. With payments still posing a problem for businesses and individuals, fintech looks set to retain its place as a preferred destination for investment in Africa for a while.\n\nFour countries still dominated\n\nJust like fintech and men dominate funding received, the Big Four \u2013 Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya \u2013 still dominate Africa\u2019s funding scene. For example, Nigeria alone accounts for a whopping $1.5 billion of the total funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax AB, an Egyptian eCommerce startup raised a $55 million Series A across two rounds in 2021.\n\nOne country that is worth talking about is Egypt. With 562 active tech startups, it sits behind only Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya as the countries with the most startups in Africa. Startups in the country also showed significant growth in terms of the amount of funding they received. However, Briter Bridges\u2019 report shows a growing interest in Francophone Africa, inspired, perhaps by Wave\u2019s unicorn status.\n\nMore $100+ million deals\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear of deals exceeding $100 million in Africa. Even when they happen, they are often mergers and acquisitions, but 2021 saw the highest number of $100+ million deals ever. There were 12 deals worth at least $100 million, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total funding value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSome startups that raised at least $100 million include Andela, $200 million Series E; Flutterwave, $170 million Series C; Chipper Cash, $250 million Series C across two separate rounds; OPay, $400 million Series C; Trade Depot, $110 million Series B; and Jumo, $400 million led by Fidelity Management & Research Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign investments dominate, but local investors stepped up.\n\nSo far, foreign investors still dominate funding for African startups. Briter Bridges reports that the United States and the United Kingdom lead the way. In Africa, South Africa and Mauritius are the top two countries where local investors have their headquarters. Asian investors are not left out with growing interest from Singaporean, Chinese, and Japanese investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nHowever, local African investors are increasingly stepping up activities. In 2021, several African investors threw their hats in the ring or raised new funds. Some of these investors include Ventures Platform, Savannah Fund, FirstCheck Africa, LoftyInc Capital, and Flat6Labs.\n\nOn a lighter note, some of the things that stand out include the fact that about 43% of startup founders have their alma mater on the continent. I may be reaching, but I believe this helps them tap into a wider network when raising money for their startups, considering most of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from outside the continent. However, it is also a reminder that Africa\u2019s education system still has a long way to go before it catches up with its Western counterparts.\n\nWith the heights reached by African startups in 2021, it is logical to expect them to be matched and hopefully eclipsed in 2022. Only time will tell, but 2022 looks set to see more growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

In 2021, for instance, approximately $5 billion was raised by startups across the continent. Interestingly, this exceeded 2020\u2019s investment and is almost four times what was raised five years ago. This demonstrates how much the fintech space has evolved in recent years.\n\nMoreso, the fintech industry is reshaping and simplifying our lives. Who would have predicted a decade ago that Point of Sale (PoS), and mobile and Internet banking would be a part of our everyday lives?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 2021 was a great year for fintech startups, 2022 could hold more. What do you think? We don\u2019t know what 2022 will bring, but we can see the future by looking into the past.\n\nHere\u2019s Emmanuel Paul\u2019s take on that: Nigerian fintech predictions for 2022: Dollar exchanges go the way of Bitcoin.\n\nPlease read and leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nLinkedIn to launch a Clubhouse rival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn, a professional network service, is launching a new events platform to list, host, and market interactive, virtual live events. It will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end without the need for any other third-party software.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means users can record and run the event directly from LinkedIn, featuring tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and moderate discussions. Attendees can also communicate with each other during and after events.\n\nThe new events platform will begin with an audio-only product \u2014 clubhouse-style audio events \u2014 released in beta this January. This will follow a video version that will be released in March 2022. However, it will be targeting users who use LinkedIn to connect with a larger audience.\n\nHave we seen this before? This is similar to Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, but with content geared towards career development, professional topics, and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.\n\nRemember that LinkedIn shut down Stories in September 2021, partly because LinkedIn discovered that users didn\u2019t want disappearing videos. In addition, Twitter, a social media giant, discontinued Fleets, its Stories-like product, in 2021. Twitter discovered that users did not respond to short videos in the way they had hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2021, LinkedIn confirmed that it has been working on a Clubhouse rival to cultivate a larger and more active Creator community. Over the last year, the company has also been experimenting with other features that it may add to this events service, such as a paid, ticketed option which will be launched as a free service for the time being.\n\nJABU\u2019s $3.2 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce startup, JABU, has confirmed the closing of $3.2 million in seed funding to assist small retailers in ordering and stocking their products while also providing data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAfore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, among other unnamed investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nSuppliers who use the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators, and book merchandising. They can also run advertising and marketing campaigns, hold product giveaways, and generate merchandising revenue.\n\nIntriguingly, the company, which operates in three Namibian cities and has recently expanded into two Zambian cities, is planning a Series A fundraising round this quarter.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy 2022 Is the Year We Learn to Live With COVID-19.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf 2021 was an amazing trip for Nigerian fintechs, then 2022 could be a blast off to space. That\u2019s how significant the exponential growth in the fintech space has been in recent years, and it creates room for bullishness in the space. But then, no one can see the future, and we can only use past experiences to gauge future expectations.\n\nFor instance, Nigerian fintech funding in 2021, $800 million, was 120% higher than funding in the last three years combined. Also, there are new dimensions to our understanding of fintech companies.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API fintech companies, which we examined closely. In 2021, we saw the launch of an open banking framework and lending companies deepen their tentacles in the Nigerian market.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what to expect, but for the fifth year running, Adedeji Olowe, a Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria, has made interesting predictions for the fintech space in 2022. While you can find the predictions on his website, our tradition for the past two years has been to give them relevant context and leave you with the caveat: No one can really predict the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom foreign exchange disruptions, expected acquisitions, and a new KYC king, here\u2019s a peek behind the curtains for Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions for 2022.\n\nThe market goes super-hot. New unicorns are born. Old players die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nIn 2021, Africa minted five unicorns, two of which were Nigerian fintech companies. With $800 million in fintech funding in 2021 and the CBN licensing new payment services providers, Olowe believes there will be heavy competition in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe market becomes competitive like crazy; fintechs would use dollars as weapons to snap talents and do marketing; larger and ballsy fintechs may start doing their APIs directly, bypassing Mono and others. When the smoke clears, the battlefield would be full of dead bodies,\u201d he declared.\n\nOlowe maintains that the aftermath of this battle would see new players crowned unicorns and any of the older players born before 2015 sink.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to reflect on here that hasn\u2019t been said already, but in these kinds of battles, the only clear winner is usually the customer. The only exceptions would be cases of companies using severely unethical practices to gain a competitive advantage. In this case, the media\u2019s watchful eye will be very important.\n\nA global giant comes to play; I will pay you with WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStripe came in 2020 to buy Paystack but not to play. But in 2022, my blurry eyes see a global player coming to play big time,\u201d Olowe says.\n\nThough Africa has witnessed much growth in recent years, most global tech giants do not take the African market seriously. But we began to see a shift last year, with Google playing a major role and launching a $1 billion fund to build giant subsea cables and fund startups, among others.\n\nLast year, we saw TechCrunch hire its first African reporter to increase its coverage of Africa. Also, in 2021, Apple appointed a country manager for Nigeria and Twitter opened its first African office. However, these moves do not show full intent to set up shop in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle and Apple stores are unavailable in Nigeria; PayPal still only allows Nigerians to send money. It appears the market is still too nascent for most prominent players, so why would a global fintech player come in?\n\n\u201cThe market is hot as hell; alternative payments methods, such as virtual accounts, have proven to be very successful. API players like OnePipe and Mono are doing very well and shipping data around like smugglers, and lastly, open banking would go live once the standards are approved by the CBN. There is simply no better time to be here,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHe\u2019s betting that WhatsApp comes back with payments and could build on their shaky launch in Brazil and India with a push for the African market.\n\nRecall that when WhatsApp launched its payment service in Brazil earlier in 2021, the country\u2019s central bank put a hold on things. It\u2019s unlikely that WhatsApp\u2019s payment play would be good news to existing banks and fintech players.\n\nConsidering how Paystack and Flutterwave helped trigger a wave of startups in Nigeria, would global players\u2019 entry into the Nigerian market open the doors to more big tech players in other sectors?\n\nVisa and Mastercard acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe made this prediction in 2021, and remains adamant that both moves make perfect sense for the two major incumbents of global payments services.\n\n\u201cNaira is at an all-time low, and Interswitch fundamentals are anchored on the naira, which makes them cheaper and because they are a grown-ass fintech, they can\u2019t enjoy the 20x EBITDA multiple that smaller and younger fintechs use for their valuation. But then, they are a behemoth, and they control 90%+ of ISO card traffic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSide note: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) multiples are used to calculate startup valuations, and it varies depending on the growth potential perceived in that industry. For instance, a tech company would have a higher EBITDA multiple than a manufacturing company because of the perceived growth potential.\n\nSo far, Mastercard has dominated more in Nigeria, and Olowe believes Visa\u2019s next big play would be to buy Interswitch. Considering Interswitch\u2019s influence, he insists that the only option is for Mastercard to acquire Visa.\n\nMTN launches PSB and blows everyone away\n\nTelco-led mobile money has not gained much traction compared to Kenya and Ghana. Nigerian telcos have struggled to get a banking licence from the CBN, and though 9mobile and Glo received theirs in 2019, other players like TeamApt and OPay have stolen the headlines.\n\nLeveraging a strong belief in the execution prowess of MTN\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, Olowe predicted that MTN would finally get a PSB licence in 2021, and it did, alongside Airtel.\n\n\u201cMTN would drive its PSB so hard and super agents so amazingly, they would quickly suck the oxygen out of the market. \u201cI expect a rapid decimation of Super Agents when MTN\u2019s PSB goes live,\u201d Olowe declared.\n\nOlowe\u2019s bullishness is not without good cause. He explains to Techpoint that MTN has a history of executing with surgical precision, aptly exemplified by their dominance of the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets.\n\nWith 73.6 million subscribers, MTN controls 38% of Nigeria\u2019s telecom market. But that\u2019s not the whole story. At its annual general meeting in September 2021, it announced that it had 88% nationwide network coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super curious about who Karl would anoint as the CEO of the bank, though; I smell some ex orange-coloured EDs who know all the tricks of the traditional banks and where dead bodies can be buried,\u201d Olowe mused.\n\nThe reference to ex orange-coloured executive directors seemingly points to Guaranty Trust Bank, with its orange-themed colours. But it\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nPer Olowe, MTN would also learn of the difficulties of working with two regulators, the CBN and the NCC, one of which is very strict.\n\nIn Ghana, MTN\u2019s mobile money dominance triggered legislative actions in 2020, to stem a monopoly. While that\u2019s a possibility in Nigeria, the market is way bigger and more competitive.\n\nFree transfers and realisation of financial inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the CBN implemented policies that reduced transaction fees for bank transfers, but nothing happened in 2021. For Olowe, this could either be a prediction or a wishlist, as he maintains that if it doesn\u2019t come to pass on its own, he will devote his energy to making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\u201cMake transfers below a certain amount free for everyone, and you have a good chance of bringing financial inclusion to every Nigerian,\u201d he argues, saying that \u201cThe last time the cost of transfer went down to \u20a610, the market jumped like drops of water inside hot oil.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, free transfers would largely benefit people with bank accounts and drive cashless adoption, but that might only be the starting point for financial inclusion. Credit and insurance remain big mountains to climb for financial inclusion, but free transfers would not hurt the vision at all.\n\nLending becomes hot; bigger banks jump in and get shocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by Lendsqr, a lending tech startup, Nigeria has a \u20a674 trillion lending gap across SME lending, asset, smartphone, laptop, education, vehicle, and mortgage financing. Despite the regulatory attention being directed towards unethical players, the space is still exploding.\n\nAs a result of this opportunity, Olowe holds that five of Nigeria\u2019s top ten banks would delve into the lending space without looking and, consequently, have disastrous experiences.\n\n\u201cThey will fail because their loans would be packed like corporate bank credits.\u201d\n\nOpen banking goes live. API players are shaken off the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API-fintech startups such as Okra, Mono, and OnePipe, which have all raised impressive amounts of funding. In 2021, the CBN launched an open banking framework, and Olowe believes it will go live in 2022.\n\n\u201cNow, open banking is significantly more comprehensive, faster, and safer than the APIs being sold. And because only licensed players would be allowed, the market may shake some old API providers out the way mobile Internet killed business centres,\u201d he argues.\n\nOlowe is a Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria and has been deeply involved in ensuring open APIs become a reality in Nigeria. If you\u2019re not sure how open APIs work or what an API is, check out the analogy in this piece.\n\n\u201cAPI fintechs are seen as the broker between two parties. How? By accepting messages from the sender, passing them as requests to the receiver, and returning data to the sender. Similarly, via API calls, users can request information from the broker at any time,\u201d reads an excerpt from our previous article.\n\nThough Olowe holds this position, Abdul Hassan, Mono CEO, maintains that API fintechs are building the infrastructure to enable open banking. There\u2019s more.\n\nIf you have any interest in fintech, then check out the two articles linked in this section and either keep a close eye on proceedings or become an active player yourself.\n\nNIN dethrones BVN. CBN\u2019s fear comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Bank Verification Number (BVN) is a unique identifier for every user of financial services in Nigeria. To date, there are over 51.8 million registered BVNs in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, citing the misuse of the BVN, the CBN clamped down on several fintech providers and limited access to the BVN. However, this move coincided with the resurgence of the National Identity Number (NIN), which had enrolled over 71 million people as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe NIN is increasingly becoming the digital identity of choice, but there are some question marks around its security.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is NIN being government property means data security and privacy may be poor. Soon, a major breach happens, and DSS is called to fish out fintech founders,\u201d Olowe surmised.\n\nDigital identity has been a significant problem for most Nigerian businesses, and while enrollments for the NIN are skyrocketing with the help of private companies, questions around security would have to be addressed. With the presence of VerifyMe and Youverify, there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about on this front in 2022.\n\nFX goes the crypto way. P2P FX transactions power investment apps. CBN is upset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2021, the CBN clamped down on several companies operating anything remotely connected to foreign transactions. It started in 2020. The naira\u2019s value was in free-fall against the dollar, and the country\u2019s apex bank was taking no prisoners as it dealt brutal blows to any party it deemed responsible.\n\nIt came after remittance services providers, mobile money operators, then it went after crypto startups, next was the investment tech startups, and soon after, FX platform, abokifx.com. With many Nigerians shopping online and interacting with several foreign websites, there\u2019s still pressure on the naira.\n\nOlowe believes that these clampdowns could lead to a P2P play by FX dealers, a move that saved the crypto space from regulatory scrutiny, for better or for worse.\n\n\u201cWhile some investment apps may have gotten an injunction to prevent CBN from locking their accounts up, trust them to throw a party if P2P can save their business model,\u201d Olowe stated.\n\nSo there you have it.

          "title": "How 10 Nigerian startups have fared after Y Combinator funding",
          "text": "Since 2016, when Y Combinator made its first investment in Nigerian-based Flutterwave, it has not looked back. It now counts 30 Nigerian tech companies as part of its portfolio.\n\nYear on year, the startup accelerator runs two categories of funding projects known as the summer (S) and winter (W) batches, and some beneficiaries including Nigerian owned startups- 54Gene, Mono, Paystack, Flutterwave, Helium Health, among others have participated.\n\nFounded in March 2005, Y Combinator is a famous startup accelerator, which selects tech startups to take part in its programme twice yearly. Seed funding is the accelerator\u2019s earliest stage of venture funding used to pay companies\u2019 expenses while getting started.\n\nWhile some companies may need no more than seed funding, others go through several rounds. For the purpose of this, 10 startups who have featured in Y Combinator\u2019s funding are being highlighted in terms of their expansion and acquisitions.\n\nNigeria accounts for 50 percent of the 60 tech companies from Africa that have received funding from Y Combinator. Out of the 30 are Nigerian-based and owned companies, fintechs make up 50 percent, healthtech-16.6 percent, Agritech-10 percent, crypto, logistics and autotech-6.6 percent each, while edutech makes up 3.3 percent.\n\nWe looked at how ten of the startups have grown since they got investment from Y Combinator.\n\n54Gene (healthtech)\n\n54Gene participated in the W19 funding project shortly after its inception in 2019 by Abasi Ene-Obong and Ogochukwu Francis Osifo. 54Gene is African genomics research, services, and development company that addresses the need to include under-represented African genomic data in research that could lead to medical breakthroughs and new healthcare solutions worldwide.\n\nThe startup raised $150,000 twice in March 2019 as its first funding, and is seen to be making progress. It made the Time Magazine list of 12 innovations that would change healthcare in the 2020s and was listed as one of five innovations that would improve healthcare for Africans.\n\nIn January 2021, it unveiled a new lab in Lagos, capable of human whole-genome sequencing and a variety of other scientific investigations, and started operations immediately. This is to enable Africans to conduct genomics research. In September 2021, 54Gene announced it raised $25 million in a Series B funding round which happens to be their latest funding.\n\nHelium Health (healthtech)\n\nHelium Health provides a range of technology for healthcare providers, payers and patients across Africa which include maiden electronic medical records (EMR) and hospital management information system (HMIS) for emerging markets.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Adegoke Olubisi as \u2018One medical\u2019, the company was accepted into Y Combinator having joined the S17 funding batch and rebranded to Helium Health in May 2017 and a two million seed round was closed in the same year.\n\nIn 2018, Helium health launched its EMR product widely to great adoption by private and public facilities across Nigeria which led to their acquisition of MedicPlus and SmartDoctor who are EMR providers in Nigeria.\n\nWith a total of $12.2 million in funding over 5 rounds, the company recently acquired Meddy on November 10, 2021.\n\nCowrywise (fintech)\n\nCowrywise leverages technology and investment management to re-imagine how financial planning, savings, and investment products are delivered to people in a simple, secure and affordable manner.\n\nCo-founded by Razaq Ahmed and Edward Popoola in 2017, Cowrywise has raised a total of $3.3 million in funding over 6 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on January 28, 2021, from a Seed round.\n\nAfter its participation in S18 of Y Combinator\u2019s funding, the company launched various retail investment schemes, and it says it now has up to 21 mutual funds with various risk categories, and up to 300,000 people now use Cowrywise in 2021.\n\nA major milestone for the company was when it secured an asset management licence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This enabled the company to manage funds and investment portfolios on behalf of retail investors, as only companies with such a licence can develop and operate any product that pools investor funds.\n\nPaystack (fintech)\n\nPaystack as a fintech company allows businesses to accept payments via credit card, debit card, money transfer, and mobile money on their websites or mobile applications.\n\nFounded in 2015, co-founders include Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, with its total funding raised at $10.4 million over five rounds as of August 2018, after it joined the W16 funding batch.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Paystack by Stripe in October 2020, the company relaunched its eCommerce store for sole entrepreneurs and small businesses, updated a feature for subscription-based businesses to better track customer cards that are about to expire, and has become a payment option for vendors\n\nusing WooCommerce, a plug-in owned by WordPress.\n\nIn September 2021, Paystack became the first payment gateway in Africa to become an Apple Pay partner. The integration allowed businesses that use Paystack to receive payments from 380 million Apple Pay users in about 60 countries.\n\nFlutterwave (fintech)\n\nFlutterwave is a payment company that enables businesses to make and accept payments from anywhere in Africa. It participated in the S16 funding batch months after it began operations.\n\nCo-founded by Olugbenga Agboola and Iyinioluwa Aboyeji in 2016, Flutterwave has grown to become one of the fastest-growing payments companies in the world. Since its inception, Flutterwave has processed close to $2 billion in payments and 25 million transactions across over 33 African countries where it currently operates.\n\nIn 2017 Flutterwave was named Africa\u2019s best fintech company at the Apps Africa Innovation Awards. Their latest funding, $170 million was raised in March, 2021 from a Series C round which saw the company attain a Unicorn status.\n\nIn November and December of the same year, Flutterwave acquired Disha, and, speaking of investment, the company invested in CINETPAY in a seed round valued at $2.4 million.\n\nOther than payments solutions, several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants, Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK, and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows medium and small medium enterprises use their phones as point-on-sale (POS) machines have been launched.\n\nTo round off the year 2021, the company launched its latest product, Send to take payment services to the global level and this will be achieved by its collaboration with popular Nigerian artist Wizkid. With his fanbase, Wizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service.\n\nMono (fintech)\n\nMono is an application programming interface (API) startup that allows companies to access data from their customers bank accounts as well as debit money from these same bank accounts.\n\nThe one-year-old startup co-founded by Abdul Hassan, a former product manager at Paystack, and Prakhar Singh has raised $17.65 million in total funding to date.\n\nThe company\u2019s mission is to go beyond banking, by making it possible to access financial accounts for data from multiple financial and non-financial sources. This can help digital businesses build innovative and more inclusive financial services.\n\nExactly a year after inception, it raised a $15 million Series A funding round and its API technology acts as a testament to its capabilities. Mono has signed on customers that cut across health and lending. Some of them include Carbon, OnePipe, Swipe, Anyi Health, Flutterwave, and a variety of developers.\n\nWallets (fintech)\n\nWallets A is a borderless digital bank for Africa that provides a seamless experience to users and builds on new payments infrastructure. The platform enables people \u2013 Africans and foreigners \u2013 to spend locally across the continent without having to create an account with a local bank.\n\nAfter it started operations in 2019 with John Oke as founder, it participated in the W19 funding batch. The startup prides itself as a Y Combinator alumni which contributes greatly to the company\u2019s progress according to the company.\n\nIt was recognised as the best electronic payment website in Nigeria in 2019 by Nigeria internet Registration Association (NiRA), as well as one of 100 leading global innovators in financial services by KPMG, and the top 100 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria in 2020 by Business Day.\n\nKobo360 (logistics)\n\nKobo is a technology company providing SMEs with solutions to challenges faced with their ability to scale. These solutions drive efficiency and growth in the logistics space by connecting asset owners in the industry with the SMEs that need their services.\n\nFollowing its participation in the S18 funding batch, Kobo is preparing to enter the agro-trading space by developing a marketplace that connects farmers with buyers all over the world. The marketplace will eliminate the high cost of middlemen for smallholder farmers and increase their profits.\n\nThe company was co-founded by Ife Oyedele and Obi Ozor in 2016 and claims it has over 10,000 drivers and trucks operating on its app, as well as clients including Honeywell, Olam, Unilever, Dangote, among others.\n\nVendease (agritech)\n\nVendease is a marketplace that lets restaurants in Africa, order directly from farms and food manufacturers.\n\nInstead of going through expensive middlemen, vendors, or sending staff to open markets with hiked prices, restaurants can now get on their platform, click to order and get all their food supplies within 24hrs.\n\nSince its inception in January 2020 by four friends- Tunde Kara, Olumide Fayankin, Gatumi Aliyu and Wale Oyepeju, the startup is solving Africa\u2019s food supply chain problems by digitising procurement processes, storage operations and logistics, and offering flexible payment systems to help food businesses grow.\n\nThe most recent Y Combinator\u2019s funding- W21 featured Vendease and in December 2021, the company announced its intention of being the Amazon for Nigeria\u2019s food vendors with the seed round of $3.2 million raised in October 2021.\n\nIts technology doesn\u2019t just allow food businesses to place orders for food supplies, it also tracks them, as well as manage inventory, track expenses and gain access to credit facilities.\n\nReleaf (agritech)\n\nReleaf develops novel industrial processing technology for African crops. This is a pre-processing technology that allows farmers to improve the quality and scale of raw materials provided to African food factories.\n\nThe company targets domestic demand in industries where it can develop pre-processing technology to increase the amount of addressable, quality raw material that can be sourced directly from farmers.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Uzoma Ayogu and Ikenna Nzewi, the startup palm nut processing technology has gained popularity with novel financing capabilities to revolutionize the continent\u2019s decentralized food production sector.\n\nIt recently secured a $4.2 million seed round in September 2021 to solve the distance and logistics problems between farmers and consumers making its total funding amount at $5.7 million.",

          "title": "Concerns over increasing aircraft amid limited parking spaces at airports",
          "text": "Industry operators have raised concerns over inadequate parking spaces across Nigerian airports amid plans by existing airlines to acquire new aircraft just as new airlines are set to commence operations in 2022.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that major airports operated by domestic carriers such as Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Enugu airports already have limited parking spaces or slots for airlines operating scheduled flights into these terminals and there may be challenges accommodating more aircraft without proper planning.\n\nIn a bid to avoid the crisis that could surround this challenge, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is mulling the allocation of slots.\n\nThis means that each airline would be allocated a slot for take-off and any operator failing to depart within the allotted time would be surcharged.\n\n\u201cThere would be parking problems for the new aircraft and that is why we must revert to the arrangement of the 90s where operational bases are designated to each airline instead of concentrating in Lagos and planning movements for their first flights to originate from Lagos at first light,\u201d John Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary-general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI) told BusinessDay.\n\nRead Also: To attract aviation investment in 2022, insecurity must be addressed \u2013 Olowo\n\nOjikutu, who also suggested slot allocation for airlines as a way to ensure safety, reduce congestion and flight delays at the airport, said any airline that fails to operate within its allocated slot must be surcharged.\n\nHe said this will reduce unnecessary delays attributed as \u2018due to technical reasons or operational reasons\u2019 that cannot be proven to the passengers but which now have been attributed to the capacity of the terminals or capability of the terminal allied services.\n\n\u201cThere has been an increase in the number of airlines and aircraft but the surge in the passengers may likely not go beyond the numbers recorded at Christmas season. However, FAAN should keep a programme for slots allocation handy should the situation continue or for future occasions,\u201d Ojikutu said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s aviation industry is expected to experience a flurry of activities in 2022, with new airlines coming up, and 22 prospective operators in the process of marking their presence in the skies.\n\nAir Peace is expected to receive more Embraer aircraft in 2022. Ibom Air, the indigenous airline of the Akwa Ibom State Government, which has placed an order for 10 A220 aircraft with Airbus, is expected to receive some of the aircraft in 2022.\n\nOverland Airways, a scheduled and charter operator in Nigeria which ordered six brand new Embraer E175s aircraft is also expected to acquire some this year.\n\nNG Eagle has its Air Operating Certificate ready and has three aircraft on ground waiting to commence operation.\n\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that the orders made by airlines last year is good news for the industry. However, there are concerns about the capacity of the airports to contain these aircraft and passenger surge if the economy gets better.\n\nOhunayo suggested that airlines and airport authorities have to work together and start to look at the slot system for the busy airports only.\n\nHe said the slot system will also bring some discipline to airlines when they understand the cost of losing a slot at a space-constrained airport.\n\nHe also advised airlines to consider making less busy airports their hub and operational base to decongest traffic at busy airports.\n\n\u201cIf airlines can afford to do night stops outside Lagos, it will reduce bottlenecks being experienced in Lagos. FAAN needs to extend the operational hours of these airports to reduce the bottlenecks in the major airports. Once you extend the working hours, more flights will run into the night, and if more flights run into the night, airlines can begin to look at having night stops.\n\n\u201cInstead of flights departing early in the morning from Lagos, they can depart from other cities into Lagos and continue from there.

          "title": "Blue chip vs red chip art",
          "text": "What are they, and how do they stack up to each other?\n\nThis digest is brought to you by Patrons MCAA. Patrons is a full-suite art advisory firm that helps private and corporate art collectors with diversifying their wealth through art collection, appraisal, packaging & transportation, storage, insurance, maintenance and restoration.\n\nSeasoned art collectors are very familiar with the terms \u201cblue chip art\u201d and albeit newly coined, \u201cred chip art\u201d. If you are not a seasoned collector, you may wonder what these two terms mean.\n\nBlue chip art. Where did this term come from? What does it mean? Why blue?\n\nIn business, any company referred to as \u201cblue chip\u201d depicts that they are most likely the largest and oldest and are industry leaders whose values are universally accepted.\n\nIn art, blue chip art is created by the world\u2019s most renowned artists whose works and position in the art market have been reinforced by many years of extraordinary sales volume. Artists who fall into this category are often household names. Think, Grillo, Ben Enwonwu, El Anatsui, and the likes. They have a track record of achieving high, if not record-breaking, auction sales. They also have incredible gallery and institutional support in a way that ensures their market value is consistently soaring. This support system anchors them in such a way that it is impossible for them to fail in market performance.\n\nBlue chip art is reliably going to increase in value no matter what, and you can place your bet on this type of art. If you\u2019re looking for consistent high value art investment, blue chip art is your best option.\n\nRed chip art is quite the opposite. Red chip artists do not enjoy the type of support and recognition blue chip artists get. Red chip artists are typically new to the art market. Red chip artists have garnered a lot of respect, following, and success through social media so much so that their works skip the traditional process and have now reached the auctions, selling for staggering prices. Their performance in the markets are in a way that is not predictable and in no way, traditional. They lack a strong primary market because they skipped that process and are now selling at 200 \u2013 500% of the lower range of their lot in auctions.\n\nBeing a red chip artist is not a question of one\u2019s ability or talent, but rather it shows that they are still on their journey to possibly attain a blue chip status.\n\nWe live in an interesting time where wealth creation and distribution are being disrupted like never before. A lot of new money is getting into art and they are not the typical and seasoned collector. However, they are in possession of disposable cash to buy any kind of art because it is possibly a new interest they have taken on. A lot of times, the collectors of red chip art are new money and in the art world they are what we have coined to be \u201c the flippers\u201d. The flippers buy art with the intention to flip it at an auction or private art sale within a set time frame for exceptional returns. Whilst this is great and in this new age, attainable, the danger herein lies with the person who has now purchased a red chip art at an outrageous figure. (S)he is now in possession of a piece of artwork by a red chip artist that does not have a stable primary market. This new collector would have to devise ways to protect the artist, the art, and the value at which this art piece was purchased.\n\nIf you have purchased a red chip art, the only way for you to ensure it has staying value and power is to put it to work. Get it to be talked about in art literature and/or if you can, donate it to an art institution. This creates and builds conversation and credibility around it. In simple terms, put the piece to work. Make sure it has primary access especially because it skipped the primary market to get into the secondary market.\n\nIn a later newsletter, we will delve more into the different art markets and their individual relevance, their significance to each other, and how to navigate them.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nArt Index Top 5\n\nWelcome to 2022! From the jury and I, we hope you had a splendid holiday season. What are your art investment goals for this new year? This inaugural article for 2022 brings yet another exquisite selection for Art Index\u2019s top 5. Art Index Africa\u2019s jury presents a showdown of the top 5 well researched and curated art pieces every collector should want to purchase based on strong technique, message, style, and medium.\n\nHere are our picks for this week\u2019s article:\n\nArtist: Oladotun Abiola \u2022 Titled: Antiques \u2022 Medium: Mixed Media on Canvas \u2022 Size: 5ft x 5ft\u201d \u2022 Year: 2021 \u2022 Estimate: $1,325\n\nSynopsis\n\nAntiques is a painting sampling the artist\u2019s perception of some of the African masquerade pantheons and spirits.\n\nThere\u2019s a deliberate stylising of the forms to give them a contemporary feel without compromising the ancient essence deducible in their faces.\n\nArtist: Oladele Ogbeyemi \u2022 Titled: The Return of the Ape \u2022 Medium: Mixed Media \u2022 Size: 84\u201d x 63\u201d \u2022 Year: 2021 \u2022 Estimate: $13,921\n\nSynopsis\n\n\u201cThis piece was inspired by the movie, The Return of Ape. It inspired me and also supported my ideology of animals in the future. We have seen apes display human war formation and tactics in their defence system, which also has a huge connection to the title of this series, Arunko Seynihun (Animal in humans\u2019 character).\n\nApes have improved in the ability to exhibit humans\u2019 skills and features in their daily routine, and I believe that if they are scientifically taught how to use guns, they will comprehend and start using guns to defend themselves and their territory.\u201d\n\nArtist: Anthonia Nnenna Ndukauba \u2022 Titled: Friday Night \u2022 Medium: Mixed Media \u2022 Size: 18\u201d x 22\u201d \u2022 Year: 2021 \u2022 Estimate: $1,000\n\nSynopsis\n\n\u201cA little wine on a Friday night is good for the soul. This piece was created after two months of artist block. I was quite overwhelmed and decided to visit the beach with some of my close acquaintances. Upon my return, I felt free. I felt the urge to document my experience at the beach but I couldn\u2019t find the words to pen down anything.\n\nRead also: Scholastic art creations releases new film\n\nSo as an artist would, I got some colors and started to paint on my alabaster paper, also infusing my one-line drawing on the colors. That was when it occurred to me that the art I just created was the scenery of the beach; the dark shades, the glass of wine, the hat, and the bare body. If you would observe closely, you can see that the colors are earthy colors, which represents the common colors that define beaches. This piece broke down my block and that paved the way for more creativity after 2 months of hiatus.\u201d\n\nArtist: Udegbe \u2022 Titled: JAGUNMOLU Warrior Horse \u2022 Medium: Bronze \u2022 Size: 3ft \u2022 Year: 2019 \u2022 Estimate: $1,180\n\nSynopsis\n\n\u201cJAGUNMOLU, is a warrior horse. The statues showcase the strength of horses in the period of War and the risks they pass through to defend and support their masters. The African slave trade was closely tied to the imports of war horses. However, as the slave trade decreased and was eventually abolished, the need for horses for raiding and defending villages were decreased until they became obsolete.\u201d\n\nArtist: Emeka Nwagbara \u2022 Titled: Elegance \u2013 series 1 \u2022 Medium: Acrylic on Canvas \u2022 Size: 20\u201d x 30\u201d \u2022 Year: 2021 \u2022 Estimate: $750\n\nSynopsis\n\n\u201cElegance, is a painting inspired by one of my longest running series \u201cgele \u2018 \u2013 a painting of women getting dressed for an occasion, adorned in elaborate head gears that complimented their dresses. With elegance, I needed to depict the beauty and elegance of femininity in abstraction using just shapes, lines, and colours.\n\nThis is the first in a series that promises to run for a while.\u201d\n\nUntil August,",

My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality. The term \u201ccritique\u201d is used in the cover of the work to show no malice is intended in writing it. After all, all mortals on earth and institutions have their high and low points. Only God is perfect, does not err and is omniscient.\n\n5.OBASEKI: THREE YEARS ON THE SADDLE (NOVEMBER 12, 2016- NOVEMBER 11, 2019)\n\nIt contains the activities of Obaseki in the three years of his first tenure in office as Governor of Edo State. Obaseki relied on his performance during this period as a launch pad for his re-election September 19, 2020.\n\n6.FIRST TENURE: CONSOLIDATED DIARY OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nThis is a compendium of all the plans, programmes and projects either executed or proposed by the administration of Obaseki during the four years of his first, concluded tenure as Governor on November 11, 2020.\n\n7.MILESTONES OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a body of work which highlights the official accomplishments of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies under Obaseki during the first year of his second tenure in office as Governor.\n\n8.SECOND TENURE: FIRST \u2013 YEAR HARVEST OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a detailed summary of the activities of Obaseki Government that is self-sufficient in facts and information arranged in chronological sequence of occurrence. When you read through this work, you are educated about all that the administration did in the first year of its second tenure.\n\n9.Proposed Plans, Programmes And Projects Of Obaseki Administration (2021 Edition)\n\nThe work lists 68 items on the shelf of Obaseki government that are ongoing or awaiting execution as at the last quarter of 2021.\n\nLast Work: All these works are apolitical. Therefore, they are not sponsored by any individual, group or political party. Rather, the works were put together by a team of researchers who believe passionately in providing resources material with which Edo citizens and other interested persons can get relevant facts about Edo State Government.\n\nMICHAEL A.

          "title": "Equity bulls deflated by hawkish Fed",
          "text": "Lukman Otunuga\n\nStock markets are limping into Thursday\u2019s session in a frightened state after the minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting pointed to a faster than expected hike in interest rates.\n\nAsian stocks flashed red this morning following the heavy selloff on Wall Street overnight as hawkish signals from the FOMC minutes and spread of the Omicron variant sapped investor confidence. Gold has also found itself under pressure with prices struggling to keep above the psychological $1800 support level. In the FX space, the dollar appreciated as US Treasury yields jumped after the meeting minutes were released.\n\nGiven the market reaction to a more hawkish Fed, global equities certainly remain highly sensitive to increased rate hike expectations. With the US December jobs report around the corner, the atmosphere across the board could become tense and nervy as investors adopt a cautious stance. Whatever the outcome on Friday, the first trading week of 2022 has already kicked off with a bang.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the US non-farm payrolls\n\nAll eyes are now firmly focused on December\u2019s US jobs report which will be released on Friday. The pending data will be heavily scrutinised by investors for key insight into the health of the US labour market and wage growth.\n\nYesterday, the ADP Employment Report revealed that private sector employment surged by 807,000 in December. This figure smashed market forecasts and was a big jump from the 505,000 witnessed in November. Even though the ADP data is a poor predictor of the key non-farm payrolls report on Friday, markets may be readying themselves for a potential upbeat number. Consensus expects 425,000 jobs to have been created by the US economy last month, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.1% from 4.2%.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the US jobs report is being released at a time when the Fed has signaled interest rate hikes may be more aggressive than expected, amid concerns over soaring inflation. The March Fed meeting is now very much \u201clive\u201d with an 80% chance of an interest rate hike. The general consensus at the Fed also appears to be emerging that the maximum employment goal is now within reach, so NFP may play a big part in validating this thinking.\n\nShould the jobs report exceed market expectations, this is likely to boost confidence in the US economy and reinforce expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates in the Spring. Such a development may result in a stronger dollar while pressuring equity bulls and gold further. Alternatively, a massive payroll miss similar to November may raise questions over the health of the US economy and the Fed\u2019s ability to aggressively raise rates.\n\nCommodity spotlight \u2013 Gold\n\nA stronger dollar, hawkish Federal Reserve, and rising treasury yields make a poisonous cocktail for gold. The precious metal is under pressure on the daily charts with prices struggling to keep above $1800 as of writing.\n\nWhere the precious metal closes the week is likely to be heavily influenced by the key US jobs data on Friday. A strong report could cripple gold bugs, opening a path lower towards $1786 and $1770. Should $1800 prove to be reliable support, prices may rebound back towards the $1810 and $1831.\n\nLukman Otunuga is a Senior Research Analyst at FXTM\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Plateau State governor, Simon Lalong, has disclosed that the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) will give a date for the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention after its meeting on Sunday.\n\nHe disclosed this to State House correspondents on Friday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nRecall that President Buhari in an interview with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) aired on Thursday night, urged APC leaders to put their house in order so that the ruling party can retain power in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nHe warned against the persistent differences, disunity, and lack of agreement, which could put the platform in jeopardy during the elections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe caretaker chairman of the APC, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State also met with the President on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Lalong said the governors were working assiduously to hold the party\u2019s convention next month.\n\nHe further stated that President Buhari was still insisting that there must be an immediate convention.\n\nHe said, \u201cYes, I agree that all the times there are meetings, especially taking final decisions on the party, I\u2019m always part of it and part of it was also why I visited the President and the President still stands committed that there must be an immediate convention.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou know, when a convention is coming there are fears here and there, some people will tell you it will work, it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to a conclusion, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday.\n\n\u201cBy Sunday we will tell you when we\u2019re doing the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think our first date before Christmas we said we\u2019re going to do a convention in February and we are still working for convention, as far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThese are things that the President was raising his fears, but we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election. Some parties have done their own, the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from doing their own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, is also telling the governor\u2019s please do more, and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to put our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss, but I\u2019m not drawing conclusion, but I always tell you that a political party is a cumulation of interests, the interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.\n\n\u201cBut I just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonize all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from this present government,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "Plateau State governor, Simon Lalong, has disclosed that the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) will give a date for the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention after its meeting on Sunday.\nADVERTISEMENTThe caretaker chairman of the APC, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State also met with the President on Thursday.\nHowever, Lalong said the governors were working assiduously to hold the party\u2019s convention next month.\nI think our first date before Christmas we said we\u2019re going to do a convention in February and we are still working for convention, as far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.",

          "text": "Sidney Poitier, whose elegant bearing and principled onscreen characters made him Hollywood\u2019s first Black movie star and the first Black man to win the best actor Oscar, has died. He was 94.\n\nClint Watson, press secretary for the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, confirmed to CNN that Poitier died Thursday evening.\n\nPoitier overcame an impoverished background in the Bahamas and softened his thick island accent to rise to the top of his profession at a time when prominent roles for Black actors were rare. He won the Oscar for 1963\u2019s \u201cLilies of the Field,\u201d in which he played an itinerant laborer who helps a group of White nuns build a chapel.\n\nMany of his best-known films explored racial tensions as Americans were grappling with social changes wrought by the civil rights movement. In 1967 alone, he appeared as a Philadelphia detective fighting bigotry in small-town Mississippi in \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d and a doctor who wins over his White fianc\u00e9e\u2019s skeptical parents in \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner.\u201d\n\nPoitier\u2019s movies struggled for distribution in the South, and his choice of roles was limited to what White-run studios would produce. Racial taboos, for example, precluded him from most romantic parts. But his dignified roles helped audiences of the 1950s and 1960s envision Black people not just as servants but as doctors, teachers and detectives.\n\nAt the same time, as the lone Black leading man in 1960s Hollywood, he came under tremendous scrutiny. He was too often hailed as a noble symbol of his race and endured criticism from some Black people who said he had betrayed them by taking sanitized roles and pandering to Whites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an enormous responsibility,\u201d Poitier told Oprah Winfrey in 2000. \u201cAnd I accepted it, and I lived in a way that showed how I respected that responsibility. I had to. In order for others to come behind me, there were certain things I had to do.\u201d\n\nAs a young actor he overcame enormous challenges\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Sidney Poitier was born several months premature in Miami on February 20, 1927, so tiny he could fit in his father\u2019s hand. His parents were tomato farmers who often traveled to and from Florida and the Bahamas.\n\nHe was not expected to live. His mother consulted a palm reader, who assuaged her fears.\n\n\u201cThe lady took her hand and started speaking to my mother: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about your son. He will survive,\u2019 \u201d Poitier told CBS News in 2013. \u201cAnd these were her words; she said, \u2018He will walk with kings.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSidney Poitier as a teacher who must win over his students in a still from the 1967 film \u201cTo Sir, with Love.\u201d\n\nWhen he was 15, Poitier\u2019s parents sent him from the Bahamas to live with an older brother in Miami, where they figured he would have better opportunities. His father took him to the dock and put $3 in his hand.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018take care of yourself, son.\u2019 And he turned me around to face the boat,\u201d Poitier told NPR in 2009.\n\nPoitier didn\u2019t like Miami and soon headed north to New York, where he tried his hand at acting. It did not go well at first. With limited schooling, he had trouble reading a script.\n\nBut he got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, where a fortuitous encounter changed his life. An elderly waiter took an interest in the teen and spent nights after work reading the newspaper with him to improve his comprehension, grammar and punctuation.\n\n\u201cThat man, every night, the place is closed, everyone\u2019s gone, and he sat there with me week after week after week,\u201d Poitier told CBS News. \u201cAnd he told me about punctuations. He told me where dots were and what the dots mean here between these two words, all of that stuff.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Poitier landed work with the American Negro Theatre, where he took acting lessons, softened his Bahamian accent and landed a stage role as an understudy to Harry Belafonte. This led to roles on Broadway and eventually caught the attention of Hollywood.\n\nActor Sidney Poitier, left, with actor Tony Franciosa, talk show host David Susskind, singer Harry Belafonte and actress Shelley Winters on the talk show \u201cOpen End\u201d in 1960 in New York City.\n\nHe refused to take roles he felt were demeaning\n\nPoitier\u2019s first movie was 1950\u2019s \u201cNo Way Out,\u201d a noir film in which he played a young doctor who must treat a racist patient. That led to increasingly prominent roles as a reverend in the apartheid drama \u201cCry, the Beloved Country,\u201d a troubled student in \u201cBlackboard Jungle\u201d and an escaped prisoner in \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d in which he and Tony Curtis were shackled together and forced to get along to survive. With that 1958 film, Poitier became the first Black man to be nominated for an Oscar.\n\nBut for a dark-skinned actor in the 1950s, finding complex roles was difficult.\n\n\u201c(Blacks) were so new in Hollywood. There was almost no frame of reference for us except as stereotypical, one-dimensional characters,\u201d Poitier told Winfrey. \u201cI had in mind what was expected of me \u2014 not just what other Blacks expected but what my mother and father expected. And what I expected of myself.\u201d\n\nSidney Poitier with Lilia Skala in 1963\u2019s \u201cLilies of the Field.\u201d The role earned him an Oscar.\n\nEarly on, Poitier made a conscious decision to reject roles that weren\u2019t consistent with his values or that reflected badly upon his race. He told Winfrey that as a struggling young actor, he turned down a role that paid $750 a week because he didn\u2019t like the character, a janitor who didn\u2019t respond after thugs killed his daughter and threw her body on his lawn.\n\n\u201cI could not imagine playing that part. So I said to myself, \u2018That\u2019s not the kind of work I want.\u2019 And I told my agent that I couldn\u2019t play the role,\u201d Poitier said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why can\u2019t you play it? There\u2019s nothing derogatory about it in racial terms,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 He never understood.\u201d\n\nStill, by the late 1950s, Poitier was landing regular acting work. He appeared in the first Broadway production of \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d in 1959 and starred in the movie version two years later. Then came \u201cLilies of the Field,\u201d biblical epic \u201cThe Greatest Story Ever Told\u201d and the drama \u201cA Patch of Blue,\u201d in which his character had a chaste romance with a blind white woman.\n\nSpurred by his friendship with the more outspoken Belafonte, Poitier also began embracing the civil rights movement.

          "text": "Sidney Poitier, whose elegant bearing and principled onscreen characters made him Hollywood\u2019s first Black movie star and the first Black man to win the best actor Oscar, has died. He was 94.\n\nClint Watson, press secretary for the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, confirmed to CNN that Poitier died Thursday evening.\n\nPoitier overcame an impoverished background in the Bahamas and softened his thick island accent to rise to the top of his profession at a time when prominent roles for Black actors were rare. He won the Oscar for 1963\u2019s \u201cLilies of the Field,\u201d in which he played an itinerant laborer who helps a group of White nuns build a chapel.\n\nMany of his best-known films explored racial tensions as Americans were grappling with social changes wrought by the civil rights movement. In 1967 alone, he appeared as a Philadelphia detective fighting bigotry in small-town Mississippi in \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d and a doctor who wins over his White fianc\u00e9e\u2019s skeptical parents in \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner.\u201d\n\nPoitier\u2019s movies struggled for distribution in the South, and his choice of roles was limited to what White-run studios would produce. Racial taboos, for example, precluded him from most romantic parts. But his dignified roles helped audiences of the 1950s and 1960s envision Black people not just as servants but as doctors, teachers and detectives.\n\nAt the same time, as the lone Black leading man in 1960s Hollywood, he came under tremendous scrutiny. He was too often hailed as a noble symbol of his race and endured criticism from some Black people who said he had betrayed them by taking sanitized roles and pandering to Whites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an enormous responsibility,\u201d Poitier told Oprah Winfrey in 2000. \u201cAnd I accepted it, and I lived in a way that showed how I respected that responsibility. I had to. In order for others to come behind me, there were certain things I had to do.\u201d\n\nAs a young actor he overcame enormous challenges\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Sidney Poitier was born several months premature in Miami on February 20, 1927, so tiny he could fit in his father\u2019s hand. His parents were tomato farmers who often traveled to and from Florida and the Bahamas.\n\nHe was not expected to live. His mother consulted a palm reader, who assuaged her fears.\n\n\u201cThe lady took her hand and started speaking to my mother: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about your son. He will survive,\u2019 \u201d Poitier told CBS News in 2013. \u201cAnd these were her words; she said, \u2018He will walk with kings.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSidney Poitier as a teacher who must win over his students in a still from the 1967 film \u201cTo Sir, with Love.\u201d\n\nWhen he was 15, Poitier\u2019s parents sent him from the Bahamas to live with an older brother in Miami, where they figured he would have better opportunities.

          "text": "Former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has said a political solution is still being pursued concerning the case of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. The IPOB leader, who is facing charges bordering on terrorism and treason, is currently in the custody of the Department of State Services.\n\nSome Igbo leaders had last year visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the State House in Abuja to seek Kanu\u2019s release. This is amidst calls for a political solution to Kanu\u2019s case. During the visit, Buhari told them that an unconditional release of the IPOB leader runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary.\n\nThis is as he stated in a recent interview with Channels Television that Kanu should defend himself in court for peddling false information about his regime while he was overseas.\n\nReacting, Ekweremadu, in an interview with Dream FM, Enugu, said he doesn\u2019t think Buhari ruled out a political solution to Kanu\u2019s case.\n\nThe Senator said, \u201cPolitical solution in the Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s matter is still very feasible. I also watched the Channels Television interview and I don\u2019t think Mr. President ruled out a political solution. In fact, I would have been surprised if he said he would just release Nnamdi Kanu because there is the independence of every arm of government, including the judiciary. There are procedures.\n\n\u201cI recall that it was exactly Mr. President\u2019s response when I led a delegation of the South-East Caucus of the Senate to see him on the Nnamdi Kanu issue in November 2016. But ultimately we kept reaching out and dialoguing until we had a political solution, which resulted in the judiciary granting Mazi Nnamdi Kanu bail because ultimately, everything will come to the judiciary because every arm of government is independent.\n\n\u201cSo, we will keep working on a political solution, nevertheless. We will keep engaging the government, just as we will continue to appeal to our youth and people to ensure the stability and prosperity of our region.\u201d\n\nHe said feedback is being expected from the government concerning the political solution being pursued.\n\n\u201cIn line with the political solution, which the southeast Caucus of the National Assembly is quitely pursuing, I led a delegation of some Igbo leaders like the Deputy Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Secretary-General, Amb. Okey Emuchay; and Bishop of the Methodist Church of Nigeria and Co-Chair Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace, Bishop Sunday Onuoha.\n\n\u201cAs usual, I deliberately didn\u2019t want to make it public because it is a quiet service we are rendering to Ndigbo and the nation. But the DSS eventually made it public in one of their statements. So, to answer your question, yes, I did lead a delegation to interface with the Kanu and the authorities. We had useful conversations. We have equally made some requests and we are waiting for feedback from the government to make progress,\u201d he said.",

He was not in the hostel over the weekend.\n\n\u201cSylvester did not leave with any visible body injuries from the school contrary to what was showcased on social media,\u201d it said, insisting that no issue was raised about his health until seven days after he was collected from school; a follow-up call to the family, while he was at home, revealed his leg was being massaged, nothing else.\u201d\n\nStating that Dowen College had been dragged through the mud, the management said \u201ctoday the truth wins, our faith wins and our integrity wins.\u201d\n\nThe management stressed that \u201cthe autopsy report which is the product of the work of seven of the leading Pathologists in Nigeria, including one representing the Oromoni family from Delta State has shown that Sylvester had several chronic pre-existing health conditions. These health conditions cannot be fabricated or doctored. If there were contributory injuries from any bodily harm they would have been presented and stated.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, persons believed to be members of the Ijaw Youth Council on Thursday stormed the premises of Dowen College to protest the recent release of suspects detained over the death of young Oromoni.\n\nEarlier, a video of final moments of late Oromoni also obtained by Peoples Gazette indicated that he died of no natural causes, as it indicated that he was badly beaten to which the doctor attested to internal injuries.",

          "text": "\u2026Lassa fever killed 92 Nigerians in 2021- Report \u2026Prepare for fresh, deadlier outbreaks, NMA warns \u2026No coordinated effort to reduce casualties \u2013 Expert \u2026Nigeria currently experiencing fourth wave \u2013 NCDC\n\nNigeria is currently witnessing a resurgence of Lassa fever amidst the fourth wave of Covid-19 pandemic occasioned by the Omicron variants. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the current outbreak.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recently disclosed that 16 states have recorded at least one confirmed case of Lassa fever across 66 local government areas in the country. This was disclosed in the agency\u2019s latest Lassa fever situation report for week 49 spanning from December 6-20.\n\nThe report also indicated that Lassa fever has killed 92 people in the country in 2021.The confirmed figures resulting from Lassa fever were recorded in Ondo -45, Edo -14, Taraba -12, Kaduna -4, Bauchi -3, Ebonyi -2, Nasarawa -2, and Enugu -1.\n\nNCDC also noted that eight health workers have been infected with the viral disease. It added that the number of new confirmed cases increased from 4 in week 48, 2021 to 10 cases -These were reported from Ondo, Edo, and Nasarawa states.\n\n\u201cCumulatively from week 1 to week 49, 2021, 92 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 18.7 per cent which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (20.7 per cent). In total for 2021, 16 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 64 local government areas.\n\n\u201cOf all confirmed cases, 84 per cent are from Edo (44 per cent), Ondo (35 per cent) and Taraba (five per cent) states,\u201d the Centre stated.\n\nSimilarly, two senior consultant gynecologists have reportedly died of Lassa fever at the Dalhatu Arafat Specialist Hospital (DASH) in Lafia, Nasarawa state.\n\nBlueprint weekend learnt that they contracted the disease during an emergency caesarian operation conducted on a woman, who was bleeding and admitted at the hospital, but unknown to the doctors that she had Lassa fever.\n\nA source at the hospital confirmed that the pregnant woman was rushed to the hospital over complications arising from Lassa fever, but the consultants, who attended to her, thought it was pregnancy-related complications. The woman and the baby died some hours after the surgery.\n\nIt was further learnt that the test result showed that she had Lassa fever, which actually led to complications that resulted in premature labour that necessitated her being rushed to the hospital on emergency.\n\nThe source also disclosed that one of the doctors, who performed the operation, died last week and that the test result confirmed that he died of Lassa fever, while the second doctor has died.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Mrs. Ruth Namo, confirmed that the two gynecologists died of Lassa fever.\n\nNMA\u2019s warnings\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has advised the country to prepare for possibly fresh and deadlier Lassa fever outbreaks.\n\nIts president, Prof. Innocent Ujah, at the opening of the December National Executive Council (NEC) meeting (Caliphate City 2021) recently in Sokoto, expressed concerns over emerging and re-emerging infections.\n\nHe stressed the need to continually put together effective outbreak prevention and control measures that were culturally appropriate, relevant and feasible for communities to check unnecessary loss of life and minimise disruptions to essential services.\n\nThe obstetrician and gynaecologist canvassed uninterrupted community engagement, social mobilisation and communication for effective prevention and control of these emerging diseases.\n\nUjah said \u201cthis is on the premise that every outbreak is unique and community understanding of diseases and their spread are complex, context-dependent and culturally mediated; hence the need for effective coordination.\u201d\n\nThe NMA boss said Nigeria \u201chas the opportunity of applying the World Health Organisation (WHO) outbreak communication principles geared at preventing exposure, stopping transmission and providing relevant public health information for an overarching goal before, during and after epidemics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will help in building and maintaining public trust in the prevention and control of outbreaks,\u201d he said.\n\nUjah said Nigerian medical doctors and other frontline health workers \u201chave been at risk of contracting these infectious diseases, adding that many had been infected and survived, while some lost their lives in the course of discharging their duties.\u201d\n\nOmicron\n\nSadly, Nigeria is witnessing resurgence in Lassa fever infections amidst the fourth wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Also, the NCDC also announced the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria on December 20, 2021.\n\nIt stated that the country has recorded a 500 per cent increase in the number of confirmed cases within the past two weeks.\n\nThe director-general of the Centre, IfedayoAdefila, in a statement, noted that the rise in infections had been linked to both the Delta and Omicron variants of the rampaging virus.\n\nHowever, the latest statistics by the NCDC showed that Nigeria\u2019s infection toll had increased to 233,353, while the fatality toll stands at 2,991.\n\nAs of Wednesday, December 15, the number of active cases increased from 12,547 to 16,569 cases, while the number of discharged cases now stands at 212,040. The data also shows that Nigeria has so far tested 3,751,696 samples.\n\nCommunity transmission\n\nLikewise, the NCDC confirmed the community transmission of the Covid-19 Omicron variant even as it disclosed that \u201cNigeria has not recorded any death from the variant.\u201d\n\nMaking the disclosure during a webinar on the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, Dr. Adetifa said additional 39 cases of the Omicron variant had been discovered bringing the total to 45. He added that the Omicron had pushed up the number of cases of coronavirus in the country, and that \u201cthe variant is gradually becoming dominant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe six earlier detected Omicron cases were detected in persons with recent travel history to South Africa. It is important for Nigerians to maintain physical distance and avoid contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness.\n\n\u201cWe are counting on you to celebrate responsibly and take responsibility to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from Covid-19.\u201d\n\nLassa fever\n\nA consultant virologist at University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, FunshoIdrisu, in a chat with Blueprint Weekend shed more light on the disease.\n\nHe said, \u201cLassa fever is a severe and often-fatal hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. Since it was originally discovered in 1969 in the village of Lassa in Borno state, there have been countless outbreaks of various magnitude and severity across West Africa.\n\n\u201cThe Lassa virus is a member of the Arenaviridae virus family. Humans contract the virus primarily through contact with the contaminated excreta of Mastomysnatalensis rodents commonly known as the multi-mammate rats, which are the natural reservoirs for the virus.\n\n\u201cThe rodents live in bushes, but because of dry season, they run to houses for protection and live with humans and deposit excreta on floors, tables, beds and foods.\n\n\u201cThe foods that can be contaminated by the rodents include garri, yam, rice and beans, among others. So, people should cover their foods properly, avoid taking soaked garri that was not covered. While feeding on the foods, the rodents defecate and urinate on them, which is not good for human consumption. So, people should not eat leftover foods without properly warming them.\n\n\u201cThe virus is transmitted to humans through cuts and scratches. In some regions, mastomys rodents are consumed as food, but it is better for people to avoid contact with rodents.\n\n\u201cIn the early stages, Lassa fever is often misdiagnosed as influenza, typhoid or malaria, and as a result many patients fail to receive appropriate medical treatment. Making a correct diagnosis of Lassa fever is made difficult by the wide spectrum of clinical effects that manifest, ranging from asymptomatic to multi-organ system failure and death. The onset of the illness is typically indolent, with no specific symptoms to distinguish it from other febrile illnesses.\u201d\n\nWhat we eat\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, a public health consultant, Dr. Uche Okolie, urged Nigerians to be wary of buying snacks wrapped in newspapers or other unhygienic means.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is also important to bring to the attention of Nigerians that we should be wary of smoked meat slices (suya), bean cake (popularly called akara in local parlance), roasted corn and other food items or snacks that are usually sold by wrapping them in old newspapers or other paper materials where rodents might have excreted on them.\n\n\u201cThat paper-wrapped food item may not be washed or rinsed before consumption so it becomes unhealthy to eat. It is therefore not hygienic to keep food items in used papers. These papers may not, by mere visual inspection, reveal rodents\u2019 urine or excreta, so difficulty may arise in discerning which ones are contaminated or not. One never can tell if these papers have come in contact with excreta from rats. When an individual then consumes food items wrapped in these contaminated papers, such a one may be at high risk of contracting Lassa fever. It is, therefore, advisable to play safe by taking your container to receive the food items at the point of sales or requesting them to be sold in a safe and healthy wrapper.\u201d\n\nHe also warned Nigerians against the consumption of cassava flakes (garri) to avoid contracting Lassa fever. He said the rats that caused the disease were mostly in contact with the most popular Nigerian staple food, garri.\n\n\u201cWhen garri is soaked in ordinary water and consumed, one is exposed to the risk of contracting Lassa fever. But if the water is boiled to make eba, it could go a long way to kill the bacteria caused by pests or rodents in garri.\u201d\n\nAn expert\u2019s view\n\nAlso, a virologist, Dr. Chris Osakwe, of Doctors without Borders in an interview with Blueprint Weekend queried Nigeria\u2019s poor handling of the disease over the years.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe rash of deaths recorded across the country in the wake of the ongoing Lassa fever outbreak is evidence that not much has changed over the years in the management and control of the disease in Nigeria. If any lessons have been learnt at all from previous experiences, they are obviously not being put to proper use to contain the high incidence of the deadly disease. Instead of witnessing a decline in yearly infection rates, Lassa fever cases appear to have become more widespread in the country.\n\n\u201cMore cases are still being recorded on a daily basis. For a disease that is not so strange to the country\u2019s health authorities, there should be better ways of handling it to reasonably bring down the casualty figures. In particular, health care workers, as professionals, should take their self-protection more seriously to reduce the soaring number of casualties among them.\n\n\u201cDespite the annual harvest of deaths, there has not been a well-coordinated, determined and focused effort to reduce the casualty rate and, possibly, eradicate the disease. For a disease that is both curable, if early medical intervention is sought, and preventable through observance of adequate personal hygiene, this is not good enough. Indeed, the figures are alarming and it is getting to a stage where the government can ill afford to continue to ignore them.\u201d\n\nPreventive measures\n\nOn how not to contract the disease, an environmental health scientist Mustapha Haruna, said hygiene is critical in the prevention of the disease.\n\n\u201cThere are many things Nigeria can do to halt the spread of the deadly Lassa fever. The fever has caused devastation in the lives of Nigerians for 51 years, with the virus not prompting changes in the way and manner Africa\u2019s largest economy responds to outbreaks and other health emergencies. Many years down the line, the virus has continued to stage a comeback, with outbreaks already reported in different states of the country.\n\n\u201cIn prevention of Lassa fever, it is critical to maintain a high level of hygiene around the home, which could help to keep rats at bay.\n\n\u201cApart from keeping the home clean, it is also important for the environment to be kept clean and refuse dumpsites to be far away from residences. This falls under the purview of the local government which, in the past, had sanitary inspectors that moved from house-to-house to enforce compliance with accepted standards of cleanliness. Those whose duty it is to clean the drains should be made to do their job to reduce the breeding ground for rodents,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth workers\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Osakwe advised health care practitioners to always observe safety precautions whenever attending to patients. He also advised the general public to store food items, especially grains, garri and powdered food in air-tight containers.\n\n\u201cThe general public should endeavour to quickly report any case of high grade fever not responding to anti-malarial treatment to the nearest hospital, so that quick diagnosis and treatment can be instituted. Early presentation has a good prognosis,\u201d he said.\n\nHe appealed to relevant governments and stakeholders to be serious with the welfare of health personnel. He noted that health personnel risk their lives under a very poor remuneration.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine that the hazard allowance for a doctor is just N5, 000, while those who are not exposed to any risk are being paid allowances running into millions of Naira?\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said joining the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by corrupt politicians would not save them against prosecution by anti-graft agencies.\n\nThe president said this in an interview with the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) monitored in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability. We are very serious about people who aspire to lead at whatever level by their performance, by their integrity both professional and personal.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that we have to work within the system. Even if you suspect individuals, unless there is evidence, there isn\u2019t much we can do. So, really, it is the system that makes it possible for some people really to even be corrupt.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the defectors would not be allowed to go scot-free, the president said: \u201cThey can\u2019t. Nobody can go scot-free as far as I\u2019m concerned. Imagine what the opposition could do to me if there is something along my record, a lot of confusion could have been caused.\n\n\u201cBut luckily I think we try to find officers with integrity and that is the best thing for Nigeria leadership at all levels. Behave with integrity. If that is done, we will achieve better results. If that is not done, a lot of time will be wasted in talking, quarrelling and a lot of noise.\u201d\n\nUrges democracy in APC\n\nOn his party, he said there was need to follow democratic process in selecting the person who would succeed him, stressing that he is not a kingmaker who would determine the next president.\n\nHe said any governor that tries to impose a candidate on the people in the forthcoming elections would face problems.\n\n\u201cMy position is simple, I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then to Abuja. So, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituents, they will know their positions, coming up. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\n\n\u201cThere is no kingmaker from Abuja, no constituency is being dictated to. All constituencies are supposed to produce their leadership in our party. What other parties are doing is their own business, but we want to make sure that our party members understand that they are respected. It is from polling unit, to ward to local government, to state and after Abuja. So those who want to be elected at any level let them work for it. Nobody is going to appoint anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nParty wrangling\n\nCommenting on the forthcoming APC national convention and the internal wrangling within the party, he said there was the need to address all issues to be able to retain power.\n\n\u201cWe have time frame; we have to work because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the party couldn\u2019t agree, then the opposition can take over. What did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together, but when ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realised it, they were off, they are still are still off, they can see it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also said he does not expect Nigerians to appreciate him when he leaves office, saying he has done his best.\n\n\u201cYes, because, look, as you know I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as president. So, I have gone through the system. And really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201cI have given my best and I hope after I leave Nigerians will reflect and at least not show appreciation. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation. But what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. This is the most I\u2019m expecting from Nigerians. But it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m telling you.\n\n\u201cLook at the problem we\u2019re having in the South-east now. How many police stations were taken over, weapons missing? We closed the border with Benin; we closed the border with Niger.\n\n\u201cBut we had to accept the reality that the weapons are coming from our own armouries; police stations have been attacked and so on. So, the main problem is, I hope, I will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also expressed optimism that the insecurity in the country can be resolved before he leaves office, stressing that security forces were working hard on it just as more equipment and ammunition were being procured.\n\n\u201cYes, the government is capable and is going to do it because members of the security, the armed forces and others, they are all security, it depends on one Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo no matter, when people are selfish, is their self first. So, even for their own selves, they better stabilise Nigeria and I believe they will do it.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re short on resources. For example, dealing with the militants, if people bother to reflect on how we found the North-east and South-south and how much progress we have made and acquiring some helicopters, aircraft, their maintenance, their ammunition, armoured cars, you know to counter effectively, the bandits, they cost money and they cost time for training and adaptation,\u201d he said.\n\nLong hours tiring\n\nThe president also admitted that the current long hours he spends working is telling on him because of his age, saying he looks forward to the end of his tenure in 17 months to join his colleagues in retirement.\n\nAsked how he felt clocking 79 recently, the President said: \u201cYes, I think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that you need to see you, can\u2019t see you so that is losing no time.\n\n\u201cAnd about my age, yes, I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I too would have to be less busy.\n\n\u201cThe age is telling on me, working now for 6,7,8 hours a day flight in the office is no joke. Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered, virtually every week, so, really it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain.\u201d",

          "title": "NLC Rejects FG\u2019s Plan To Increase Tax On Carbonated Drinks",
          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) is rejecting plans by the Federal Government to increase taxes on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks.\n\nNLC\u2019s position is contained in a statement signed by its President, Mr Ayuba Wabba, which was circulated to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe government had announced the increased taxes as a way of discouraging over-consumption of sugar, checking obesity, and also generating more money to fund the 2022 budget.\n\nBut the union believes implementing increased taxes on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks, which is one of the provisions in the 2021 Finance Act, will impose more hardship on the citizens.\n\nThe NLC, therefore, asked the National Assembly to urgently amend the sections of the Finance Act which re-introduced excise duties on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks.\n\nRead the full statement below:\n\nOn the 31st of December 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari signed into law the Finance Act. Some of the provisions of the Finance Act includes the imposition of excise duties on locally produced non-alcoholic, carbonated, and sugary drinks.\n\nThe reason offered by government for this decision was to discourage the consumption of sugar by Nigerians as it has led to upsurge in obesity and diabetes. In a letter dated 27th November 2021, the Nigeria Labour Congress wrote to the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR and the leadership of the two chambers of the National Assembly pleading that government should suspend the implementation of the excise duties on non-alcoholic, carbonated and sugary drinks.\n\nThe Congress provided a number of very cogent reasons why government should not go ahead with the decision to impose fresh taxes on soft drinks. One of the reasons we advanced was that the re-introduction of excise duties on non-alcoholic, carbonated and sugary drinks will impose immense hardship on ordinary Nigerians who easily keep hunger at bay with a bottle of soft drink and maybe a loaf of bread.\n\nOur concern is the mass hunger that would result from the slightest increase in the retail price of soft drinks owing to imposition of excise duties as it would be priced beyond the reach of many Nigerians. Congress was also alerted by the complaint of manufacturers of soft drinks in Nigeria that the re-introduction of excise duties would lead to very sharp decline in sales, forced reduction in production capacity, and a certain roll back in investments with the certainty of job losses and possibly shut down of manufacturing plants.\n\nNigerians would recall that this was also the complaint of tyre manufacturing companies such as Dunlop and Michelin which was overlooked by government until the two companies relocated to neighbouring Ghana. A similar situation is playing out with the soft drinks manufacturing sub-sector. Government should pay attention.\n\nWith 38% of the entire manufacturing output in Nigeria and 22.5% share representation of the entire manufacturing sector in Nigeria, the food and beverage industry is the largest industrial sub sector in our country. The food and beverage sub-sector has generated to the coffers of government N202 billion as VAT in the past five years, N7.3 billion as Corporate Social Responsibility and has created 1.5 million decent jobs both directly and indirectly.\n\nThere is thus no gainsaying the fact that the industry is a golden goose that must be kept alive. The health reason proffered by government as reason for the reintroduction of the excise duties seems altruistic. Yet, we are amiss why the government did not place the excise duties on sugar itself as a commodity rather than on carbonated drinks.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that an additional increase in the retail price of carbonated drinks would put more Nigerians at risk of serious health challenges as many people would resort to consuming sub-standard and unhygienic drinks as substitutes for carbonated drinks.\n\nThe appeal to rescind the re-introduction of excise duties on non-alcoholic drinks becomes even more compelling when the projected immediate revenue expected from the policy is weighed against the potential long-term loss to both manufacturers and government. The beverage sub-sector will lose 40% of its current sales revenue.\n\nThis translates to a loss of N1.9 trillion. While the government will only make total projected receipts of N81 billion from the proposed reintroduction of the excise duties. Government also stands to will lose N197 billion in VAT, Company Income Tax and Tertiary Education Tax as a consequence of expected downturn in overall industry performance should the excise duties be effected as being planned.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, we ask the National Assembly to quickly amend the sections of the Finance Act that re-introduced excise duties on non-alcoholic and carbonated drinks. We also ask government to extend COVID-19 palliatives and support incentives to the Food and Beverages industry to cushion the shock and haemorrhage that the industry is trying to recover from.\n\nFinally, we demand that Government should engage Employers in the subsector and Organized Labour in sincere discussions on other options that can deliver a mutually satisfying win-win solution to this issue. We hope that the current situation will not be allowed to degenerate into a breakdown in industrial relations in the sector and generally in the country.\n\nComrade Ayuba Wabba, mni\n\nPresident\n\nJanuary 2022",

          "text": "Police authorities in Lagos State on Friday said the 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lekki, Sylvester Oromoni, died a natural death.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in the state, Hakeem Odumosu, disclosed this while briefing reporters at the Command Headquarters in Ikeja on the investigations conducted into the death of the boy.\n\nHe stated that the final results of the post-mortem and toxicology examination conducted in Lagos and Delta indicated the cause of the death was natural.\n\n[READ ALSO] Oromoni: Lagos Govt Clears Five Dowen Students, Staff, Orders Release Of Suspects\n\nAccording to the police commissioner, the police position was the submission of Dr S. Soyemi, the consultant pathologist who led a team of pathologists to carry out the autopsy.\n\nThe findings, he said, confirmed that there was no evidence to establish a case of torture, bullying and forceful application of poisonous substances against the students and staff of the school arrested by the police.\n\nOdumosu stressed that all the suspects denied the allegations of torture, bullying, and administering of poisonous substances to the deceased.\n\nHe added that the allegation that the deceased was forced to join a cult group was also not established, as the students interviewed denied the claim.\n\nThe briefing held two days after the Lagos State government cleared the students and employees of the school accused of complicity in the death of Sylvester.\n\nThis followed the legal advice of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) in Lagos, Ms Adetutu Oshinusi, that the interim and final autopsy reports issued in Lagos and Delta were in agreement as to the cause of death.\n\nSepticaemia, lobar pneumonia with acute pyelonephritis, pyomyositis of the right ankle and acute bacteria pneumonia, all due to severe sepsis led to the death of Sylvester.\n\nRead the full text of the police commissioner\u2019s briefing below:\n\nSYLVESTER OROMONI JNR: UPDATE ON INVESTIGATION\n\nGentlemen of the Press, I am compelled by necessity of duty and in the interest of justice, transparency and openness, to invite you here this afternoon to give an update on investigation carried out into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, the 12- year-old student of Dowen College, Lekki.\n\nThe case has attracted comments and reactions from different quarters, individuals and parents insinuating a cover-up. The comments, reactions and insinuations have necessitated the need to do this press conference.\n\nGentlemen of the press, following a formal complaint received on 2nd December 2021 via a petition dated 1/12/2021 written by V.O. Grant & Co, and signed by A.E. Efole et al, the DPO Maroko was immediately directed to carry out preliminary investigation into the incident notwithstanding that the incident was not reported at any police station.\n\nSame day the petition was received, DPO Maroko commenced preliminary investigation by visiting the Dowen College, Maroko on a fact-finding mission. However, due to the seriousness of the incident and the dare need to carry out diligent investigation, the State CID was directed by me to take over investigation of the case with immediate effect.\n\nIn compliance with this directive, the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti took over the case on 3rd December 2021 and continued investigation in earnest. In the course of investigation, eight suspects were arrested. The suspects included three House Masters of the College and five students who were said to have been mentioned by the deceased before his death.\n\nThe suspects were; Students i. Ansel Temile \u2018m\u2019 aged 14 ii. Michael Kashamu \u2018m\u2019 aged 15 iii. Kenneth Inyang \u2018m\u2019 aged 15 iv. Favour Benjamin \u2018m\u2019 aged 16 v. Edward Begue \u2018m\u2019 aged 16 House masters vi. Valentine Igbokwe \u2018m aged 45 vii. Ahmed Bariyu \u2018m\u2019 aged 52 viii. Adesanya Olusegun \u2018m aged 42\n\nA remand warrant dated 7th December 2021 was obtained at the Yaba Magistrate Court to enable the police detain the suspects for 21 days in the first instance while investigation continued. On 9th December 2021, all the parties including the deceased\u2019s family, the school management, and witnesses were interviewed by me at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja.\n\nDuring the open interview, it was unanimously agreed that another autopsy should be carried out where pathologists from all parties would be present. Investigation was extended to Delta State and Abuja.\n\nGentlemen of the press, I will like to state here that investigation revealed that same case was reported at the Area Command Warri, Delta State on 1st December 2021. It has also been established that a post-mortem examination was initially carried out on 2nd December 2021 by a Consultant Pathologist, Dr. Clement Vhriterhire of the Central Hospital, Warri, Delta State.\n\nThe result of the first autopsy dated 10th December 2021 attributed cause of death to \u2018acute lung injury due to ?? chemical intoxication in a background of blunt force trauma\u2019. However, toxicology screening was recommended and carried out. While waiting for the result of the toxicology, another autopsy was ordered by the Coroner Magistrate in Lagos because of the status of jurisdiction.\n\nThe corpse was, therefore, moved with armed police escorts from Delta State to Lagos State by TOS Funeral and the autopsy conducted at the expense of the Lagos State Government. The second autopsy was carried out at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital on 14th December 2021 in the presence of representatives of all the parties involved in the case.\n\nThe second autopsy was carried out by Dr. S.S Soyemi, the Consultant Pathologist and Chief Examiner, Department of Pathology and Forensic Sciences, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos. The autopsy was witnessed by the following:\n\nDr Uwon Eze, a consultant Pathologist from UCH represented Timile\u2019s family Dr. Badmus Kabiru, Consultant Pathologist from LUTH represented Dowen College\n\niii. Dr. Nwigwe Chikodili Isabella, Consultant Pathologist from Military Hospital Yaba represented Edward Brown, student of Dowen College\n\nDr. Clemet Vhriterhire, Consultant Pathologist who performed the first autopsy represented the family of the deceased Dr. Musa Stephen Itopa, Consultant Pathologist from UPTH represented Michael Kasamu, student of Dowen College Dr. F.E. Emiogun, Consultant Pathologist in LASUTH\n\nvii. Dr. O.O. KilaUvie-Emegbo, Consultant Pathologist in LASUTH\n\nviii. Dr. O.O. Onayemi, senior Registrar in LASUTH\n\nDr. M.Salisu, senior Registrar on autopsy posting in LASUTH Dr. A.C. Chima, Registrar from ABU on autopsy posting in LASUTH Dr. F. Emetomah, Registrar\n\nxii. CSP Rasak Oseni, Homicide Section, represented the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State Command.\n\nXiii. DSP Olusegun Bamidele, Homicide Section, also represented the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State Command\n\nXiv. Sgt. Shola Adeniyi, Homicide Section, represented the Nigeria Police Force, Lagos State Command.\n\nBefore the expiration of the 21 days remand order, the families of the students applied for their bail at the Magistrate Court 1 Yaba. The application was approved hence the students who were earlier remanded at Boys Home, Oregun were granted bail.\n\nThe House Masters were also granted bail after the expiration of the 21 days remand order. The result of the second autopsy carried out in Lagos was released on 21st December 2021. The result attributed the cause of death to \u2018Septicaemia, lobar pneumonia with acute pyelonephritis and pyomyositis of the right ankle\u2019.\n\nOn 30th December 2021, the toxicology screening results of the first autopsy carried out in Warri was released. The result issued and signed by Dr Clement Vhriterhire, same doctor who carried out the initial autopsy attributed the cause of death to \u2018acute bacterial pneumonia due to severe sepsis\u2019\n\nAt the end of diligent investigation carried out so far, there is no evidence to establish a case of torture, bullying and forceful application of poisonous substances against the suspects. All the suspects denied the allegations of torture, bullying and administering of poisonous substances to the deceased.\n\nAllegation that the deceased was being forced to join a cult group was also not established as other students interviewed denied this. Final results of the post-mortem and toxicology examination conducted both at Warri and Lagos agreed that the deceased died a natural death. For purpose of clarification, it is pertinent to convey to members of the public in simple terms, the commentary/submission of Dr. SS Soyemi, the consultant pathologist who led a team of pathologists to carry out the autopsy.\n\nHe declared and I quote: \u2018Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, a 12-year old student of Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos, reportedly died on November 30, 2021, at a private hospital in Warri, Delta State. It was alleged that the deceased was physically assaulted and poisoned in the school prior to death.\n\n\u2018The first autopsy was done in Warri on December 2, 2021. Following an order for a second autopsy, the body of the deceased was brought to Lagos for a second autopsy. Our findings at the second autopsy include marked pallor of organs, pneumonia (infection of the lungs), infections of the liver and kidneys, as well as the heart.\n\n\u2018These infections emanated from the ankle infection described earlier in the report. Microscopic sections also confirmed these findings. Death was caused by Septicaemia following infections of the lungs and kidneys arising from the ankle wound. No evidence of blunt force trauma in this body. The findings in the oesophagus and stomach are not compatible with chemical intoxication. Death, in this case, is natural.\u2019\n\nDespite this and following legal procedure, the case file was duplicated and sent to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. Legal advice, however, indicated that \u2018there is no prima facie case of murder, involuntary manslaughter and or malicious administering of poison with intent to harm\u2019 against the students and the House Masters, hence they cannot be prosecuted. Hence, they were all released on bail. The final result of the autopsy and DPP advice were officially released by the state government earlier in the week.\n\nGentlemen of the Press, in spite of the transparent investigation, carried out by the police and the non-establishment of prima facie case against the suspects, some members of the Ijaw Youths Council, Lagos led by one Comrade Henry Oyobolo protested in front of Bowen College for over two hours yesterday 6th January 2022.\n\nThe protesters, including masquerades, carried placards and were drumming, thereby causing panic and apprehension. The protesters who conducted themselves in a manner capable of causing breach of peace also caused temporary traffic jam. But for the professional way the police managed the protest, it would have led to violence.\n\nMuch as we commiserate with the bereaved family on the death of their lovely and promising child, it is advised that the protesters and other individuals or groups who are still aggrieved should go to the law court to seek redress instead of taking the law into their own hands.\n\nThus, members of the public who may have any misgivings about the outcome of the police investigation, medical enquiry and legal advice with this case are advised to follow due process in law rather than resorting to self-help.\n\nThe police will not fold their arms and allow any act or omission that could threaten the peace being enjoyed in the state. Thanks and God bless you all.",

          "text": "The Omicron variant of Covid-19 is killing people across the globe and should not be dismissed as mild, the World Health Organization insisted Thursday.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the record numbers of people catching the new variant \u2014 which is rapid out-competing the previously-dominant Delta variant in many countries \u2014 meant hospitals were being overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWhile Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorised as mild,\u201d Tedros told a press conference.\n\n\u201cJust like previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world.\u201d\n\nJust under 9.5 million new Covid-19 cases were reported to the WHO last week \u2014 a record, up 71 percent on the week before.\n\nBut even this was an underestimate, Tedros said, as it did not reflect the backlog of testing around the Christmas-New Year holidays, positive self-tests not registered, and overburdened surveillance systems missing cases.\n\nVaccination targets slipping away\n\nTedros used his first speech of 2022 to slam the way rich nations hogged available vaccine doses last year, saying it had created the perfect breeding ground for the emergence of virus variants.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the world to share out vaccine doses more fairly in 2022, to end the \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d of Covid-19.\n\nTedros wanted every country to have 10 percent of their population vaccinated by the end of September 2021 and 40 percent by the end of December.\n\nNinety-two of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states missed the target set for the end of 2021 \u2014 indeed 36 of them had not even jabbed the first 10 percent, largely due to being unable to access doses.\n\nTedros wants 70 percent jabbed in every country by mid-2022.\n\nOn the current pace of vaccine roll-out, 109 countries will miss that target.\n\n\u201cVaccine inequity is a killer of people and jobs and it undermines a global economic recovery,\u201d said Tedros.\n\n\u201cBooster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected.\u201d\n\nOmicron is not the end\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that Omicron would be the last variant of concern before the pandemic is over.\n\nIn facing the more transmissible Omicron variant, Van Kerkhove urged people to step up the measures they were already taking to protect themselves against the virus.\n\n[READ ALSO] COVID-19: Election Rallies Cancelled As India Sees Omicron Surge\n\n\u201cDo everything that we have been advising better, more comprehensively, more purposefully,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe need people to hang in there and really fight.\u201d\n\nVan Kerkhove added that she was stunned by how sloppily some people were wearing facemasks.\n\n\u201cIt needs to cover your nose and mouth\u2026 wearing a mask below your chin is useless,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking ahead to this year, Bruce Aylward, the WHO\u2019s frontman on accessing coronavirus tools, added that there was \u201cno need to finish 2022 in a pandemic\u201d.\n\nBut WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that without vaccine equity, \u201cwe will be sitting here at the end of 2022 having somewhat the same conversation, which, in itself, would be a great tragedy\u201d.",

          "title": "US Supreme Court Conservatives Lean Against Biden Business Vaccine Policy",
          "text": "Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Friday questioned the legality of President Joe Biden\u2019s pandemic-related vaccine-or-testing mandate for large businesses but appeared more receptive to his administration\u2019s vaccine requirement for healthcare facilities at a time of surging COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe court\u2019s nine justices, who are all vaccinated, heard more than 3-1/2 hours of arguments in two cases that test presidential powers to combat a raging public health crisis that already has killed roughly 835,000 Americans.\n\nThe conservative justices, who hold a 6-3 majority, signaled sympathy toward arguments by the state of Ohio and a business group that the federal workplace safety agency that issued the rule affecting businesses with at least 100 workers \u2013 a policy requiring vaccines or weekly COVID-19 tests for more than 80 million employees \u2013 overstepped its legal authority.\n\nThe challengers have asked the court to block the policy before the administration begins enforcement on Monday.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservatives suggested that the 1970 law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) did not authorize this type of broad emergency action.\n\nThey seemed more open to a separate federal vaccine requirement that states led by Missouri and Louisiana are asking the court to block nationwide. It covers an estimated 10.3 million workers at about 76,000 healthcare facilities including hospitals and nursing homes that accept money from the Medicare and Medicaid government health insurance programs for elderly, disabled and low-income Americans.\n\nThe conservative justices have shown skepticism toward sweeping actions by federal agencies in past rulings. Decisions in both cases are expected quickly.\n\nThe arguments underscored how divisive the issue of vaccination has become in the United States, as in many nations.\n\nThe three liberal justices indicated that both policies were justified during a pandemic showing no signs of abating, with an upswing in COVID-19 cases driven by the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant.\n\n\u201cThis is a pandemic in which nearly a million people have died,\u201d liberal Justice Elena Kagan said, referring to the U.S. death toll during arguments over the OSHA mandate. \u201cIt is by far the greatest public health danger that this country has faced in the last century. More and more people are dying every day. More and more people are getting sick every day. \u2026 And this is the policy that is most geared to stopping all this.\u201d\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh indicated that the OSHA rule could be invalid under a legal doctrine that says Congress must provide a clear statement on a specific issue in order for a federal agency to issue broad regulations on it.\n\nThe conservative justices suggested Congress or individual states would be better suited to act.\n\nRoberts voiced doubt that the law passed by Congress establishing OSHA empowered it to take such action.\n\n\u201cThat was 50 years ago that you\u2019re saying Congress acted. I don\u2019t think it had COVID in mind. That was almost closer to the Spanish flu than it is to today\u2019s problem,\u201d Roberts said, referring to the pandemic that occurred a century ago.\n\nThe White House has said the two temporary mandates will save lives and strengthen the U.S. economy by increasing the number of vaccinated Americans by the millions.\n\n\u201cI would find it would be unbelievable to be in the public interest to stop these vaccinations,\u201d liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said.\n\nSome justices raised the possibility of the court issuing a temporary stay blocking the OSHA rule while the court decides how to proceed.\n\nRoberts and Kavanaugh appeared more sympathetic to the Biden administration\u2019s arguments regarding the healthcare facilities mandate issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for administering those programs.\n\nKavanaugh noted that private healthcare providers did not challenge the mandate that states are contesting. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett suggested the government could require vaccinations in certain facilities but not others.\n\nGorsuch seemed skeptical of the policy as a whole, questioning whether CMS has the authority to issue a vaccine regulation because such action affects an employer\u2019s staffing decisions, which Congress has said the agency could not do as part of its Medicaid and Medicare funding requirements.\n\nGorsuch said that \u201cyou cannot use the money as a weapon to control these things.\u201d\n\nAll the government is doing, Kagan said, is \u201cto say to providers, you know what, basically, the one thing you can\u2019t do is to kill your patients, so you have to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor participated in the arguments from her chambers.

          "title": "Arbery Killers Sentenced to Life in Prison; No Parole for Father, Son",
          "text": "Three white men convicted of murder for chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery were sentenced to life in prison Friday, with a judge denying any chance of parole for the father and son who armed themselves and initiated the deadly pursuit of the 25-year-old Black man.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley said Arbery left his home for a jog and ended up running for his life for five minutes as the men chased him until they finally cornered him. The judge paused for a minute of silence to help drive home a sense of what that time must have felt like for Arbery, whose killing became part of a larger national reckoning on racial injustice.\n\n\u201cWhen I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles. I kept coming back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores,\u201d he said, mentioning the neighborhood where Arbery was killed.\n\nGreg and Travis McMichael grabbed guns and jumped in a pickup truck to chase Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. Their neighbor, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael firing close-range shotgun blasts into Arbery.\n\n\u201cAhmaud Arbery was then hunted down and shot, and he was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands,\u201d the judge said. Walmsley ordered the McMichaels to serve life without parole and granted Bryan a chance to earn parole after serving at least 30 years in prison.\n\nA few dozen supporters cheered Arbery\u2019s family as they exited onto the courthouse steps Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cToday your son has made history, because we have people who are being held accountable for lynching a Black man in America!\u201d said Benjamin Crump, a civil attorney representing the family.\n\nMurder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison under Georgia law unless prosecutors seek the death penalty, which they opted against in this case. During the sentencing hearing, Arbery\u2019s family had asked the judge to show no lenience in deciding whether to grant an eventual chance at parole.\n\nArbery\u2019s sister recalled his humor, describing him as a positive thinker with a big personality. She told the judge her brother had dark skin \u201cthat glistened in the sunlight,\u201d thick, curly hair and an athletic build, factors that made him a target for the men who pursued him.\n\n\u201cThese are the qualities that made these men assume that Ahmaud was a dangerous criminal and chase him with guns drawn. To me, those qualities reflect a young man full of life and energy who looked like me and the people I loved,\u201d Jasmine Arbery said.\n\nArbery\u2019s mother said she suffered a personal, intense loss made worse by a trial where the defense was that her son had made bad choices that led to his death.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact. They chose to target my son because they didn\u2019t want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community,\u201d Wanda Cooper-Jones said. \u201cAnd when they couldn\u2019t sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him.\u201d\n\nThe sentences matched the recommendation of prosecutor Linda Dunikoski, who said all deserved the mandatory life sentence for showing \u201cno empathy for the trapped and terrified Ahmaud Arbery.\u201d\n\nContending the McMichaels still believed they didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Dunikoski disclosed Friday that Greg McMichael gave Bryan\u2019s cellphone video of the shooting to an attorney, who leaked it.\n\n\u201cHe believed it was going to exonerate him,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nThe McMichaels\u2019 defense attorneys argued that their clients deserved the possibility of parole because the killing was an unplanned, unintentional act. Bryan\u2019s lawyer said he showed remorse and cooperated with police, turning over the cellphone video of the shooting to help them get to the truth.\n\n\u201cMr. Bryan isn\u2019t the one who brought a gun,\u201d Kevin Gough said. \u201cHe was unarmed. And I think that reflects his intentions.\u201d\n\nBryan is 52, raising the chances that he will spend the remainder of his life in prison even with the chance of parole after serving 30 years.\n\nThe guilty verdicts against the men handed down the day before Thanksgiving prompted a victory celebration outside the Glynn County courthouse. In addition to murder, all three men were also convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Travis and Greg McMichael were each sentenced to an additional 20 years for aggravated assault.\n\nDefense attorneys have said they plan to appeal the convictions. They have 30 days after sentencing to file them.\n\nNext month, the McMichaels and Bryan face a second trial, this time in U.S. District Court on federal hate crime charges. A judge has set jury selection to begin Feb. 7. Prosecutors will argue that the three men violated Arbery\u2019s civil rights and targeted him because he was Black.",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Governors Convene Emergency Meeting to Actualise National Convention",
          "text": "The Governors of Nigeria\u2019s All Progressives Congress (APC) have summoned an emergency meeting in Abuja on Sunday to pick a date for the party\u2019s National Convention, in line with the advice of President Muhammadu Buhari that the party should put its house in order to avoid being kicked out by the opposition in 2023.\n\nThe Chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, who disclosed this on Friday after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, said \u201cthe party is still hopeful that a date in February is still feasible for the convention\u201d during which new national officers of the party would be elected.\n\nIn a related development, five aggrieved members of the APC have commenced legal action in Abuja, seeking an order to stop the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, from going ahead with the convention. This is the latest in the series of court cases rocking the party.\n\nLalong said the President\u2019s warning to the party that it risks losing power to the opposition, including the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), was a signal to the APC to have a seamless convention \u201cso that it will not disintegrate.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the President\u2019s warning was for the party to redouble its efforts and do the needful.\n\nLalong said: \u201cYou know when convention is coming, there will be fears here and there. Some people will tell you it will work,some will say it will not work. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but the visit to the President has already assured us and you know that there is already a notice that all the governors are meeting on Sunday. By Sunday, we will tell you when we\u2019re holding the convention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken a date already. I think during our first date before Christmas, we said we\u2019re going to do the convention in February and we are still working on it. As far as I\u2019m concerned, except things change from another angle, we\u2019re working for our convention in February.\n\n\u201cThe President was raising his fears, but we\u2019ve already given him assurances that nothing will stop us from having a very peaceful election. Some parties have done their own; the PDP did their own, nothing will stop APC from doing its own.\n\n\u201cSo, all the fears that we\u2019re talking about, which the President also re-echoed, are also telling the governor\u2019s please do more, and keep the party alive. So, by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re going to keep our party alive.\n\n\u201cWell, these are things we\u2019re going to discuss, but I\u2019m not drawing conclusion, but I always tell you that a political party is about interests, the interests may be the same, they may not be the same, but at the end of the day, what we\u2019ll do is that we are going to elect people who are going to represent you.\u201d\n\nLalong further assured that the meeting scheduled for tomorrow would address all the contending issues affecting the conduct of the convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople will come with different interests and so when you are preparing like this, you have different interests and those different interests will be aired in different ways.\n\n\u201cBut I just want to assure you that in so many ways, when we meet, we\u2019ll harmonise all interests and we\u2019ll come out as one APC and that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping; that whatever will be the interests that we\u2019re going to discuss, I have a very great hope that at the end of the day, our goal is to elect people who will take care of our party, because that will be the beginning of the process towards electing those who will take over from this present government.\u201d\n\nOn whether the several court cases pending against the party and its leadership will not abort plans of the convention, the governor said: \u201cThere are procedures for holding court processes. Many of the court processes were there when we set up the caretaker committee, but up to this moment, if you go to take a census of some of the court proceedings, you will realise that a lot of them have been resolved out of court. So, it\u2019s still the duty of the party, it\u2019s still part of the functions of the party to resolve.\n\n\u201cBut we must not wait to resolve all court processes before you go to the convention. I don\u2019t think so because there are also machineries for resolving court processes, even after convention. I had a court process in my state, that did not stop me from going on and at the end of the day, we resolved the court process and we\u2019re still going on, preparing and waiting for convention.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC would meet the speculated February 5 date for the convention in view of the need for mandatory 21-day notice to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Lalong said \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the chairman of the convention committee, but I want to assure you that we\u2019ve called a meeting for Sunday and if there is a meeting on Sunday, and you\u2019re thinking about next Friday. Just wait and see what will happen before next Friday. I don\u2019t want to draw conclusions now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already talking of litigation, you draw conclusions, somebody will go and file a case tomorrow. So, I don\u2019t want us to draw a conclusion on that, but I want to assure you that we are meeting. We already sampled the minds of many of the governors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019re going to get a date and then with the admonition given by the President, it\u2019s a warning signal to all of us to sit up and ensure that we have a seamless, very clean, fair and transparent convention so that our party will not get disintegrated.\u201d\n\nAggrieved Members Move to Stop Convention\n\nFive aggrieved members of the APC on Friday commenced legal action to stop the planned National Convention of the party by dragging the CECPC, under Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, before a Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe aggrieved members want the court to issue an order restraining the Buni-led CECPC from going ahead with the convention.\n\nRecall that some members of the APC are clamouring for a change in date of the scheduled national convention.\n\nThe suit dated January 4, 2022, has as plaintiffs, Suleiman Usman, Muhammed Shehu, Samaila Isahaka, Idris Isah and Audu Emmanuel.\n\nThe APC, Buni and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were listed as 1-3 defendants in the court processes.\n\nThe plaintiffs are praying the court for an order to stop the convention on the grounds that state congresses are yet to be completed in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nLawyer to the plaintiffs, Olusola Ojo raised five questions for the court to determine and also sought eight declarative reliefs.\n\nOne of the reliefs included \u201can order of this Court restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants from organising and conducting the national convention of the 1st defendant unless state congresses of the 1st defendant were first concluded in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\u201d\n\nAPC Set to Deal With Erring Members\n\nWith the National Convention of the APC being threatened by a plethora of crises, the ruling party may have resolved to come down hard on some erring members to ensure discipline and position the APC to retain power in 2023, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAPC\u2019s planned disciplinary actions are said to be fully supported by President Buhari who wants to leave behind a peaceful and united party in 2023.\n\nAccording to the President, the ruling party would shoot itself in the foot if \u201cit fails to resolve the disunity and lack of agreement amongst members of the party.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the decision of the party to sanction some erring members is in tandem with the President\u2019s position to instill discipline within the party.\n\nA source close to the APC National Secretariat in Abuja, who preferred anonymity, said the APC was considering \u201cvery serious and severe disciplinary measures against some people whose activities and utterances are threats to the health of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source adds: \u201cI can tell you categorically that the party is coming down heavily on some party members whose actions are becoming dangerous for the unity of the party. Some of the individuals involved are high-profile.\n\n\u201cI am aware of two governors that have been pencilled down for disciplinary action. One is from the North-west while the other is from the South-west. The governors are said to be throwing stones at the party through their agents. Also, two former governors who are working against the APC secretly have been identified and will be sanctioned at the appropriate time. Also, some Senators and House of Representatives members are fingered in a secret report at the disposal of the party.\n\n\u201cA minister from the South-east was also said to have been working against the interest of the party. The party may soon unmask these characters and deal decisively with them.\u201d\n\nThe source further said \u201ca meeting will be scheduled shortly to address this matter.\u201d\n\nAccording to insiders at the party\u2019s headquarters, the desperation of some individuals, especially aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the party, and groups within the APC remain a big threat to the peace and stability of the party.\n\nAnother highly ranked member of the party, who does not want his name mentioned, wondered why some aspirants for the national chairmanship seat of the APC want to \u201cderail the party at this critical period instead of helping to build it and consolidate on the gains so far achieved by the Buhari government.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThere has to be APC first for these aspirants to realise their aspirations. APC is a big family and it has the capacity to accommodate all interests. Buni is working tirelessly to hold the party together and he needs the support of every stakeholder in order to take the party to greater heights. Buni is not contesting for the party\u2019s chairmanship seat. He will be seeking reelection in Yobe State as second term governor.\n\n\u201cSome political parties have predicted that APC will implode. But I have good news for them \u2013 APC will never implode. It\u2019s one united family. We have internal mechanisms we use in settling matters with dispatch. APC is the party to beat in 2023.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a group within the APC called Progressive Initiative For Change and Development has called on the leadership of the APC to ensure all crises in the party are resolved amicably before any National Convention is conducted.\n\nThe National Coordinator of the Group, Chief Donatus Okereke told journalists in Abuja that the party was clearly not ready for a National Convention with the crisis engulfing some state chapters, urging the national leaders of the party to ensure \u201cproper and thorough reconciliation\u201d before any National Convention is staged.\n\nPGF DG Calls for Buni\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Director General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Lukman Salihu has called on Buni and the Secretary of the party\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe to resign honourably if they can\u2019t conclude preparations for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nLukman stated this in a letter dated January 5, 2022 titled, \u201cAPC National Convention: Urgent Matters for the Survival of APC,\u201d and addressed to the Chairman of PGF and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State.\n\nThe director-general also copied President Buhari and key party leaders in the letter which was sighted by THISDAY.\n\nLukman recalled that on Monday, January 3, 2022, he sent an open letter to all APC leaders titled \u201cPlausibility of February 2022 APC Convention\u201d, which highlighted some of the reasons the APC National Convention should not be postponed.\n\nThe party chieftain pointed out that leaders of the party must understand that the survival of the party was at stake and any attempt to continue to contemplate postponement of the Convention means gambling with the future of the party, which he said was unacceptable.\n\nThe party chieftain said the failure of the Buni-led Committee to implement decisions makes APC leaders complicit and therefore agreeable to acts that are injurious to the survival of the party.\n\nAccording to him, the insinuation in the public is that the reluctance of Buni to proceed with implementation of the decision to hold the APC National Convention on February 5, 2022 as agreed was because governors want to continue to control the party, which to the best of my knowledge is not true.\n\nLukman stressed that some commentators both within the party and in the public have argued that there are deliberate efforts to prevent the convention from holding on February 5, 2022, which was why the CECPC did not make any public announcement or begin to make any preparation.\n\nThe director-general said that APC leaders should imagine the consequences of ruining the electoral potentials of the party in 2023 such that beyond losing the federal government, self-implicated legal challenges are created to weaken the electoral prospects of the party simply because of actions or inactions of the CECPC, especially Buni and Akpanudoedehe.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja, Charles Ajunwa in Lagos",
