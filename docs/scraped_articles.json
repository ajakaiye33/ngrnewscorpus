          "text": "The Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, has said the House may pass the Value-Added Tax bill into law next week.\n\nOluomo, who disclosed this to our correspondent on Friday, said the bill had passed the second reading and gone through a public hearing.\n\nThe assembly had last week held a public hearing a few days after the bill passed through the first and second readings during the plenary.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have done the public hearing and everything. We are trying to compare notes; we have asked all interested parties to submit their memo which they have done.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to make an input or the other, all those things that people want us to put in the bill. So, those are the things we are considering and presently, I am out of the country; when I come back hopefully next week, I should be able to determine when to pass it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Marcus Onobun, has said, the House will consider the VAT bill as soon as it reconvenes on Wednesday.\n\nOnobun said, \u201cWe are currently on recess but we will consider it when we resume. We will lay the matter on the table and see how to deliberate on it but it is a motion that we are considering.\n\n\u201cYou know there was a judgement that the state has the right to collect VAT but there is an appeal judgement ordering a stay of execution. Also, the matter is in court and we must be mindful of the comments.\n\n\u201cHowever, in a federating unit, the states have the right to make laws that will enhance their development. Issues like this that are not expressly stated in the Exclusive List; we can legislate on it. So, these are some of the arguments, I lawyers will be pushing in court for the judges to look at. However, as I said, we are considering it.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The local government areas with doctors are ldo, Ibadan North, Ibadan North-East, Ibadan South-East, Ibadan South-West and Akinyele.\n\n\u201cIn the Oke-Ogun zone, five local government areas have doctors and they are Olorunsogo, Saki West, Itesiwaju, Iseyin, Iwajowa. Five councils do not have one single doctor.\n\n\u201cIn the Ogbomoso zone, out of five local government areas, only Ogbomoso North and Oriire local government areas have doctors. In Oyo zone, out of the four local government areas there, Oyo East is the only council that has a medical doctor, others don\u2019t have any. Out of the three councils in Ibarapa zone, two of them have medical doctors.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, Nigerian Medical Association, Oyo State chapter, Dr Ayotunde Fasunla, told our correspondent that there was a dearth of doctors at some primary health centres in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Oyo State Government has been informed of the shortage of health workers and the urgent need to hire. The state government hired some health workers last year, but the number was far below what was expected. The situation at the PHC is even worse.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary, Oyo State Primary Healthcare Board, Dr Muhideen Olatunji, when contacted told our correspondent that the state government was aware of this problem and \u201cis already engaging more hands to close the gap\u201d.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nSpokesperson of the House of Representatives, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, Saturday said that United Nations, UN, High Level Meeting (HLM) on Tuberculosis and Global TB Caucus has assured of parliamentary support to end the scourge in Nigeria.\n\nThe assurance was given at the official pre-meeting of the Stop TB Partnership Board Event organized by the Global TB Caucus held virtually on September 23rd, 2021.\n\nREAD ALSO:Ending security challenges in Nigeria, a matter of time \u2013 Buhari\n\nThe event was a call for stakeholders to reflect on the journey towards achieving the United Nations High Level Meeting (HLM) on Tuberculosis targets to align their actions with the current realities most especially with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt was also in furtherance of the meeting held in 2018 where world leaders, international Organizations, civil society and affected communities were part of the first ever High Level Meeting on Tuberculosis (HLM on TB), at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nIt will be recalled that in October 2020, the United Nations Secretary-General (UNSG) released a report prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO), with data showing the progress made after the 2018 meeting and where the stand of the global leaders in achieving the targets agreed in the HLM on TB.\n\nThe meeting had in attendance over 60 representatives of various countries around the world.\n\nSpeaking on advancing TB priorities at the national level through parliamentary actions and partnerships, Kalu who represented the Nigerian parliament highlighted that despite the commitments of Heads of State and Governments during the UN HLM on TB in 2018, the realities have continued to pose a threat to the achievement of the set targets especially with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said \u201cDespite these already existing challenges, it is no longer news that the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected our health care systems and services, thereby reversing the gains we were beginning to make as countries.\n\n\u201cDuring the peak of covid-19 pandemic, TB services were massively disrupted, this was further complicated by the stigma, misinformation, rumors, fake news and also a lot of confusion as a result of the similarities in the symptoms of COVID-19 and Tuberculosis.\n\n\u201cHowever, the National TB program was able to overcome these challenges by strengthening the network of private sectors, community workers and partnership with the Nigeria Center for disease Control (NCDC) by integrating TB program into some components of Covid19 control measures.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker who represents Bende Federal Constituency of Abia State added that the National Assembly through its legislative activities, collaborations and partnerships remained committed to battling the pandemic and every other disease squarely.\n\n\u201cSo far, the National Assembly of Nigeria through the AIDS, Tuberculosis and malaria control committee and other health related committees is doing everything possible through legislative actions to ensure that the country responds to the pandemic adequately, leaving no disease and no one behind.\n\n\u201cNigeria as a country is working relentlessly towards achieving the UN HLM targets through close working relationships between in-country stakeholders, and relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government.\n\n\u201cThe outcomes of these partnerships are evident in the different advocacy efforts, programs interventions, country specific plans and roadmaps that have been developed since the UN HLM\u201d, Kalu said.\n\nHe further urged the Federal Government and other relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government to ensure effective and efficient implementation of tuberculosis-related policies, including improving government funding as well as other priority interventions in the health sector.\n\nThe lawmaker also assured them that the parliament will prioritize the advocacy as members of the Global TB Caucus towards ending the endemic at the global, regional and national levels.",

Our mission is to help mankind and make the lives of our people better.\n\n\u201cMore doctors are coming to join and we will do our best to ensure people get the best medical treatment, do not forget that this is a very detailed process as you can see here. There are different centers where various ailments are addressed. So, in as much as we want to move fast, we want to be detailed and make sure we really help people who need medical attention.\n\n\u201cI believe we will achieve our target. Right now we have a total of ten doctors from United States of America in different areas of specialty, deployed for this programme, it does not matter what it cost us to bring the American doctors to render the medical services to our people, what matters is the relief the service will give mankind.\n\n\u201cWith due respect, all I can tell you is that I am not looking at how much it takes me, not because the capacity to fund it is not limitless but what I am doing is philanthropy. I do not really want to get into how much it is going to cost to do this.\n\n\u201cHowever, be rest assured that it is an expensive venture because all these medical personnel you see came in from the USA. Just flight ticket alone, you know what it is but the issue is that we want to make sure that people feel the impact of what we are doing and not how much we have spent to achieve that.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Director of the foundation, Sir Azuka Okwuosa, in his speech, said the Medical Fair is not targeted at any segment of the population, but meant for all who have health challenges, assuring that improvement would continue to be recorded on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the enormity of problems in society today, in all aspects of life, everything appears to have collapsed in the country health-wise, in education and every other thing. We have hospitals and health centers scattered in different parts of the country, but most of them are not functional.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing here today is trying to cushion the effects of the sufferings of our people who have health challenges. You can see the huge response which indicates that many have been suffering in silence. So, we feel challenged and I know that what you have seen today is a tip of the iceberg.\n\n\u201cWe intend to expand this medical facility in the shortest possible time to be able to accommodate the teeming number of people who are expecting medical services, as a lot spend millions of naira to go to India and other countries when the issues are at a critical stage and sometimes end up not getting results.\n\n\u201cWe want make his place the first port of call where people can arrest issues at a very early stage to save lives. By this time next year, you will be talking about surgery and more other things in this center.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The communique was jointly signed by His Grace, Most Rev Ignatius Kaigama, the Archbishop of Abuja, and Rev. Fr.

It will be their interest for them to come and defend allegations levelled against them. It\u2019s better they come. We are talking of financial audit now which is a statutory function of this Committee.\n\n\u201cThere is no agency that has immoral right to come and defend budget appropriation in the succeeding year when they have not accounted for what they have spent in the preceding year. It\u2019s a shame. And those of them who believe they are part and parcel of Executive Government, they must know that they are giving executive arm of government a bad name for not coming to account for financial transactions. Moreso that they have been accused by the Auditor General for the Federation.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing here is in accordance with the provisions of our Constitution and we are always quick to remind you that Section 85 which if you read what we are supposed to do as far as the Office of the Auditor General is concerned is that he brings the report to the the Senate and of course, to the House of Representatives for consideration.\u201d",

You can\u2019t subject an innocent and a decent citizen to such horrifying, life-shortening, unforgettable experience and claim to have carried out due diligence based on excellent intelligence.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that in every of this kind of EFCC operation, nay any other security arm in Nigeria, is fraught with visiting a very high degree of both mental and physical torture on their targets who, often times are innocent, as exemplified in the case of Norah\u201d.\n\nIt reminded EFCC that it was this form of brutality visited on Nigerians, especially the youths and innocent, that birthed the nationwide ENDSARS protest, and cannot forget the dire consequences in a hurry.\n\nThe NUJ further stressed, \u201cIt is trite that no society is without criminal elements. But in hunting down these criminal elements, the security agents must, as a matter of the rules of engagement, employ utmost discretion and apply high degree of caution in tracking their targets as invading the homes of the innocent constitutes the worst form of violation of the fundamental human rights of citizens.\n\n\u201cIn this digital age, it is high time the EFCC reviewed its modus operandi by deploying technology in its operations of tracking suspects, to end its constant picking on wrong targets and subjecting innocent citizens to untold torture and national embarrassment, \u201cthe body added.\n\nThe Abia NUJ release partly stated, \u201cNorah\u2019s account of the incident depicts a horror scene from a hit office box not even seen in security operations against the dreaded drug czars of Columbia.\n\n\u201cAfter subjecting the poor lady and other occupants of the building to over two hours of gruelling physical stress, emotional trauma and destruction of their properties in the name of searching for non-existent incriminating evidence, the operatives declared \u201cwe have just wasted our time.\n\n\u201cThe declaration, in clear language, is a wholehearted, voluntary expression and admission of a disastrous omission of a mission; that they were in in the wrong place clearly for the wrong reason and at the wrong time.

          "title": "Chairmanship: More cracks in South West PDP",
          "text": "- Advertisement -\n\nAhead the national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) tentatively scheduled to hold next month, there are strong indications that a fresh crisis may rock the South-West zone of the party over who should be the next national chairman of the troubled party. \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor, reports.\n\nWith leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) holding series of meeting during the week to put finishing touches to plans for the party\u2019s national convention expected to hold either next month or later in the year, stakeholders in the southwest zone of the party are now holding divergent opinion over who, among the aspirants from the zone, should be supported for the national chairmanship position. This is just as another school of thought within the zone is of the opinion that the southwest should jettison the chairmanship slot for the 2023 Vice Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\nThe Nation gathered that the current situation within the party in the zone is gradually generating a lot of bad that observers fear may lead to another round of confrontations among leaders and chieftains of the party in the southwest. According to very reliable party sources, external interferences from PDP leaders and chieftains outside the southwest is not helping matters as the various chairmanship hopefuls from the southwest intensify their struggle for both local and external endorsements ahead of the 2021 national convention.\n\nAmidst insinuations that it may zone the national chairmanship slot to the southwest, the PDP zoning committee, presided over by the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, met on Thursday. The party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) had at its 93rd meeting constituted the 45-member committee to decide on the zoning of all offices of the NWC. While it appears the opposition party is set to compensate the southwest for the alleged ill-treatment it received in 2017 in its quest for the national chairmanship seat, renewed wrangling and intrigues within the party signal a zone that is not in agreement over the matter.\n\nStill a divided house\n\nThe Nation gathered that all efforts by various stakeholders to get the PDP in the zone to adopt a consensus candidate ahead of the convention have failed as the aspirants and their supporters refused to budge. \u201cAll of them are claiming to have the backings and supports of some party bigwigs outside the southwest. Most of them are unwilling to subsume their ambition under the general interest of the party in the zone. It is not true that no effort is being made to address the worrisome disunity with which we are approaching the contest,\u201d a party leader from Oyo state told our correspondent.\n\nFindings also revealed that party leaders like Chief Ebenezer Babatope had called on PDP chieftains in the zone to avoid a repeat of what befell them in 2017 by uniting behind a formidable candidate instead of presenting multiple candidates for the position of national chairmanship at the convention. \u201cChief Babatope specifically warned that the slot my not at the end of the day, be zoned exclusively to the southwest. He suggested an arrangement that will enable party chieftains in the zone to decide on who should be the candidate ahead of the convention,\u2019 our source, who is a zonal party official, said.\n\nAnother PDP chieftain, who spoke in confidence, told The Nation that the Southwest caucus is working hard to put its house in order so as to ensure a victorious outing. He however laments that the reconciliation efforts embarked upon by the Taofeek Arapaja-led zonal leadership appear to have suffered some setbacks since the scramble for the national chairmanship position by some eminent PDP chieftains in the zone started. \u201cI am saying it is not true that we are not working on reconciliation. Immediately we were sworn in, we started reaching out to those aggrieved. We worked hard and we were seeing results.\n\n\u201cBut since this struggle for national chairmanship or Vice Presidential ticket started, the party has been thrown into a fresh, more complicated confusion. I can tell you for free that you cannot even say for sure who is with who, or who is where. The camps have further been broken down and there have been a lot of realignments. A good example is the current situation between Governor Seyi Makinde and Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola. They are currently not on the same page as far as the national chairmanship position is concerned. Don\u2019t forget that they were in the same camp all along before now,\u201d our source added.\n\nFresh cracks\n\nJust as indications emerged that Governor Makinde may have joined the camp promoting the chairmanship aspiration of the former governorship candidate of the party in Ondo State, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), some of his well-known political allies within the southwest zone are rooting for some other candidates. Party sources claimed during the week that the Oyo state governor has agreed to join the likes of Vice President Atiku Abubakar to see to the emergence of Jegede as PDP\u2019s national chairman at the convention. The Nation gathered that the development is the outcome of a series of negotiations.\n\nBut former Ekiti State governor, Segun Oni, said PDP leaders and chieftains in the southwest zone were solidly behind Oyinlola in his quest for the PDP national chairmanship position. \u201cThe person that all of us are setting our eyes on is Prince Oyinlola, and he has not yet told us that he\u2019s not going to do it. That\u2019s the man we all want to support for the position of national chairman,\u201d Oni said. Checks by The Nation revealed that the leadership of the party is now divided over the candidacies of Jegede and Oyinlola. Similarly, the state chapter chairmen in the zone are also said to be in disagreement over the same issue.\n\n\u201cAs we speak today, the zonal leadership is unable to speak with one voice on the matter because both Jegede and Oyinlola boast of supporters among us. We are waiting for our leaders in the zone to wade in and resolve the issue amicably so that we all can line up behind one person at the convention. Though Governor Makinde remains the leader of the PDP in the southwest, both Oyinlola and Jegede are not politicians you can push over. So, it is understandable that the situation is as it is. Even in the various states, the state chairmen are hoping to be able to speak in one accord very soon,\u201d our source said.\n\nIntroducing another dimension to the looming crisis, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, immediate past PDP national vice chairman, said the zone is divided into three political zones, which are Ekiti/Ondo Zone, Oyo/Osun Zone and Lagos/Ogun Zone. \u201cOyo/Osun zone cannot contest for the national chairmanship because it has already picked one of the three positions of theNWC that is the national vice chairman, which I contested for, but lost to the former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Taofik Arapaja. So, Osun and Oyo states are out of the picture. If the chairmanship is coming to the South West, it would be contested by Lagos/Ogun.\u201d\n\nSimply put, Olafeso, an ally of former Ekiti governor, Ayo Fayose, is saying Oyinlola cannot be the candidate of the zone for the national chairmanship. \u201cIf we must go by the principles of equity and justice, Ondo/Ekiti and Lagos/Ogun should present candidates for the position if it is eventually zoned to the South West,\u201d he added.\n\nAside Jegede and Oyinlola, others being named in the struggle for the national chairmanship position of the PDP from the southwest include former Deputy National Chairman, Chief Olabode George, immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, and two-time Lagos Governorship Candidate, Mr. Jimi Agbaje. \u201cI understand there are other people interested in the position. They are also eligible and competent. But wherever the South-West goes is where I will go. I will follow the South-West. \u201cWherever the Yoruba go when the chairmanship position of our party is zoned to the South-West is where I will go. It will not be a do-or-die affair. That\u2019s all I can say for now,\u201d Fayose had said while responding to a question about his rumoured ambition.\n\nAnother dimension\n\nBut as the countdown to the October 2021 National Convention for the election of new members of the National Working Committee (NWC) continues, some stalwarts within the party are said to be insisting that the zone should forget about the national chairmanship and show serious interest in producing either the presidential candidate or the running mate. A source told The Nation that ex-governor Fayose is one of those promoting the agitation for the zone to reject the national chairmanship slot if it is exclusively zoned to it.\n\nFactional chairman of the party in Lagos State, Deji Doherty, is not hiding his preference for the presidential ticket as against the ongoing clamour for the position of national chairman. \u201cThe zone should leave the chairmanship position to the South East, or South-South. We should fight at the national convention, and at the committee, level to get the number two position in the country. That is my own candid position. It is the right time that the PDP should provide a South West vice president. The president in APC is from the North and the vice president is from the South West,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking emphatically on what should be the position of the party on the matter as the convention draws nearer, Doherty said, \u201cIf we are going to zone the president to the North for the first time in the history of the PDP, we should have a South West vice president. Everything is tilting towards that end, and for me, I am looking at a situation whereby the zone gets the slot of vice president.\u201d Not a few people are saying the Lagos PDP chieftain may have spoken the mind of the Fayose camp, given his prominence as one of its leaders in the southwest.",

          "title": "Power rotation: Southern leaders, MBF slam Northern elders",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nFor insisting that the presidency would be retained in the North in 2023 and beyond, the Northern Elders Forum has attracted the wrath of leading groups in the South-West, South-East and Middle Belt. They have slammed the Northern leaders, saying they were living in the past.\n\nPan Yoruba socio-cultural political organisation, Afenifere, said the Northern elders were like a drowning ship clinging to whatever it could. Director, Research and Strategy for Afenifere, Dr Akin Fapohunda said: \u201cThey don\u2019t know that the Middle-Belt is out. Can they reckon with Benue, Plateau, the way it was during the civil war? Can they reckon with Southern Kaduna as part of the North?\u201d\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo said the gentleman\u2019s agreement on power rotation between the North and the South should be sustained by all means.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said for\n\njustice, equity and fairness, power must rotate to the South East in 2023.\n\nPresident, Middle Belt Forum, Dr Bitrus Porgu said power shift is an arrangement by political parties, not that of northern elders.\n\n\u201cIt is not for northern elders to determine what happens in PDP, APC or any political party for that matter. It is what the parties want to do that will carry the day. So, they are just making a political statement,\u201d he said. Leading Igbo groups, including the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Women wing, Concerned Igbo Stakeholders Forum (CISF), and Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), slammed the spokesman of Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, for declaring that the north would retain power in 2023 and beyond.\n\nThey said Nigeria was not an estate of the north, adding that the era of one region lording it over the rest of the country was long gone. Leader of the Concerned Igbo Stakeholders Forum (CISF), Chukwuma Okenwa, in a statement in Enugu, described such comments as very disappointing and an aspersion to the intelligence and patience of southerners.\n\nHe said such comments were capable of exacerbating the already fragile peace of the country, by further fueling secessionist movements.\n\nFor the COSEYL, it was unfortunate that a man of his standing whom the youths looked up to for better direction and guidance held such view on such important and sensitive issue.\n\nExpressing their disappointment, President General of the group, Goodluck Ibem and Secretary General, Kanice Igwe, in a statement said the likes of Baba-Ahmed wanted Nigeria to return to pre-amalgamation, when there were Northern and Southern Protectorates.\n\nThe youth leaders said: \u201cIt is a well-known fact that the North cannot produce Nigerian President without the support of the Southern Nigerians. President Buhari had the full support of the North and he contested in 2003 and he lost. He contested again in 2007 and 2011 and lost. He won the election in 2015 when he aligned with the Southern part of the country who voted for him and he emerged as president.\n\n\u201cWe are very surprised that Hakeem has suddenly forgotten so soon how President Buhari emerged as president. History doesn\u2019t lie, he should go back to history to refresh his memory.\u201d\n\nFor the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Women Organisation, since the North was very determined to lord it over the Southern Nigeria perpetually, then they can prepare their votes and vote a President of Northern Nigeria and not a President of the entire Nigeria. Chairman, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Abia Onyike said the northern elders were daydreaming. He said: \u201cThe North is no longer a monolithic power block today. Unless a miracle happens, I don\u2019t see the core North and the Middle Belt operating as one cohesive political entity. President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has divided and devastated the old Northern block.\u201d\n\nIgbo stakeholders\u2019 leader, Okenwa said in the spirit of equity and fairness that a president from southern extraction, specifically the South-East, should be a non-negotiable agenda. According to him, Southern Nigeria is more united than ever; and will vehemently resist any attempt to impose a Northern President on Nigerians come 2023.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, New York\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has told world leaders at the 76th Session of the high-level General Debate of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, to set term limits especially for African leaders.\n\nHis call came after the continent has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one recently in Guinea), and one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, as well as an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president.\n\nPresident Buhari stressed that the recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power on the continent must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place.\n\n\u201cThese include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n\u201cThere are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long-term investments and more effective international cooperation.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention.\n\n\u201cThis will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n\u201cIn West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\n\u201cNigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual member-states we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\u201d\n\nAs regards COVID-19 vaccine, the Nigerian President said this year\u2019s theme of \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking the international communities for the assistance received from partners and friends all over the world, said: \u201cVaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Achike Udenwa: If you kill Nnamdi Kanu, another will rise",
          "text": "Former Imo State governor, Chief Achike Udenwa has said only a political solution could resolve the IPOB and Nnamdi Kanu issue, noting that legal options wouldn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry said Northern elders were being confrontational over its position on power rotation in 2023.\n\nYou have always harped on power rotation between the North and the South, as a way of ensuring peaceful coexistence in the country. However, within the week, some Northern elders said the region should continue after President Buhari. What is your reaction on this?\n\nThough power rotation is not constitutional, but it is conventional. We have done it all the time, to rotate power between the North and the South since 1999 till now. First, it was Obasanjo from the South; then to Yar\u2019Adua, from the North; to Jonathan from the South and now Buhari, from the North. So, morally, anybody serious with One Nigeria, united Nigeria, should not be suggesting that power remains in the North. It was credited to Hakeem, I hope he is not stating the opinion of Northern Elders Forum because that will be vey confrontational and will not be good for our polity. Power should rotate.\n\nEven your party, PDP that has rotation principle, its body language suggests that the party may zone the presidency to the North. What is your view on this?\n\nI don\u2019t know where you got the body language thing. I haven\u2019t seen the body language. What PDP has done so far is to set up zoning committee, which has representatives from all the zones in the country. This committee has just started working. So, I don\u2019t know where you got the body language, maybe from what people are saying. Everybody has his opinion and his wishes. Not even opinion, some people may wish it remains in the North and some people will wish it comes down to the South. So, you hear all sorts of thing. Until that committee finishes its work, considers all the variables and comes out with a zoning formulae, and tells the party what they recommended. It is left for the National Executive Committee of the party to accept or reject their recommendations. What the NEC finally approves is what we consider as the opinion of PDP, not anybody\u2019s personal opinion. Let us not speculate until we have finally heard from the committee and NEC of the party.\n\nHowever, if they decide that it goes to the North, what will be your position?\n\nThey will give enough reasons to justify that, and we will also look at the reasons. The recommendation of the zoning committee is not final; it is still subject to the NEC approval. We will look at whatever reasons they would give and see how tenable such reasons are. I cannot begin to preempt what will happen or what will not happen. Until we go through the entire processes, we are still at the preliminary, which is for the committee to meet and consider everything. They will go deep before they come out with recommendation, then the NEC will look at it and debate it. NEC is not a one-man body; it is made up of eminent members of the party \u2013 governors, NASS members, National Working Committee members, Board of Trustee members. By the time these people sit to consider the report of the zoning committee, they will come out with a position which will be the stand of the party. Today, PDP hasn\u2019t taken any stand.\n\nIn the event that PDP NEC takes a stand and zones it to the North, saying the party is interested in winning the election and the ruling APC does the same, what position should the South that has insisted on power rotation take?\n\nIt is too early for me to say what the South will do because NEC has not taken that decision. For NEC to take that decision there must be some fundamental issues involved. It is too early for me to speculate what the South will do. You know NEC is made up of both North and South; it is not made up of only Northerners or Southerners. So, Southerners will be part of the NEC that will take this final decision. If NEC takes that final decision, it means there was a very genuine reason for that.\n\nThe South-East is asphyxiating following the sit-at \u2013home by IPOB that is affecting the economic activities of the region. How can peace be brought back to that zone?\n\nIPOB has come out to say that there should be no more sit-at-home. The problem you have when you have this type of situation is that while IPOB may be saying one thing, their operatives in the locality are doing another. We must come to a point where sanity will prevail and there will be an understanding by all parties involved because we may not be able to survive having this sit-at-home indefinitely all the time. It is positive that IPOB has come out to officially say, no more sit-at-home. We take it that as its official position. It is left for them to pass it down to their own local level so that we don\u2019t have ugly incidents of people acting on IPOB\u2019s statement and getting into trouble with its local operatives. People are beginning to see that the economy of the South-East is suffering.\n\nIs it not failure of leadership in Igbo land, where IPOB is dictating what happens in the region? One would have expected that the elders should shout at the young ones to stop what they were doing and they would obey?\n\nI don\u2019t think you are right when you say nobody has come out to tell them to stop what they are doing. A lot of people have come out in the social media to tell them the implications of the sit-at-home; its negative impacts on our economy, the society. It is not right to say nobody has come out to say anything. On the other hand, you should know that IPOB is not a body that is constituted by law. It is part of the failure of not just the leadership but of the society. It is easy to start up a mob action, but difficult to control. That is why you must be very careful before you start any mob action. Once a mob action has taken off, it is difficult to arrest; it is not a question of failure of leadership. Which leadership are we talking about? The state governors in the South-East cannot order IPOB to stop. It is not failure of leadership. People keep on pointing out the implications of what is happening and appealing to IPOB.\n\nIt is out of the appeal by the leadership; their calls and the analysis of what is happening that IPOB has come out to say there is no more sit-at-home every Monday.\n\nHow do we tackle this Nnamdi Kanu phenomenon because it is what gave birth to this sit-at-home and other things happening in the South-East. What should the Igbo leadership do?\n\nJust as people have already suggested, a political solution has to be found. If we continue following a legal process to it, it will have no end because the mere fact that you jail Nnamdi Kanu, or even kill him, thinking that the problem is over, another Nnamdi Kanu would come up. There has to be a political solution; there has to be a dialogue. The government of the day has to dialogue not just with the leadership of the Southeast, but in such a dialogue, the youths should also be involved because there are the main people who carry out the action, not the elders. But the leadership can ensure that there is a dialogue. In that dialogue, the issue will be tabled and every side presents its own position. But if it is resolved on the conference table, it is better than a legal solution that will not end it because Nnamdi Kanu is not alone; he has a lot of followers, he has a lot of deputies. If you imprison him today, someone else jumps up.\n\nA dialogue is important. Even though I was not there when President Buhari visited Imo State, he had discussions with South-East leaders. I don\u2019t know what they discussed, but there is no discussion the president or anybody will have with South-East leaders that won\u2019t include the present impasse. Let\u2019s hope that they mentioned it and try to find a way out. I\u2019m sure that would have happen.\n\nSouthern Governors Forum has been meeting and they have come up with resolutions that would reposition the region, the issue of anti open grazing, presidency from the South in 2023, fiscal federalism, VAT collection, etc. Curiously, South-East governors are behind, while South-West and South-South are the ones driving it. What does this portend and what would you have done if it were during your time?\n\nI\u2019m very much surprised that some of our governors are not attending at all; some are sending their deputies, while one sent the Secretary to the State Government. It doesn\u2019t show seriousness on our path. I don\u2019t believe the coincidence of fixing such a meeting was such that no South-East governor was chanced, except the host, Governor Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; the other ones didn\u2019t have chance at all. It shows our governors are not taking this issue seriously, or they are not representing our interests.\n\nIn our time, I was one of those who started the meeting; I hosted it, Rivers State hosted it, Lagos State hosted it first. Enugu also hosted it. We went to many states. It was such a forum where we talked of things, irrespective of your political leaning. We talked of the things concerning our region, not whether you were PDP, AD or ANPP. By then, PDP was in government, but all the other parties attended, and nobody absented. I don\u2019t now know why our governors are not forthcoming. These are things that are fundamental to our own existence, to the survival of this country. The issues involved \u2013 security, open grazing, fiscal federalism. These are basic issues, so why our governors don\u2019t want to get involved is what I cannot say. I\u2019m surprised, I\u2019m shocked because it is a forum where you go, even if you don\u2019t agree, you say it there. The highest thing is that you would refuse to sign the communiqu\u00e9, but you have aired your views. But in a situation where you boycotted the meeting is what I don\u2019t understand. By the time you start sending your deputy, it means you are not serious. It is only when you are unavoidably absent that your deputy can represent you. We even have cases of one or two of the governors who have not even attended it for the first time. They have held three meetings and we have South-East governors who have not attended any. I don\u2019t understand this; it never happened at our time that a state in the South boycotted meetings. Maybe, one was outside the country and his deputy represented them, but in a situation where it has been held three times and you have not attended, it is a serious issue. It shows that some people don\u2019t appreciate what we are going through right now in the country. It is very serious issue, I cannot offer any apologies, and I don\u2019t know what is behind it.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nA number of socio-cultural groups and organisations in the Southern part of Nigeria as well as the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) yesterday launched scathing attacks on Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai over his comments that the anti-open grazing law passed by the Southern states was not implementable.\n\nEl Rufai had said at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Abuja, on Tuesday, that the southern states of Nigeria were politicising the issue of anti open grazing.\n\nHe also said the Northern States Governors Forum had already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production, but that ranching could not be done overnight, even as the law passed by the respective state assembly was not implementable.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere, Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and other groups descended of Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai on what they termed his \u201cunguarded statement.\u201d\n\nThe groups said the governor by his statement merely displayed the supremacist arrogance that the Fulani were noted for.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Alex Ogbonnia said El Rufai\u2019s statement is a manifestation of his arrogance and attempt to intimidate the south.\n\nHe said: \u201cGov El Rufai is trying to show arrogance in the sense that 17 southern governors met and took a position on anti-open grazing and he, one governor, cannot even respect the position of 17 of his colleagues. Secondly, he is contradicting himself. Gov El Rufai talked about open grazing no longer being sustainable and said he is constructing ranches and at the same time he is saying that the anti-open grazing law signed by his southern counterparts is not implementable. Thirdly and most importantly, he is telling us that control of the security infrastructure of the country lies somewhere else and that we don\u2019t have the security apparatus to enforce the anti-open grazing law. That is why we must insist on restructuring of Nigeria so that regional security outfits like Ebubeagu and Amotekun will be fully empowered to implement the law.\u201d\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in a statement by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful affirmed that the bill has come to stay just as it vowed to implement it if the southern governors fail to do so.\n\nPowerful who also maintained that the Kaduna governor\u2019s utterance has exposed his ignorance about the bill, assured that he can never intimidate the south into backing out of their agreement.\n\n\u201cIPOB and Biafra in general can\u2019t afford to allow El-Rufai divide us. The Southern governors have come together against him and his co-traitors in the country and that is what matters. They have bitten more than they can chew.\n\n\u201cAnti-Grazing bill in the South has come to stay and there is nothing anybody can do to change our resolve towards this law against anti- grazing in our territory. El Rufai\u2019s utterances show he\u2019s ignorant.\n\n\u201cIf the Southern governors fail to implement the bill, IPOB will implement it and we would stand shoulder to shoulder with them.\u201d\n\nADF spokesman, Abia Onyike said the Kaduna governor and his gang should bury their heads in shame for destroying the country instead of infuriating already angry Nigerians.\n\nOnyike said: \u201cThat is a demonstration of el-Rufai\u2019s arrogant display of his Fulani supremacist mentality. Otherwise, who is he to dictate to Southern Nigeria? Is he not ashamed of the crisis and violence in Nigeria today, which he and his fellow travellers bequeathed to the country? He should keep quiet and bow out in shame by 2023.\u201d\n\nMASSOB leader, Uchenna Madu said the governor was hypocritical on the ban on open grazing of Fulani cattle by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum. He said that it was unfortunate and disappointing that the wheels of disunity and disaffection among ethnic nationalities was being driven by el-Rufai, a supposed nationalist.\n\nMASSOB said the governor would not decide for the people of Southern Nigeria, pointing out that the era of divide and rule, planting of disaffections and brotherly discord by the Arewa people in the southern regions was no longer fashionable and workable.\n\nAccording to Madu, the governor can no longer withstand the future political reality that will eventually change the political narrative of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cMASSOB advises the governors of Southern regions and other leaders to disregard him and his parasitic teammates because of their venomous hatred against the political interest of people of the southern regions. He has insulted the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Christians in general.\n\n\u201cThe indigenous people\u2019s of southern Nigeria can no longer tolerate such political neglect or callous statements against the interest and justification of their interest in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEven though MASSOB struggle is for Biafra actualization and restoration, we are not against the political and social interest of the south. Every political and economic rights of the people of the southern regions must be supported and sustained,\u201d the MASSOB leader stated.\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu said the submission of Gov El Rufai on the anti-open grazing law was unfounded. He said the Nigerian government has no business taking care of the foreign Fulani, who he said constitute majority of the migratory herders in Nigeria and insisted that they be sent back to their respective countries to be catered for by their home governments.\n\nHe said: \u201cEnforcement of the anti-open grazing law is based on determination. If Gov Samuel Ortom is able to implement anti-open grazing law in Benue State, then it is implementable.

          "text": "Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has faulted the claim by President Muhammadu Buhari at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), that terrorists have been so weakened in Nigeria that they are now preying on soft targets.\n\nThe caucus, in a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said it has reviewed Buhari\u2019s UNGA address and is depressed that it did not reflect the ugly reality of the failures of his administration, as well as the economic, security and social ruins that have confronted the nation under his watch.\n\nAccording to the lawmakers, in reality, insurgents have become so emboldened under Buhari\u2019s watch that they are now attacking military formations, kidnapping and killing gallant officers, while overrunning communities and murdering citizens without restraint.\n\nThe caucus holds that Buhari\u2019s speech is a great disservice to the nation by not presenting the true picture of affairs in the country; the human rights violations, corruption, incompetence in his administration; the excruciating hardship, escalated insecurity, national divisiveness and infrastructural decay under his watch, thereby blocking avenues for desired intervention in the various ailing sectors.\n\nIt also expressed shock over claims in the speech that his administration built isolation centres and emergency hospital wards, all over the country in the fight against Covid-19.\n\nThe lawmakers opined that the speech lacked definite personal commitments towards credible electoral process especially as the nation approaches the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmakers said: \u201cThe speech did not reflect on the closure of schools and crippling of education in many parts of our country, where normal life has been destroyed by terrorists, neither did it show any empathy towards the victims of terrorism attacks. Our caucus is worried that in reflecting on violent conflicts, Mr. President\u2019s address conveyed no personal commitments that can guarantee an end to poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities that are prevalent under his watch, even after identifying such as the causes of conflicts.\n\n\u201cMoreover, our caucus is worried that Mr. President\u2019s speech did not portray any decisive roadmap towards economic recovery and food security; had no personal commitment to end corruption in his administration; had no personal commitment to end borrowing or show a clear-cut plan to repay the huge debt being accumulated by his administration.\u201d\n\nThe caucus therefore urged Buhari to always crosscheck the content given to him by his handlers so as to ensure that his position, especially on the world stage, captures the reality, as well as aspiration prevalent in the country.\n\nThis, according to the lawmakers, is because such addresses ought to serve as unblemished working document for interventions and solutions at various levels of governance.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Laments debt burden, declares obligations gulping bulk of revenue\n\n* Wants outright debt cancellation for severely impacted countries\n\n* UN Scribe urges President to ensure stability of West Africa\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said Boko Haram terrorists, though weakened by the military, \u201care still active in the country, preying on soft targets,\u201d promising that the scourge would soon come to an end.\n\nBuhari, who spoke in New York, United States, while addressing world leaders, including the new President of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, during the 76th session of the Assembly, called for the support of the world body to end the Boko Haram menace.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cMr. President, terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to work closely with the UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n\u201cNigeria has spared no efforts in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria, the Lake Chad region as well as banditry in the North-West and the North-Central. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\u201d\n\nThe President lamented that Nigeria was concerned about illicit trading and movement of small arms, which he said had led to an increase in criminality and insurgency in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari also lamented that countries such as Nigeria spend the bulk of their revenues on debt servicing, leaving little for infrastructure development and other essential aspects of the economy such as healthcare and education.\n\nAs a result, he called for the extension of the debt repayment timeline for developing countries, especially those severely suffering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBuhari said \u201cthere is an urgent need for debt repayment extension for developing countries that are still recovering from the pandemic and also struggling with liquidity challenges.\u201d\n\nHe also called for an inclusive agenda that would build resilience and stability against future shocks; to deliver on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeveloping countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n\u201cI must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20, aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.\n\n\u201cIn addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also took a swipe at the recent coup detat in Mali and Guinea and canvassed the support of the international community to reject the unconstitutional governments in the two West African nations.\n\nHe declared that the recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nThe President warned that democratic gains of the past decades in West Africa \u201care now being eroded\u201d due to these negative trends.\n\nHe affirmed Nigeria\u2019s support to efforts by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) to address this growing challenge, saying, \u201cAs leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\u201d\n\nThe President urged the international community not only to deal with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes of conflicts in the first place.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThese include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\u201d\n\nHe renewed his advocacy for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, outlining steps Nigeria had taken to achieve \u201cmoderate success\u201d in containing the virus and halt its deadly onslaught in the country.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cNigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe rising wave of newer and more contagious strains make this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nCommenting on international trade, the Nigerian leader canvassed for reforms that would engender recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n\u201cMy delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid.\n\n\u201cMy country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also reiterated his call for the reforms of the UN Security Council, stressing that inter-governmental negotiation on the issue, was taking too long.\n\n\u201cNo reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid going in circles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\n\n\u201cIt is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our organisation is called to question.\n\n\u201cWe can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session,\u201d he said.\n\nUN Scribe Urges Buhari to Ensure Stability of West Africa\n\nSecretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, yesterday called on President Buhari to use his leadership qualities towards ensuring the stability of the West African sub-region.\n\nHe also flayed the recent reversal of democratic fortunes in some West African nations including Guinea, Mali and Chad.\n\nThe UN scribe also commended Buhari for his leadership roles in Africa as well as stabilisation of the West African sub-region.\n\nThe Secretary General spoke at a meeting with the Nigerian President at the sidelines of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly taking place in New York.\n\nAccording to the UN Scribe, Africa, especially West Africa was generally seen as an ocean of stability and good governance, but was deeply concerned at recent reversal of fortunes in democratic rule in some parts of the West African sub-region with coups overturning elected institutions.\n\nHe, therefore, urged Buhari to continue to show leadership as he looks up to Nigeria to help stabilise the sub-region in terms of democracy and good governance.\n\nOn terrorism, Guterres commended the efforts of Nigeria on the global phenomenon, assuring the Nigerian leader of the United Nations\u2019 continued support in her efforts to address the prevailing security and humanitarian challenges that have arisen especially with the Internally Displaced Persons.\n\nIn his remarks, Buhari applauded Gutterres for his global leadership and the success of the 76th Session.\n\nHe assured the UN Scribe that Nigeria had achieved appreciable successes in tackling the insecurity caused by terrorists and bandits.\n\nThe President also thanked him for the global organisation\u2019s intervention in activities towards reducing the effects of Climate Change especially with the support for the Great Green Wall programme, which is aimed at arresting desertification across the Sahel as well as the campaign against deforestation in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Buhari added that Nigeria was ready to support and work closely with the United Nations towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nProtests and Counter-protests\n\nWhile President Buhari was reading his speech at the UN, there were protests and counter-protests outside the headquarters of the United Nations.\n\nWhile one was organised by the Yoruba Nation and Biafra agitators, the other was held by OneNation group.\n\nThe agitators, who held placards with various inscriptions, chanted \u201cUN do something, your silence is killing us\u2019, and \u2018help Nigeria to save lives\u2019 among others.\n\nThey also sang Osun State anthem, noting that they want a referendum\n\nOne of the protesters, identified as TJ, said, \u201cWe want them to know what Nigeria is all about. UN needs to intervene to rescue the situation.\u201d\n\nAnother protester, Omo Oba, said the protest was organised to show that people were oppressed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is for all that are oppressed, hungry on the streets of Nigeria, those who want to live a humane lifestyle,\u201d she said.\n\nOn their part, the OneNigeria group held placards promoting the activities of Buhari and preaching unity in Nigeria.\n\nThey displayed placards with inscriptions \u2018Unity in diversity\u2019, and \u2018Nigerians want unity\u2019 among others.\n\nThe Yoruba Nation and Biafra agitators later moved to the Nigerian embassy, to continue their protests.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says FG\u2019s agency remains overseer of VAT unless appellate court rules otherwise\n\nBennett Oghifo\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed has directed the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to continue the collection of value added tax (VAT) and advised all Nigerians to pay their VAT to FIRS until the appellate court rules otherwise.\n\nThe Rivers State Government had last month secured a major court victory over the federal government in the collection of VAT in the state, and had gone ahead, along with Lagos State, to enact necessary laws and agencies for the collection of the tax.\n\nBut the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal on September 10 ordered all parties that had submitted themselves before the court to maintain status quo ante bellum pending the hearing of an application seeking to stay the judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt.\n\nFollowing the Appeal Court ruling, the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN), became confused, and desperately called on the federal government to clear the confusion.\n\nApparently in reaction, the Minister of Finance, in a newspaper advertorial on Thursday, stated the position of the federal government on the rulings, directing the FIRS to continue the collection.\n\nThe minister stated: \u201cThe tax-paying public has been confused about whom to pay VAT to as a result of the Federal High Court\u2019s judgement in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020.\n\n\u201cThe Appeal Court\u2019s ruling, halting the execution of the judgement of the Federal High Court required all parties to maintain the status quo ante bellum. As such, FIRS shall continue to administer VAT in all the states of the federation unless the appellate court rules otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe ruling of the Court of Appeal, therefore, implores all taxpayers in all the states to continue to pay their VAT, and for the FIRS to continue to collect VAT on behalf of the government in compliance with the VAT Act.\n\nShe appealed to all parties to stop their litigations in the interest of the nation, stating that the economy had ominous challenges and needed the support of every Nigerian for it not to go under.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cThe uncertainty caused by the recent pronouncements of the Federal High Court, sitting in Rivers State and the subsequent enactment of Value Added Tax (VAT) laws by some states is unnecessary and very regrettable.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy, just as the economy of other nations, is facing serious challenges occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, \u201cGovernment is facing serious revenue challenges and, therefore, this is not the time for litigations, but for all hands to be on deck, to pull through this difficult period.\u201d\n\nThe ruling of the Court of Appeal, she said \u201chas provided the much needed certainty, clarity, and consistency that will enable compliance without disruption to business while final resolution is awaited.\u201d\n\nShe said the federal government \u201cshall continue to update the tax-paying public on this matter as the proceedings unfold at the appellate courts. All businesses are hereby encouraged to continue with their lawful operations.\u201d\n\nThe leaders of the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN), had on September 17, spoken in one voice, urging the federal government to make a statement that would clear the VAT confusion.\n\nThey said that the reality and consequences of the controversy \u201cportend grave danger for the business community and by extension, the fragile economic recovery the country had been witnessing in recent times.\u201d\n\nThe OPSN, which is comprised of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), and the Nigeria Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), the Nigeria Association of Small Scale Industries (NASSI) and the Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASMEs), said a statement from the federal government would give a clear direction to the business community.\n\nIt said it would also save them the dilemma of remitting their VAT to the wrong government that might necessitate double payment; it would also save them the consequence of paying penalty fees for withholding the remittance of their VAT beyond the due date of Tuesday, September 21, 2021.\n\nThe Chairman of the OPSN, Mr. Taiwo Adeniyi, said: \u201cWe want to pay the VAT. But it is for the government at the centre to make a pronouncement because we do not want the situation where we will pay the VAT to the FIRS and the court will later say that it is state governments that shall collect VAT. We are shouting that the government will give us a direction as to what to do. It is not even late as a pronouncement can be made on Tuesday, September 21.\n\nAdeniyi said that the OPSN was seriously concerned about the consequences of the ongoing controversy over the right of the government to collect VAT in the country, adding that it would be an \u201caberration to punish businesses or make them suffer from the proverbial \u2018two elephants fighting.\u201d\n\nHe said the situation had created an environment of uncertainty, which would negatively affect business competitiveness and sustainability in the country.\n\nThe federal government, through the FIRS by virtue of the Value Added Tax Act of 1993, has been the sole collecting authority of VAT in Nigeria until the Rivers State Government\u2019s court victory, which empowered it to collect VAT from businesses located in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Global supply disruptions aiding rise\n\nEmmanuel Addeh with agency report\n\nA bit of good news came in for the Dollar-strapped Nigerian economy yesterday with the price of Brent crude rising to three-year high amid supply constraints and a drop in crude inventories of the United States, the world\u2019s top oil consumer.\n\nThe global output disruptions forced energy companies to pull large amounts of crude out of inventories.\n\nThe rally was slightly dampened by China\u2019s first public sale of state crude reserves.\n\nBrent futures eventually sold at $78.09 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude sold at $73.98 yesterday evening.\n\nThat was the highest close for Brent since October 2018 and for WTI since July 2021, both for a second day in a row.\n\nIt was the third week of gains for Brent and the fifth for WTI mostly due to U.S. Gulf Coast output disruptions from Hurricane Ida in late August.\n\nU.S. oil refiners were hunting to replace Gulf crude, turning to Iraqi and Canadian oil, traders said.\n\nSome members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, known as OPEC, have struggled to raise output due to under-investment or maintenance delays during the pandemic.\n\nRussia said it would remain a reliable supplier of energy to global markets. But Russian gas giant, Gazprom, had been accused of doing too little to increase its natural gas supplies to Europe, where prices have soared.\n\nIran, which wants to export more oil, said it would return to talks on resuming compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal \u201cvery soon\u201d, but gave no specific date.\n\nEdward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said: \u201cExtra Iranian barrels of crude seem unlikely to be a 2021 story,\u201d noting negotiations \u201cwill be a long drawn-out process.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, drillers added 10 oil rigs this week, putting the oil and gas rig count up for a 14th month in a row.\n\nBrent could hit $80 by the end of September due to stock draws, lower OPEC production and stronger Middle East demand, UBS analysts said.\n\nAnalysts at UBS told Reuters that Brent oil price could hit $80 a barrel by the end of September due to stock draws, lower OPEC production and stronger demand in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhat still might allow Brent to hit that mark over the coming weeks is the ongoing drop in oil inventories driven by unplanned supply disruptions,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nMarket analysts added that surging natural gas prices were also attracting the rise as the supply shortage of gas could encourage power utilities to shift from gas to oil if winter turns out to be colder this year.\n\nThe rise in crude oil price means an increase in revenue for Nigeria but a headache for the country\u2019s subsidy shortfall payments.\n\nRecently, Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said the supply crisis affecting the natural gas market might push crude oil prices up by $10 a barrel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The way they are going, they can only help the PDP and governor Fintiri to win re-election in 2023\", a top party official stated.\n\nIncidentally, the current manipulation in Adamawa is going on at a time the general feeling in the state is that the governorship seat should rotate to another zone outside Adamawa Central in order to engender fairness and give a sense of belonging to all the geopolitical zones in the former Gongola State.\n\nAlthough the First Lady is rooting that the Central Zone has yet to produce a governor and believes it is the turn of the zone to do so in 2023, APC stakeholders are opposing her position on the grounds that her zone produced the post of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation since 2015.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the fact that Aisha being the First Lady of the Federation and coming from the Central Zone as well, the zone has had its own fair share of the power equation and should hands off the governorship seat for another zone in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nSimilarly, the Northern Senatorial Zone had produced a governor for a record six times and the feeling is that the zone had benefitted adequately.\n\n\"Such fairness can never be achieved if the congresses are manipulated against the wishes and aspirations of the people\", another party source added.\n\n\"Now, during the local government congresses, this was what happened. While the election of party officials of Yola-South, the home local government of Sen. Binani and Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, was held at the state secretariat of the party in Jimeta amid heavy security operatives as against the Yola South party secretariat, Sen. Bindow and Sen Abbo did not even know where the congresses of Mubi North and Mubi South, their home local governments, took place till date.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson of the First Lady, Aliyu Abdullahi, who said he is in New York, declined comment when contacted on the phone, he simply said \u201cPlease I have nothing to comment on that story.\u201d",

As winners, each of the startups gets \u20a6500,000 worth of TechCabal coverage.\n\n\u201cFor my team and I, winning at the pitching session validates our vision for the future of e-commerce in Africa, that is, conversational and social commerce,\u201d Ronald Tagoe, Founder of ChatBots Africa, told TechCabal. \u201cWe are very elated by this validation and look forward to an exciting future.\u201d\n\nBased in Kenya, ChatBots is a multi-channel bot platform that allows companies to use AI chatbots on WhatsApp. According to the company, the solution is built for all ranges of experiences; from the complete newbie to the advanced user.\n\nAccording to Tagoe, the startup won because the solution and business model were \u201cvery clear and the customers\u2019 pain point was something the judges gravitated towards.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor Wunmi Akinsola, CEO and founder of Fashtracker, winning the investment pitch session represents \u201ca major validation\u201d for the startup.\n\nNigeria-based Fashtracker connects trusted and sustainable African fashion brands to people within and outside the continent through its online platform. \u201cWe aim to be the go-to fashion destination within Africa, and globally, for African brands,\u201d a statement on the company\u2019s website reads.\n\n\u201cI feel super motivated to keep building Fashtracker,\u201d the elated founder said. \u201cThe fact that Techcabal, the investors, and other stakeholders involved bought into the idea from a 2-minute pitch is a major validation that is a necessary component for the success of any startup.\u201d\n\nAkinsola believes certain factors propelled the judges to select the startup as the winner; such as the fact that the African fashion marketplace is \u201crelatively untapped and is a huge opportunity\u201d considering the barriers to entry such as logistics, payments, and scale, are already being solved.\n\n\u201cThere are too many opportunities for scalable integrations including menswear, skincare, B2B, Saas, VAS, and this could all be on a Pan African/Global-scale if done right,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn addition, Akinsola notes that startups like Fashtracker have the capacity to alleviate thousands of creatives, and fashion entrepreneurs economically. \u201cEspecially during such tough times in Nigeria \u2013 economic prosperity is key.\u201d\n\nA screenshot of ChatBots Africa website.

          "title": "What will commerce look like in Africa over the next decade?",
          "text": "With Covid-19 restrictions forcing more people to shop online, e-commerce companies and platforms on the continent have enjoyed a surge in activity. Jumia, for instance, saw a significant uptick in major indicators in the second half of last year. Also, retailers that did not previously have an online presence were compelled to do so.\n\nThe pandemic essentially propelled widespread growth in African e-commerce. However, there are questions of whether that growth can be sustained in the long run. Juliet Anammah, Group Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairperson of Jumia Nigeria thinks it can.\n\n\u201cThe boom in e-commerce is not just a function of the pandemic,\u201d she says during a panel discussion at the ongoing TechCabal Future of Commerce conference. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to the fact that there\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s being solved \u2013 finding what you want, doing it much faster, getting more choices and best pricing online. If we can provide all of that, then consumers will always opt for that option.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs part of the major shifts expected in buying and selling in Africa, Anammah sees even more Africans shopping online over the next few years. This is provided e-commerce platforms continue to solve problems consumers face and offer more suites of offerings.\n\nTechnologies and innovations like Virtual Reality and interoperable payment systems are also expected to play an increased role in buying and selling, and broadly change consumer behavior and the way e-commerce is seen.\n\n\u201cStakeholders just need to keep ensuring that online platforms are solving problems. Nobody goes online just for the sake of it,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cAs long as stakeholders are building solutions that are solving fundamental problems, people will always go online.\u201d\n\nBuilding blocks for growth\n\nTo enable further growth in African commerce through digital channels, certain \u2018building blocks\u2019 must be in place. According to Nkebet Mesele, Senior Director for Solutions Management in sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, that entails making commerce in Africa \u201cmobile-led\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor commerce to grow across Africa, the building blocks that have to be in place are first, it has to be mobile-led. We need to shift commerce, banking, and the movement of money from what we know it as traditionally to building an end-to-end mobile experience for commerce to thrive,\u201d Mesele said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of SME intra-Africa money movement and trade that\u2019s happening. Hence we need to ensure cross-currency flows and commerce is happening seamlessly between a consumer in Nigeria, for example, and a merchant in Kenya.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those, SME support initiatives and adequate fraud controls also have to be in place. \u201cConsumers and the merchants have to be comfortable buying online and also have that understanding and awareness of how to be safe while shopping.\u201d\n\nKhadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s Head of Product Expansion notes that providing access to credit for merchants and SMEs is equally important to enabling further growth, as is exposing sellers to more consumers across the country, continent, or world.\n\n\u201cIf you can only exchange goods with people standing in front of you, then the scope of your market will always be limited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can stay at home and create something that someone halfway across the continent or the world is willing to pay for, then all of a sudden, you\u2019re exposed to a whole new level of growth.\u201d\n\nAbu adds that increased internet penetration and financial inclusion levels are key indicators for e-commerce as they would imply that people have money and can access sellers not just in their immediate vicinity but also across other markets or regions.\n\nMore so, efficient use of technology to automate businesses, incentives, and grants from the government or larger organisations and initiatives that include logistics and supply chain management will \u201cdefinitely help\u201d people build and produce more.\n\nWhile building, however, stakeholders have to \u201crealise that there\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution that makes sense for the entire continent,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations, at Chipper Cash cautions.\n\n\u201cAfrica is fragmented from a cultural perspective and because of that, people have different ways of doing things. So whatever solutions are built have to be contextually aware of the environment and be sensitive to the needs of individuals in the specific countries.\u201d\n\nIt might be possible to aggregate some of the market systems in these countries at some point, Jalakasi says. \u201cBut it starts with building solutions for people on the ground.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nYou can follow the Future of Commerce 2021 event on YouTube.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",
          "summary": "Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\nBut one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams.\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021.\nThat\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt all levels, education in Nigeria is in dire need of intervention. On the supply side, there are more students or prospective students than there are schools. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), about 10.5 million children in Nigeria between the ages of 5-14 are out of school, and one in every five out-of-school children in the world is in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a study of public and private schools in Lagos State by Elaine Unterhalter, a professor of education and international development at University College London, there are 1,200 primary school-aged children for every public school place available. With governments unable to provide adequate options for education in the country, individuals are picking up the slack.\n\nAccording to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are more private universities (99) than state and federal universities (98) combined. However, with about 40% of the population living in poverty, the fees charged by these private schools are out of reach for many people.\n\nYet, not everyone who can afford to pay for a university education gets the opportunity. Between 2010 and 2015, only 26% of the ten million applicants to Nigerian universities gained admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis situation has made room for tutorial centres that prepare students for university entrance examinations like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nSowing the seeds\n\nIn 2015, Jeremiah Godwin took the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination but did not make the required score to get admitted into the university. Having failed to get into school, he spent the next year at home. He discovered online marketing and, together with a friend, started reading about the subject.\n\nTheir first thought was to create a blog with hopes of making money from it. That never happened, but they were not discouraged. They kept on learning, and in 2017, Godwin\u2019s family relocated to the US, but he stayed in touch with his friend.\n\nTheir next venture was Boss Visuals, a digital agency that created logos for businesses while helping them market their products using social media. This time, they had some success making about $1,000 monthly.\n\nStarting Stranerd\n\nIn 2018, while hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop in the United States, Godwin talked with a girl. During the conversation, he discovered that she had some difficulties with calculus, a subject that he had aced as a student in Nigeria. He gave her some pointers on how to solve some problems.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from her saying that she was willing to pay whatever he wanted if he could tutor her to pass the course. He agreed, and she sent him a bunch of past questions.\n\nRealising he needed some help, he enlisted his friend, Timmy Salami, to solve the questions. Together, they were able to tutor the girl and made some money in the process.\n\nAt about the same time, Salami was trying to decide what to do, so he spoke to Godwin about tutoring students online. With guidance from Godwin, he created an Instagram page and started posting content. They named the page \u201cStranerd,\u201d a combination of the Italian word for extra and nerd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, they were getting requests from students worldwide who needed help with their assignments, charging between $20 and $50 to solve problems. With time, requests started extending beyond math and calculus to subjects they had no expertise on, and so they hired more tutors, in the process becoming a bridge between the students and the tutors.\n\nThe most significant change would come in 2020, when they started receiving more requests from students in Nigeria. These students could not afford what they charged their clients studying in European and American schools. But they wanted to help.\n\nFirst, they researched available edtech solutions in Nigeria, but none of the options they saw was good enough. They were either unknown to the students who needed them or did not serve the demographic that reached out to the Stranerd team.\n\nDiscovering a need, they launched a web platform that caters to Nigerians at an affordable price. Currently, they serve students on both the website and social media. On social media, they charge about $5 for each question they solve, sell study materials, and connect students to tutors while taking a cut of the earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranerd website. Source: Supplied\n\nOn the website, which currently serves mainly Nigerian students, the startup employs a coin system to charge students. Coins sell from $0.99 (\u20a6408) for 300 bronze coins to $4.99 (\u20a62,056) for 50 gold coins.\n\nWith these coins, students can ask questions, access study tools and materials, or book sessions with tutors. In addition to using the coins to pay for services on the site, students can also redeem coins by answering questions.\n\nGodwin explains the reason for employing the coin system as opposed to a subscription model.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that the average Nigerian is not okay with paying a monthly subscription for a product or service, so we use the coin to make them pay for services as they use them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nThe startup has big plans to extend its offerings beyond tutorials. The goal, Godwin says, is to become a one-stop-shop for the Nigerian student\u2019s educational needs and possibly African students also. They also want to include connecting students to internships as well as providing study-abroad services to students. But first, the startup plans to build trust among the students before leveraging it to add more services.\n\n\u201cBy next year [2022], we\u2019re hoping to get a million users. Right now, on the platform, we have questions and tutors. We\u2019re hoping to bring in study groups and sessions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when the tutors come on the site, they create study materials that students can access whenever they like. The big vision is to become a company that the Nigerian student can trust with everything educational.\u201d\n\nStranerd also plans to add classes. Already the startup has partnered with two tutorial centres in Lagos with plans to add more in the future. For these tutorial centres whose reach is limited by physical classes, the value proposition is their ability to reach many more students than would typically walk in.\n\n\u201cWith classes, tutors can host their classes, maybe JAMB or JUPEB classes, and they can have students subscribe to the class, and they can teach them. We have already partnered with two in the Akoka area. And in the coming months, as we push more features to the site, we would partner with more people around Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSince launching in 2019, the startup has served almost 40,000 students in 11 countries, including Nigeria, United States, India, Pakistan, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe website, which has run solely on revenue, already has 500 students after its August 2021 launch.\n\nGodwin reveals that the startup made a little over $2,000 in revenue in 2019 after launching towards the end of the year.\n\nIn 2020, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup reportedly generated $30,000 in revenue and has already done over $40,000 so far in 2021. It also has plans to raise money from investors having already applied to Y Combinator. Users can also expect an app release soon.\n\nGodwin is studying Computer Information Systems at Near East University, Cyprus, while Salami is studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. As students, running a business has been a bit challenging, and Godwin reveals that the biggest test, so far, has been adequately understanding the Nigerian market. The second biggest challenge has been funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is an issue. We\u2019re not so much, and with money, you can hire more people to speed up the work.

And according to the United Nations, September 23 every year is an opportunity to support and protect the linguistic identity and cultural diversity of all deaf people and other sign language users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) estimates that there are more than 70 million deaf people worldwide and more than 80% of them are from developing countries.\n\nHow do people with hearing impairments communicate? Depending on the degree of severity, they use hearing aids, speech-to-text tools and sign languages to communicate.\n\nBefore yesterday, I thought there was just one universal sign language that every deaf person understood.\n\nHowever, studies show that there are over 300 sign languages in the world, and over 23 of them are used in Africa.\n\nInterestingly, technology is assisting people in Africa who have varying degrees of hearing loss.\n\nTo know how, please, read: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nOr watch the video: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nReelFruit raises $3 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s dried fruit snack brand, ReelFruit, has announced a $3 million Series A round to expand production, increase product offerings, and double down on exports to the US and other international markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlitheia IDF led the round with $2m. Samata Capital and Flying Doctor Healthcare Investment Company also participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Affiong Williams (CEO), ReelFruit is an agritech company that processes and distributes locally grown fruits. It claims to help communities by empowering fruit farmers by purchasing their raw materials.\n\nMore on its expansion plans, ReelFruit plans to build a new factory in Ogun State, Nigeria, to increase its monthly dried fruit production from 6 to 30 tonnes.\n\nIn its first year, the factory will employ over 200 people. With a larger supply of dried fruit, ReelFruit will develop new products for domestic and international markets.\n\nBy December 2021, the company plans to launch an eCommerce channel for direct US sales and open up more B2B opportunities, such as white-labelling and co-packing, to support the national drive toward import substitution.\n\nThe company believes local buyers will purchase dried fruit locally, reducing their reliance on imports.\n\nPaystack launches Apple Pay to help Nigerian businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaystack, an African fintech company that powers and processes payments for businesses, announced yesterday that Pay with Apple Pay is now available on its platform.\n\nWhat does this mean? Nigerian businesses will have access to millions of Apple Pay users across more than 60 countries where the payments service is available. And according to Paystack, it is the \u201cfastest, secure way for Nigerian businesses to accept international payments.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2014, Apple Pay, Apple\u2019s mobile payments and digital wallet service, allows users to pay securely and privately on their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macbooks.\n\nHow will it work? When a customer with Apple Pay buys from a Paystack merchant, they will see the option to checkout using Pay with Apple Pay. They can then proceed to pay using Touch ID or Face ID.\n\nThey can accept payments made through any of the Paystack-hosted commerce tools \u2014 Paystack Storefronts or Invoices \u2014 and through a variety of payment channels such as cards, mobile money, USSD, QR codes, and EFT.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. Flutterwave, an African payments company, integrated PayPal into its platform in March 2021, allowing PayPal customers worldwide to pay African merchants via its \u201cPay with PayPal\u201d feature.\n\nNow is an excellent moment to read this: Nigerians, other African merchants can now accept PayPal via Flutterwave partnership\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy Africa must be independent on healthcare support \u2013 AfDB President.

          "title": "What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had much contact with deaf people. Of course, that is to be expected as I didn\u2019t know any deaf people.\n\nIn later years, I would come to \u2014 unconsciously \u2014 associate being deaf with being poor. Why? I only saw deaf people while travelling through Nigerian roads to or from school or during village visits to see my grandparents.\n\nThey had on old clothes and would constantly thrust or \u2014 if the paper was too big \u2014 display a note asking you to give some money to the deaf people or an orphanage or a motherless baby\u2019s home. Interestingly, they were always smiling, and I always wondered why.\n\nDuring the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, I had to reconfigure my perceptions when I met a young girl who we will call Mary. Big brown eyes, small \u2014 at least for a five-year-old her \u2014 funny, smart, beautiful, silent \u2014 at first \u2014 deaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I interacted with her, a lot of my misconceptions began to fall away. Poor? Nope. Beggar? Nope. Because she\u2019s hard of hearing, you have to speak really loud or use signs so she can understand.\n\nBut, I got really incensed after learning that her parents refused to acknowledge her deafness. They put her in a regular school with no access to sign language classes to help her communicate.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t entirely deaf, like Mary, basic technology like a hearing aid or an implant would make it easier to communicate and understand people.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of Sign Languages we talked to members of the deaf community. You can choose to watch the video or read down, or both. Happy International Day of Sign Language. #WeSignForHumanRights\n\nNigeria\u2019s deaf community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\n\nAccording to Oluwaseun Sosanya, a sign language interpreter, tutor, and deaf advocate, the deaf community \u201cis a collection of people that share the same idea, belief, and culture, and use sign language to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe community includes the two categories of deaf \u2014 pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf \u2014 parents of the deaf, sign language interpreters, and all users of sign language.\n\n\u201cPre-lingual deaf are people born naturally deaf, who\u2019ve spoken no language. And the post-lingual deaf are people who were once talking and hearing but later became deaf as a result of illness or accident.\u201d\n\nUsing Sosanya\u2019s explanation, Mary is a pre-lingual deaf person.\n\nBut beyond this is the rich history and culture of the deaf people and those who have accepted and are proud of this identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaoluwa Bayonle, another sign language interpreter, says, \u201cIt is a community of people, I mean the deaf people and hard of hearing people, who have accepted their deafness, their inability to hear, and are proud of this identity. The community is established with a different culture from the hearing community.\n\n\u201cThe members of this community are the deaf people, the hard of hearing, the sign language users, and the friends of the deaf. The official language of this community is sign language.\u201d\n\nSign language is a huge part of the deaf community culture. It is the unique way in which the deaf and friends of the deaf communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\nFor the African deaf community, the prevalent sign language is the American Sign Language (ASL) which Andrew Foster \u2014 regarded as the Father of Deaf Education in Africa \u2014 brought into the continent.\n\nHe would go on to found West Africa\u2019s first School for the Deaf in Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s first, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHowever, many African countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Mali have created their own sign languages. Nigeria does have a sign language, but it is not officially recognised and as widely used as the ASL.\n\nInterestingly, there are currently over 300 recognised variations of sign language.\n\nOne thing I noticed is how accommodating and welcoming members of the community are. A fact which Seun Dosunmu, a disability inclusion advocate, echoes when he says, \u201cThe deaf community, the deaf persons majorly, are very accommodating and always willing to engage and participate in activities, especially when they are invited.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they face a lot of stigmatisation and rarely is provision made for their inclusion.\n\n\u201cMany people do not consider inclusion, so they don\u2019t make interpreters available. And this is the major reason why there is a gap, and there is marginalisation as we have it.\u201d\n\nA tale of signs and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\nMary\u2019s parents believe her hearing issues stem from a spiritual problem and take her for deliverance sessions, hoping to drive away the demon of deafness.\n\nThis is very common in the African setting, where many people view deaf people as sick, retarded, or demon-possessed.\n\nAs Treasures Uchegbu, Convener and CEO SpeakingFingers, says while talking about the challenges deaf people face, \u201cCommunication/Information, attitudinal (words and behaviours) barriers which I refer to as the cancer of all challenges \u2014 referring to the deaf as dumb. Then that one about putting a leaf in the mouth which could be perceived as calling them goats.\n\n\u201cOr an average primary four child whom I asked \u2018Who are the users of sign language?\u2019 In response, he said, \u2018mumu people!!!\u2019 I\u2019m sure he got that from his immediate environment. So I ask if this young boy grows into a policymaker, will he make policies to cover \u2018mumu people?\u2019 Of course not.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Nigerian Federal Government passed the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act into law. The Act established the National Commission of Persons with Disabilities and includes several provisions such as accessibility aids in public places and better inclusion of the disabled in workplaces, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\nHowever, the curve is pretty steep. According to a 2018 study by Emmanuel Ihenchi Asonye and two others, about 23% of Nigeria\u2019s population are deaf people. Most of that number live below the poverty line, with little to no access to healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAnd as Douglas Izuchukwu, President of the National Association of Deaf Students, says, \u201cthe biggest challenge, communication barrier.\u201d\n\nDosunmu recalls having to intervene in the case of a deaf person who had been living with tuberculosis for a while. After taking him to a specialist hospital, they faced another challenge, none of the doctors or nurses understood sign language, and there was no interpreter.\n\nThis inability to communicate is a common occurrence, leading to either an untreated patient or a wrong diagnosis. Thankfully, they were able to get an interpreter in time.\n\nIn so many ways, the capacity to communicate is hindered, and a lot of the time, privacy is compromised on the hill of interpretation.\n\nFor the hearing community, technology enhances communication. Social media networks like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord serve to bring people together.\n\nA lot of this tech is mainly geared towards what the hearing community needs, with little to no thought, if any, for the needs of deaf people. Some, like the live-audio craze which began with Clubhouse, do not even have any provisions for them.\n\nBut, in some ways, technology is trying to bridge the communication gap.\n\nCommunicating in a tech-enabled world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nAccording to Izuchukwu, \u201cTechnology is now doing well, trying. On YouTube, we have automatic captions, time to control the captions, and time to control how the speakers speak. That is what technology is doing. And again, Google Meet too has automatic captioning.\u201d\n\nBut he wants technology to do more.\n\n\u201cFor example, on WhatsApp, when someone sends voice notes, there should be a place on WhatsApp where one can click to turn on automatic captions, for deaf people to read and benefit. Same way it is on YouTube, I wish WhatsApp too has the feature. And the feature applies to other applications like Zoom and others.\u201d\n\nIzuchuwku, speaking from the perspective of a deaf person, really just wants inclusion.\n\nAnd technology has already done so much.\n\n1. The use of social media to spread awareness and advocate for more inclusion.\n\n2. Assistive technology like Speech-to-Text, which helps translation from spoken words into text.\n\n3. Hearing aids and cochlear implants, which enable deaf or hard of hearing people retain some part of all parts of their hearing ability.\n\n4. Mobile apps that provide sign language tutoring for beginners, such as the ASL American Sign Language and the Ghanian Sign Language app.\n\n5. Automatic captions on YouTube and Google Meet, which use artificial intelligence to automatically transmit what is being said during webinars or in online videos.\n\nThere have also been technology mishaps, such as the sign language hand glove that translates sign language into words. The deaf community believed it to be more accommodating of the hearing community without regard to the deaf people \u2014 who it was purporting to help.\n\nAlso, assistive technology like Speech-to-Text and automatic captioning have limits as they do not always provide an accurate translation, which is doubly worse in the African scenario.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Funmi Ogunro, Head of School, Friends of the Deaf Academy, says they had to move the school online, using WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Eventually, they received support from Gradely, a personalised e-learning platform for 300 students.\n\nDosunmu suggests that more people learn sign language or at the very least make more interpreters available in public places such as banks, hospitals, courts, etc. Some apps help people learn sign language on both Android and iOS stores. Although, there seems to be a dearth of Nigerian made or focused apps.\n\nHowever, despite technological advancements, deaf people still face discrimination and exclusion, especially regarding information. Dosunmu says that most deaf persons have little to no access to computers and do not even have smartphones. How then do they access the technology?\n\nInternational Day of Sign Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sign for human rights\n\nThe International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually on September 23 as part of the International Week of Deaf People.\n\nThis year, the World Federation of the Deaf has given daily themes for the Week \u2014 Monday, September 20 to Sunday, September 26.\n\nMonday: Cherishing Deaf History\n\nTuesday: Sustainable Deaf Leadership\n\nWednesday: Sign Languages for All Deaf Learners\n\nThursday: We Sign For Human Rights\n\nFriday: Intersectional Deaf Communities\n\nSaturday: Deaf Culture and Arts\n\nSunday: Human Rights in Times of Crisis\n\nEach theme represents an important topic in the deaf community, with inclusion as the central theme.\n\nBeyond their disabilities, deaf people are human beings who have rights \u2014 the right to fair treatment, employment, and the right to inclusion.\n\nWhat\u2019s common to Ludwig van Beethoven, Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Foster.\n\nDeafness and partial or complete hearing loss. But there\u2019s more. Despite their disability, considered a hindrance by many, they accomplished remarkable things.\n\nAnd Opeoluwa Sotonwa \u2014 a deaf Nigerian American attorney, disability rights advocate, and literary writer \u2014 has borrowed a leaf from these greats.\n\nBeing deaf is not a curse. The deaf should not be segregated. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel stupid or unworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaking Fingers Network\n\nNGOs like Friends of the Deaf Foundation, Collaboration of Deaf and Hearing Adults (CODAH) Enterprise, and Speaking Fingers Network provide helpful resources like free hearing aids, including persons with disabilities in their programmes, build inclusive private schools, and provide life skills to support learning and development.\n\nHowever, in the search for inclusion, we all have a part to play. Among other things, we can design sign language learning apps, inclusive audio/video with subtitling and automatic captioning. It can, and should, be done.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Newly opened lawsuits in London and New York have shed light on how bribe that trading firms paid agents to win oil contracts from Nigeria\u2019s state oil company may have raised funds for the country\u2019s past two elections in 2015 and 2019.\n\nAn ex-British Petroleum Plc, BP oil trader alleged this week that cargo allocations by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. could have contributed to preparations for general elections in 2019, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAnd a former Glencore Plc employee in July admitted paying a middleman $300,000 to secure a crude shipment from the NNPC, understanding the money would be spent on the nationwide vote that took place four years earlier.\n\nA spokesman for the NNPC didn\u2019t respond to three calls and three text messages seeking comment.\n\nJonathan Zarembok, who left BP\u2019s West Africa desk last year, said in the suit he suspected that fees paid by the U.K. energy giant to obtain NNPC contracts would go toward the 2019 elections.\n\nHe filed an employment claim against BP, alleging he was fired for raising concerns about the large sums being transferred to intermediaries to win business in Nigeria.\n\nZarembok said in a witness statement made public this month that emails sent in 2017 by a BP executive in Nigeria were a \u201cclear red flag\u201d and implied \u201cthere would be pressure to pay bribes.\u201d\n\nThe emails discussed how preparations for elections would get under way in 2018. \u201cWe understand what that means,\u201d the executive wrote.\n\nThe company then wired $900,000 in fees to a local agent after securing two oil cargoes from NNPC, he said.\n\n\u201cBP is defending in full and denies all allegations made by the claimant,\u201d the company said in a statement.

He then had Glencore wire $300,000 to an intermediary company, which prosecutors said was used \u201cto pay bribes to Nigerian government officials.\u201d\n\nRead also: How NNPC manicured its books to extract N287bn profit\n\nU.S. prosecutors outlined how Stimler and others paid bribes worth millions of dollars in several countries, including to NNPC officials, between 2007 and 2018. A Glencore spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe conduct described in the plea is unacceptable and has no place in Glencore,\u201d the company said in a statement on July 26.\n\nBloomberg has previously reported that the unnamed \u201cForeign Official 1\u201d refers to Diezani Alison-Madueke, who served as Nigeria\u2019s oil minister and oversaw NNPC between 2010 and 2015.

          "text": "Women have from time past been directly or indirectly involved in supporting their families and communities through entrepreneurial activities especially through farming and the processing of farm products, fishing, textile production, and trading in markets, thereby contributing to household incomes and growth of national economies. Even with all the historical success, women still make the majority of players in the micro, small and quasi-micro business sectors. This is because adequate attention and the allocation of resources towards supporting women\u2019s entrepreneurship endeavors is still minimal when compared to their counterparts. The continuous failure to pay attention to women\u2019s economic activities is both a moral and economic injustice as improving access to entrepreneurial opportunities is a major requirement for any community to achieve greater levels of economic growth and development. Improving issues around gender equality will significantly improve the conditions of economic development.\n\nAccording to data from the Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex \u2013 Klapper, L.2014) database, women represent the greatest portion of the population with marginal or without access to capital. If we are ever going to be able to attain gender equality, then the issues of equity of opportunities at all levels of society and the economy must be addressed. Nigeria has among the largest numbers of female entrepreneurs around the world, with a lot more expressing their desires to launch their businesses, yet they remain minimally funded in the entrepreneurship space which is a key driver of growth in our society.\n\nPublic and private investors around the world have recognized the value of investing in women. Investing in women is not just a moral and social decision but is simply smart investing. Every investor wants to invest their time and resources in a good investment, and that is exactly what most female entrepreneurs are. It, therefore, makes economic, financial, and business sense to ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the same opportunities for success as their male counterparts.\n\nRead also: Lagos leveraging tech to transform businesses Sanwo-Olu\n\nIt has become important that gender requirements are mainstreamed into the design of policies and initiatives aimed at supporting women entrepreneurs, it is way more than creating random opportunities. Instruments aimed at improving the technical and financial capacities of women entrepreneurs must be designed through a gender lens to boost the development of female entrepreneurs while equipping them with tools and resources to grow their enterprises. The covid-19 pandemic has presented a unique opportunity in its recovery to redesign and restructure our economic transformation by promoting inclusive economies. Before the pandemic, women already had significantly fewer economic and entrepreneurship opportunities than men \u2013 research has shown that $1 trillion could be lost from global growth if women are not supported back into the workforce.\n\nWomen represent a growth market bigger than China and India combined, and the world must take advantage of it. With the growing population and increasing lack of jobs in Nigeria, we must put our full weight behind supporting female entrepreneurs. We therefore must continue to advocate for the allocation of more capital to initiatives that support female entrepreneurs and most especially the female entrepreneurs themselves who require capital to start, grow and scale their enterprises. This advocacy will also ensure that investors are aware of the numerous benefits of channeling funds into female-led businesses. Investors and funders must invest in the right projects and people that advance women\u2019s economic empowerment and that means that more deals and investments must meet as many of the 2x investment criteria as possible. These criteria are:\n\n\u2022 Whether a business is a majority-owned by women or founded by a woman\n\n\u2022 The share of women in senior management or on the board\n\n\u2022 The share of women in the workforce\n\n\u2022 Whether a product or service specifically or disproportionately benefits women\n\n\u2022 If a certain percent of loan proceeds in a deal through financial intermediaries supports women.\n\nWith this, more capital will shift towards investments that empower women in Africa to access entrepreneurship and leadership opportunities, as well as products and services that enhance their economic participation. scaling up the amount of financing available to support female entrepreneurs will not just improve overall profitability but will also help to overcome barriers, biases, and gaps that exist. Investors should begin to treat investment in female entrepreneurs and improvement of market opportunities for female investors as opportunities to be seized owing to their economic benefits.\n\nThe global community must renew its attention to women\u2019s economic empowerment in developing countries and increase investments in women, especially in Nigeria, because we have the numbers in terms of female entrepreneurs and the population of market reach. Improving financial support for female entrepreneurs would enable the expansion of old businesses and increase the number of new businesses, which in turn, would boost economic activities leading to increased innovation, productivity, and growth.\n\nLet\u2019s get smart with investing!\n\nWeyinmi Eribo is a trained geologist with Quality health safety and environment (QHSE) expertise, an enterprise development consultant, and a gender advisor with several years of experience across the oil and gas industry, extractive sector, health and safety, not-for-profit management, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\nWeyinmie is an entrepreneur and founder of Wevvo Nigeria, a resource and community-based platform that supports single female breadwinners by providing access to finance, enterprise development, mentoring and a community to thrive.\n\nWeyinmie is a StartingBloc social innovation fellow and Regional Chair, West Africa Alumni, a World Bank Scholar and a Cherie Blair Foundation Mentee Alumni. She is also an Alumni of the Enterprise Development Centre, with a certificate in Non-profit leadership and management from Lagos Business School.\n\nShe is a member of the Ministerial Focal group for the establishment of the National Youth Investment Fund and a contributor for BusinessDay Weekender where she writes on issues bordering gender inclusiveness.\n\nHer goal is to leverage her experience in providing value on projects and ensuring sustainability for interventions, particularly those that create jobs and stimulate business opportunities that can alleviate poverty in disadvantaged communities with special focus on women.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nI preferred EndPoliceBrutality to EndSARS for certain reasons. I knew from experience that almost all units and cadre of officers were abusers and felt that focusing on a section won\u2019t deal with the matter. Nevertheless, that struggle is needed as they are all officers. I also preferred a different approach to tackling Police Brutality to Protest Marches because of precedents. My priority was safety which I knew this government couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t provide. I can only willingly die for a country that values me and when I am sure that my death will yield desired change. In the absence of that, I do my best while ALIVE.\n\nI have witnessed too many incidents of police victimization that I had to teach myself restraint and patience. For rape survivors, I had to institutionalize escort services because the police can never be fully trusted to adhere to professional standards of operation. This poor work ethics of police officers is systemic issue and it is why it has become recurring subject.\n\nYes, we sometimes read the gory stories but in truth, Police Officers on a daily basis simply do not do their jobs. They just don\u2019t assimilate the fact that they are paid to do the job but rather exhibit a stupid ego of them doing citizens favours by showing up at their place of work. Trainings help a little but many of them jettison trainings because they know that their system is designed to cover their crimes. This fuels impunity and make them do and undo.\n\nFew days ago, I saw news about a young man killed by police officers in Benin-City. Yesterday night, I read report of the Soldier who assaulted an NYSC Corp member. This morning, I read about the murder of a young man by police officers in Uyo. There are many more \u2026\n\nI took time during the #EndSARS Protest to read reports of Police victimization. I also tried to follow up with stories that were presented in the various judicial panels of inquiry. Sadly and unfortunately, I still read similar reports till date The multi-hydra monster is still with us and we are yet to adequately strategize how to deal with it. It is good that we have identified this monster (Police Brutality), we however now know that it is actually \u2013 Law Enforcement Officers Brutality \u2013 as it is not limited to Police alone.\n\nWe can argue that ordinary citizens of this country are wicked to one another and use that as inference to the inhumane behaviour of our law enforcement officers. However, the officers OWE us more. These officers owe us respect, and professional discharge of duties. That uniform they wear should make them to be accountable as the uniform is symbolic. The Police is to protect lives and properties but our officers do opposite of their mandates.\n\nHow can a lawless officer enforce law?\n\nHow can an inhumane officer protect citizens?\n\nHow can irresponsible officers take responsibility for their actions and inactions?\n\nHow can corrupt officers be accountable?\n\nHow do we change a criminal justice system that institutionalize injustice and structurally promote impunity of criminal actions ?\n\nEquality brings Development which in turn brings PEACE.\n\n______________________\n\nPriscilla Usiobaifo is the Executive Director of BraveHeart Initiative (BHI), Igarra, Edo State.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has said his administration has trained over 11,365 teachers in the state since the introduction of Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) in 2018, deploying digital teaching tools to provide functional basic education to Edo children.\n\nObaseki said this at the 29th annual International Conference of the Association of Vocational Education of Nigeria (AVTEN), held at the University of Benin (UNIBEN).\n\nThe governor noted that his administration\u2019s sustained investment in basic education is hinged on its role at boosting technical and vocational training.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe basis for a solid technical and vocational education is quality basic education because without ensuring that our children have the right foundational skills, both literacy and life skills, they cannot grow independently.\n\n\u201cWithout that foundation, you cannot build a solid technical and vocational education. So, since 2018, we commenced the revamping of the state\u2019s basic education through our EDOBEST programme. We are proud of our achievements in this regard.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted: \u201cWe have renovated and constructed over 400 primary schools, improved teaching and learning in about 814 primary schools and trained 11,365 teachers, while over 246,731 children have benefited from our reforms in our basic education system.\n\n\u201cWe realize that if children are going to get quality education at a foundational stage, then you must focus on the teachers. Under EDOBEST, we have built the capacity of our teachers and our head teachers through the use of technology.\n\n\u201cWe made sure that learning materials were available to our children. Over the last three years, we have produced more than 8.5 millions textbooks and learning materials for these children. We have also built the capacity of our educational managers.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have also launched EDOBEST 2.0 because we have seen that in three to four years, we have moved children from primary one to six.\n\n\u201cWe have also realized that the junior school is where the child is defined. We want to make sure that they get vocational and technical skills. We have been able to train about 160,000 young men and women in various programmes through our skills development agency, EdoJobs.\n\n\u201cWe have enjoyed a lot of local and international partners including the Bank of Industry. One of the most recent projects which we are very excited about is the Edo technology skills campus. Under this arrangement, our goal is to make sure that over the next three to five years, we train a minimum of 10,000 people in software engineering in Edo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the establishment of a Federal Technical College of Education in South-South to train technical teachers, which is to be sited in Edo.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has justified President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s borrowings, insisting that the various loans including the foreign debt that it is taking are not for funding recurrent expenditures or pay salaries, but for implementing capital projects which the previous administrations failed to execute.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, made the claim in Maiduguri, Borno State, during a one-day town hall meeting on the power situation in the state, amid criticisms against the government\u2019s constant resort to borrowing.\n\nFormer president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, had, for instance, berated the Buhari government last week over its accumulation of debt, with the country\u2019s debt profile now in excess of N35trn, saying that it irresponsible to borrow to fund recurrent expenditure and to accumulate debt for future generation.\n\nThe criticisms came particularly in the light of last week\u2019s request by Buhari for another external loan to the Senate.\n\nIn his letter transmitted to the Senate, he sought the approval of the lawmakers to borrow $4 billion and \u20ac710 million loans from bilateral and multilateral organisations to fund the deficit in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe National Assembly had earlier in July approved the President\u2019s request to borrow $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans contained in the initial 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\nHowever, while defending the frequent request for loans, Mohammed said that the federal government has implemented a lot of projects in different parts of the country which he claimed the previous administrations had used as a conduit pipe to squander public funds.\n\nHe said the critics were members of previous administrations who performed badly in terms of modernising the country\u2019s infrastructure, even when they served at a time when earnings were multiples of what is obtainable today.\n\nThe minister pointed out that infrastructure is the engine of economic growth, hence, the premium it places on building and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cNaysayers have recently ramped up their criticism of the Buhari administration from borrowing. These critics are very insincere; we do not borrow for recurrent expenditure neither do we borrow to pay salaries. We are borrowing to build world-class infrastructures that will benefit generations of Nigerians and we have a lot to show from the loans we have taken,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister noted that the Federal Government has over 13,000 kilometres of federal roads under repair, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a road project in every state today. Today we have started the countdown to when the second Niger bridge which successive administrations have built only on paper will be completed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is an irony that those who are criticizing us today performed very badly in terms of modernizing our infrastructure even when they served at a time when our earnings were multiples of what we get today. Have they embarked on the kind of infrastructure development we are currently engaged in perhaps there would have been no reason for us to borrow as much as we are doing today.\n\n\u201cFor example, in their time they claimed to have spent billions of naira in building infrastructure but as one can see their infrastructure projects are only on the pages of newspapers. Today we are still saddled with looking for resources to build the same infrastructure for which they claimed to have allocated huge resources. We\u2019ll however not be deterred by their antics, we\u2019ll continue to ignore those who have decided to play politics with everything,\u201d Mohammed added.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to the developed world and multinational institutions to consider debt restructuring and even outright cancellation for developing countries impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBuhari who made the appeal while delivering his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, noted that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n\u201c\u2026there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u201d\n\nBelow is Buhari\u2019s\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Speech at the General Debate of the 76th Session of United Nations General Assembly Friday, September 24, in New York, USA\n\nProtocols:\n\nMr. President,\n\nLet me, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.\n\n2. I would like to commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3. Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.\n\n4. I also want to express my gratitude to him for re-appointing Ms. Amina Mohammed, as the Deputy Secretary General to assist him in discharging his heavy responsibilities.\n\nMr. President,\n\n5. The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\n\n6. In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order.\n\nMr. President,\n\n7. I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to COVID-19. The solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.\n\n8. On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.\n\n9. At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n10. Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospitals wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n11. In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\n12. Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n13. Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nMr President,\n\n14. Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n15. It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nMr. President,\n\n16. We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n17. There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n18 In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\nMr President,\n\n19. Nigeria is fully committed to nuclear non-proliferation and has always supported the view that it should involve all States.\n\n20. Disarmament Conventions deserve the support of all states, small, large, nuclear or non-nuclear. Nuclear weapons remain the ultimate agents of mass destruction, and their total elimination should be the final objective of all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.\n\n21. In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n22. Nigeria regards these upcoming events as important steps towards the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic efforts in this direction. We hope that the upcoming NPT review conference would lead to a successful outcome that would facilitate the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\n23. Terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets. Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n24. Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n25. I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved, we also know how important peace keeping is for those in vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond.\n\nMr. President,\n\n26. The impact of climate change is already with us in Nigeria, manifesting in various ways: conflicts trigger; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.\n\n27. In the circumstances, we intend to build a climate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\n\n28. As leaders, we must create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\n29. Nigeria believes that protecting our planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to our collective survival. That is why, we are working on a transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n30. Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n31. Similarly, corruption across national borders has huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries.\n\n32. It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations.\n\n33. I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by supporting the recommendations for systemic reforms made by the FACTI Panel.\n\n34. We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the United Nations Economic and Social Council to systematically monitor illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nMr. President,\n\n35. On the issue of debt, we have seen that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n36. I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n37. Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nMr. President,\n\n38. Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n39. My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n40. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\n\n41. We, therefore, call for a reform agenda that will engender better recovery from this crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n42. The global food system has, in recent times, been impacted by several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n43. Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected food access and supply, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and unpredictable shocks, such as the current global pandemic, further exacerbate vulnerabilities in the global food system, requiring the UN\u2019s urgent attention.\n\n44. The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and markets, sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices.\n\n45. At the heart of Nigeria\u2019s post-COVID-19 response is the Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.\n\n46. An integral part of our food systems\u2019 transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.\n\n47. Global efforts to mitigate and sustain food systems must involve key stakeholders, including Governments, farmers, investors, multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations.\n\nMr. President,\n\n48. Nigeria has been steadfast in safeguarding human rights, including the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand.\n\n49. In this context Nigeria calls for collective global action through a Treaty to end all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages.\n\n50. Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious decade-long onslaught by terrorists against Nigerians, quite contrary to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.\n\n51. The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.\n\n52. We are beginning to forget our affirmation of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.\n\n53. Nigeria has long been a principled fighter against racism and all forms of discrimination inspired by its African experience. In the past, racism oiled the machine of slavery and colonialism. Today, racism drives hate crimes and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.\n\n54. Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2nd August 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices.\n\nMr. President,\n\n55. No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation. The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration. It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our Organization is called to question. We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.\n\nMr. President,\n\n56. Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the Palestinian people. The situation in the Middle East is long-standing and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.\n\nMr President,\n\n57. Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms that are protective of us all. We need to re-commit to it, rejuvenate it to better serve us. Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all Member-States for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these, is dependent on how we assist each other to get COVID-19 out of all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.\n\n58. In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.\n\nI thank you.",

          "text": "By Okey Onyenweaku\n\nAce banker and Group Managing Director of FBN Holdings, Urum Kalu Eke (UK Eke), has emerged winner of the prestigious Zik Prize in Professional Leadership Award for the year 2020 in recognition of his strides in the banking industry.\n\nAnnouncing the choice of Eke for the award at a virtual press conference yesterday, Prof Pat Utomi, chairman of the selection committee and member of the Board of Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), organisers of the award scheme, said he was after a rigorous review process by the board.\n\nUtomi described Eke as a consummate banker with close to 4 decades experience in Financial Services, Audit and Capital Market operations across various financial institutions, who is credited with helping develop First Bank businesses within the Public Sector, Retail and Private Banking Groups.\n\n\u201cHe is being celebrated for his unblemished record of service and enormous contributions to the development and growth of the African Financial services industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAn honour to whom it is due\n\nUtomi said Eke, 56, who has had nearly four decades in the banking industry, and continues to make tremendous impact, especially in his capacity as Managing Director of FBN Holdings, where he has led the institution on the part of profitability, is one of Africa\u2019s finest bankers whose records speak for \u201cso eloquently.\u201d\n\nUtomi\u2019s views are shared by many industry players who told Business Hallmark that the honour to banker is most deserving.\n\n\u201cIt is a very good choice and an honour well deserved. It is a recognition of professional excellence,\u201d said Mazi Okechukwu Unaegbu, author and former president of Chattered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cU. K Eke has done well as a banker. And as GMD of FBN Holding\u2019s, he has made his mark. Those who made the choice did a very good job. Rather than look for politicians who carry money about, they decided to honour someone who has contributed meaningfully to the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. David Adonri, Chief Executive Officer of Highcap Securities, no one else could have been more worthy of such recognition.\n\n\u201cUK Ekeh has done well. I remember at the time he took office, the bank faced very serious challenges, principal of which was the position of the non-performing loan which had set the bank on the part of losses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs there were statutory provisions that had to be made, the losses that accompanied this were such that the bank could not pay dividends. In fact, within that season, the dividends that the FirstBankGroup was barely able to pay to shareholders were not coming from the bank but the subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cIt is to his credit that he has been able to complete the management of those provisions for the bad loans exposure due to the overexposure of the bank to, most notably the petroleum industry. He has successfully written off those bad debts.\u201d\n\nEke who spent about 19 years in the defunct Diamond Bank Plc where he rose to the position of Executive Director, seeing to the bank\u2019s rapid growth to emerge one of the leading banks in the country within the period, eventually left for First Bank to serve as Executive Director, Public Sector, South before moving up to become the Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings Plc in January 2016.\n\nAt FBN Holdings, he has continued to prove his mettle. While the holding company had ended 2015 with gross earnings of N503 billion, it moved to N583.006billion in 2016, his first year as MD.\n\nGoing further, it was N598.184billion in 2017, and by 2018, it was N587.406billion and then N590.4 in 2019. In 2020, however, the impact of the pandemic caused a marginal 1.9 percent drop in the earnings to N579.4 billion.\n\nIn terms of profit, Eke\u2019s reign has also coincided with a period of rapid growth. FBN Holdings profit grew from N12.24billion in 2016 to N37.7billion in 2017, N58.23billion in 2018, N73.66billion in 2019 and N89.7 billion in 2020.",

          "text": "In spite of mounting security challenges in Africa and the high hopes many African governments had that the election of Joseph Biden as president of the United States of America would lead to a marked improvement in relations with the US after four years of President Donald Trump, who basically ignored the continent.\n\nIn the eight months since Biden has been president, as a mark of his administration\u2019s top priorities, Antony Blinken, the U.S top diplomat, has embarked on several international travels, starting with Japan and South Korea in March 2020.\n\nBoth countries are in a region the U.S is focusing its national security apparatus.\n\nBlinken made a \u201cvirtual\u201d visit to Nigeria and Kenya on April 27, when he met President Muhammadu Buhari and President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya.\n\nWhile the U.S. Secretary of State has mostly visited Europe and the Middle East, he is yet to embark on an official visit to any country in sub-Saharan Africa. The closest he has come to Africa was on May 26, 2021 when he was in Egypt as part of a diplomatic shuttle to bring calm to the conflict between Israel and Palestine.\n\nThe flurry of meetings on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly also underscore the place of Africa on the list of priorities of the Biden administration.\n\nThe president met with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the Iraqi President Barham Saleh and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. His schedulers have been blamed for the low level of engagement with world leaders.\n\nBiden\u2019s Secretary of State, at the sidelines of the UNGA, met with his counterparts from Pakistan, Russia and China.\n\nBlinken did, however, meet with one African leader on Thursday holding talks with Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) President Felix Tshisekedi.\n\nAccording to a State Department statement, Secretary Blinken commended President Tshisekedi\u2019s leadership as African Union chair, including his efforts at strengthening relations among the Great Lakes Region countries, and stopping armed groups\u2019 illicit trafficking of natural resources in the sub-region.\n\nSecretary Blinken in the statement emphasized the United States\u2019 resolve to use all appropriate tools to end the conflict in Ethiopia, including the September 17 announcement of a new Executive Order authorizing the use of financial sanctions. The two leaders also discussed the African Union\u2019s critical role in COVID-19 response efforts, and addressing the climate crisis, as well as mediating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam dispute and de-escalating tensions in Somalia.\n\nPresident Buhari on Friday, however, secured a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, at the ongoing General Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari has said ending the security challenges in Nigeria is only a matter of time with the supply of the Super Tucano aircraft purchased from America, and other helicopters on the way.\n\nAccording to a statement by Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesima, the president also said support by the United States of America has made a great difference in Nigeria\u2019s efforts to stamp out terrorism within its borders.\n\nIn the meeting with Thomas-Greenfield, permanent representative of America to the United Nations, the president indicated that America\u2019s support was a morale booster to the military and people of Nigeria in general.\n\nOn how the country was able to mitigate the scourge of the Coronavirus pandemic, of which the ambassador said the Delta variant was \u201cvery virulent,\u201d the Nigerian leader disclosed that a special team was raised by the federal government which, in conjunction with states, educated people on safety methods, \u201cand we are not doing badly vis-a-vis our population.\u201d\n\nHe said Coronavirus does not discriminate between small and big, rich and poor countries, \u201cso we all have to collaborate and work together.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Thomas-Greenfield said about 70 per cent of her work at the UN centre on Africa, and expressed worry at the recent military takeovers in Mali and Guinea.\n\nIn his response, President Buhari said leaders have to respect their people, part of which is to obey the term-limit clauses in their Constitution.\n\n\u201cI am surprised when people spend the maximum term possible, and then tinker with the constitution to stay longer.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we try to educate our people to appreciate the democratic system. Elections should be safe and secure, no coercion of any form. People should elect the people they want. That would grow democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nOn climate change, President Buhari said the impact had been badly felt in the Lake Chad basin area, with more than 30 million people affected, deprived of access to fishing, farming, animal husbandry, and causing irregular migration and other anti-social acts.\n\nThe president then canvassed concerted action on inter-basin water transfer from Congo basin to Lake Chad.\n\nMeanwhile President Buhari aare preoccupied with security, and we are getting somewhere,\u201d the president assured, adding that the North East and the South-South, which were the issues in 2015, are stabilising, while efforts are on to restore calm to the North West, North Central, and other restive areas.\n\nOn the economy, the president said the country took decisions to shut the borders, \u201ceat what we grow, and curb smuggling,\u201d noting that if that had not been done, \u201cwe would have been in serious trouble. We are lucky to have taken the decision when we did, otherwise things would have been impossible with the advent of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nOn the resurgence of military coups in West Africa, President Buhari told his guest that he was surprised at the attitude of those tampering with the constitution of their countries, in ordef to stay longer in office. He assured that ECOWAS was doing the needful to address the developments.\n\nPrime Minister Rutte congratulated President Buhari on how he successfully leads a country of over 200 million people, wishing Nigeria greater advances.",
          "summary": "Blinken made a \u201cvirtual\u201d visit to Nigeria and Kenya on April 27, when he met President Muhammadu Buhari and President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya.\nThe president met with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the Iraqi President Barham Saleh and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\nPresident Buhari on Friday, however, secured a meeting with the U.S.\nIn his response, President Buhari said leaders have to respect their people, part of which is to obey the term-limit clauses in their Constitution.\nPrime Minister Rutte congratulated President Buhari on how he successfully leads a country of over 200 million people, wishing Nigeria greater advances.",

          "text": "Former Heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua is devastated for losing his belts to Oleksandr Usyk, his promoter, Eddie Hearn says.\n\nUsyk was crowned the new unified world heavyweight champion after a unanimous decision win over Joshua in front of 67,000 fans at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nThe judges scored the fight 117-112, 116-112, 115-113 for Usyk.\n\nHearn, in an interview with Sky Sports after thefight said he has spoken with Joshua and that it was a tough fight.\n\n\u201cHe is devastated and already talking about training again. Congratulations to Oleksandr Usyk. What a fighter. He put in a great performance and the better man won.\n\n\u201cThe danger was always to overthink it by trying to be technical, if you don\u2019t use your attributes and you don\u2019t make your mark early enough in the fight. Usyk is very fit and has great feet. He threw a lot of punches and it was all the things you worry about against a fighter like Usyk,\u201d he said.\n\nHearn added Usyk was probably bit more aggressive than anticipated and that he was really good.\n\n\u201cHe goes down in history and there are no complaints from AJ. He will go again. He has been beaten by a pound for pound great fighter. We have been here before at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\u201cThat was different and he has been beaten by the better man on the night. He will have to make some big changes in the rematch to avenge that defeat,\u201d he added.\n\nIn another interview with BBC, Hearn said \u201cWhen (Joshua) he lost in New York everyone started analysing the dressing room, the ring walk. He was fine, he was maybe a little too relaxed on the ring walk, he was shaking everyone\u2019s hand, he was hugging a few people that is just AJ but I feel it was the wrong type of performance. Sometimes you have to use your attributes.\n\n\u201c[Anthony Joshua] never really got going, he will go to hospital now, I don\u2019t know if he has broken his eye socket, it doesn\u2019t look great.\n\n\u201cBut when you go back, Tony Bellew\u2019s comments about overthinking, and fatiguing you, it is like these last three or four days you get spellbound by Usyk and you end up giving him too much respect and that becomes a problem.\n\n\u201cAJ said he is not going on holiday that he is going straight back to the gym and that is not a good idea.\n\n\u201cYou could make any manner of excuse but he got beat by the better man. Sometimes you have to take it on the chin, when you lose you shake someone\u2019s hand and say congratulations and say you will come back stronger.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Aisha Buhari Manipulates All Progressives Congress Chiefs, Plots Brother\u2019s Emergence As Adamawa Governor",
          "text": "As the 2023 elections approach, Mrs Aisha Buhari, the President\u2019s wife, has perfected a plot to install her younger brother, Mr Mohammed Halilu Modi, as the next Governor of Adamawa State, according to NEWS DIRECT.\n\nNEWS DIRECT learnt that the First Lady\u2019s machination which has torn the Adamawa chapter of the All Progressives Congress apart enjoys the full support of the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Malam Mai Mala Buni, who is also the Yobe State Governor.\n\nThe former Vice-Chairman, North-East Zone, Comrade Mustapha Salihu, and the Financial Secretary of the party, Mr Saidu Naira, were identified as the foot soldiers manipulating the congresses in Adamawa State to facilitate the emergence of the First Lady\u2019s brother as the governorship candidate of the APC in the state.\n\nA source noted that the First Lady\u2019s brother has not held any known public office, neither has he worked as a civil servant his entire life.\n\nAs it was told that as part of the preparation to ensure that her brother was tutored for the job of a governor, Aisha recently sent Modi to the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, near Jos, Plateau State, to study, while the President\u2019s wife perfected the taking over of the APC\u2019s structure in Adamawa.\n\nThere are concerns that the first lady\u2019s desperation to assume full control of the party\u2019s structure in Adamawa State is not going down well with aggrieved stakeholders.\n\nAt the just-concluded Local Government Congresses of the APC in the state, the First Lady used her influence to intimidate perceived political opponents of her brother such as Senator Dahiru Binani, Senator Mohammed Jibrilla Bindow (former Governor of the state) and Senator Ishaku Abbo (who represents Adamawa North Senatorial zone) in the Senate to hijack the party structure in the state.\n\nA source conversant with the development, explained further, \u201cThere is a serious problem brewing at the Adamawa APC, which if not resolved quickly, may cost the party the seat of governor again like it did in 2019.\n\n\u201cRecall that in 2019, the party lost the governorship contest to the incumbent and member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Ahmadu Fintiri, over this same power tussle between Mrs Buhari, Bindow, Binani and other opponents in the quest to make her brother become the governor.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, security chiefs in the state were threatened with sack if they did not cooperate by facilitating Modi\u2019s aspiration.\u201d\n\nIt was also revealed that the first casualty of the threat was the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Aliyu Adamu Alhaji, who was said to have insisted on fully supervising the congresses in Yola South.\n\nAs a result, the First Lady\u2019s candidate lost to Senator Binani\u2019s candidate.\n\nAisha, who was enraged over the turn of events, was said to have immediately seen to the transfer of the CP out of Adamawa.\n\nHe had since been replaced by a new CP, Mr Mohammed Ahmed Barde.\n\n\u201cAs things stand today, all the heads of federal agencies in the state, whose line of duty relate to supervising party congresses, are living in fear of the unknown, should they attempt to work against the interest of the First Lady\u2019s brother\u201d, another party official said.\n\nSources further revealed that most of the names from the ward and local government congresses sent to the national secretariat of the APC were altered by the quartet in Abuja, which led to aeries of litigations challenging the alterations.\n\nAisha, who is not hiding the fact of her deep involvement in the ongoing manipulation, was quoted to have said, \u201cI will not repeat the mistake of 2019 where we allowed Governor Bindow to have total control of the party to the disadvantage of many of us.\u201d\n\nSources said Aisha had vowed that she could not afford to leave office with her husband in 2023 without any of her family members taking over Adamawa State in a bid to sustain their political relevance in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cExcept something is done urgently to amicably resolve the grievances from the ward and local government congresses, especially that the state congress is close by, many stakeholders may defect to the PDP.\n\n\u201cIf this is allowed to happen, it is the APC that will be the big loser again in 2023, just like it happened in 2019. The way they are going, they can only help the PDP and governor Fintiri to win re-election in 2023\u201d, a top party official stated.\n\nIncidentally, the current manipulation in Adamawa is going on at a time the general feeling in the state is that the governorship seat should rotate to another zone outside Adamawa Central in order to engender fairness and give a sense of belonging to all the geopolitical zones in the former Gongola State.\n\nAlthough the First Lady is rooting that the Central Zone has yet to produce a governor and believes it is the turn of the zone to do so in 2023, APC stakeholders are opposing her position on the grounds that her zone produced the post of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation since 2015.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the fact that Aisha being the First Lady of the Federation and coming from the Central Zone as well, the zone has had its own fair share of the power equation and should hands off the governorship seat for another zone in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nSimilarly, the Northern Senatorial Zone had produced a governor for a record six times and the feeling is that the zone had benefitted adequately.\n\n\u201cSuch fairness can never be achieved if the congresses are manipulated against the wishes and aspirations of the people\u201d, another party source added.\n\n\u201cNow, during the local government congresses, this was what happened. While the election of party officials of Yola-South, the home local government of Sen. Binani and Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, was held at the state secretariat of the party in Jimeta amid heavy security operatives as against the Yola South party secretariat, Sen. Bindow and Sen Abbo did not even know where the congresses of Mubi North and Mubi South, their home local governments, took place till date.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson of the First Lady, Aliyu Abdullahi, who said he is in New York, declined comment when contacted on the phone, he simply said \u201cPlease I have nothing to comment on that story.\u201d",

          "title": "Breaking: Oleksandr Usyk dethrones Anthony Joshua, becomes world heavyweight champion",
          "text": "Oleksandr Usyk is the new unified heavyweight world champion after dethroning Anthony Joshua with an incredible performance in London.\n\nThe Ukrainian put on a masterclass in front of 65,000 fans inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, outclassing Joshua over 12 rounds, and hurting the defending champion on numerous occasions.\n\nThe scorecards \u2013 117-112, 116-112, 115-113 \u2013 were all for Usyk and there was a mere shrug of the shoulders from Joshua as the second defeat of his professional career was confirmed.\n\nHaving seen a fight with fellow Briton Tyson Fury collapse last summer, Joshua opted to face his WBO mandatory challenger and former undisputed cruiserweight champion Usyk instead.\n\nIt appeared the easier fight for Joshua, but boxing\u2019s triumphant return to stadium nights was soured for the home crowd by a truly exceptional performance from the challenger.\n\nUsyk pure class against one-gear Joshua\n\nJoshua was relaxed and cheerful as he approached the ring, but concentration was etched on his face from the first bell.\n\nUsyk\u2019s abilities quickly became apparent, the 34-year-old full of feints and pace from the off, moving Joshua around the ring at will as the defending champion settled into a surprisingly passive role.\n\nA few warning shots from Joshua fell short in the early rounds, Usyk either catching them with a glove or spinning away. It would become the pattern of the fight as Usyk made Joshua miss and executed a perfect gameplan of his own.\n\nA left cross from Usyk rattled Joshua in the third round, and prompted a noisy response from the crowd.\n\nJoshua rode the danger, failing to respond, but making it to the bell safely. Usyk was now brimming with confidence and the London crowd tried in vain to rouse their man into life.\n\nA low shot from Joshua brought a complaint from Usyk and Joshua fired off another, perhaps sensing a weakness in his opponent. Round five was Joshua\u2019s best to that point, but Usyk remained in control and the Briton continued to miss his attempts to land any meaningful shots.\n\nFinally, in the sixth round, Joshua landed his right hand, sparking a response form Usyk, who widened his stance and appeared ready to trade. Joshua backed off, wary of a firefight.\n\nAnd Joshua\u2019s fears were realised in the seventh as Usyk responded brilliantly to stun him with a left hook to the chin and send him stumbling backwards. Joshua stayed on his feet, surviving the round but now in a dire predicament.\n\nUsyk was comfortably ahead on the scorecards and Joshua struggled to close the gap. The huge weight advantage was nowhere in evidence, with Usyk keeping the fight at range and urgings from Joshua\u2019s corner to move forward appearing to fall on deaf ears.\n\nJoshua had Usyk briefly on the ropes in the ninth but returned to his corner with a bloody nose having caught a hard shot to the face in the closing seconds of the round.\n\nThere was blood on the faces of both men in the 11th round. Joshua had a cut and swelling on his eye; Usyk had a gash on his left eye. But while Usyk\u2019s mouth was open, he was by far the busier fighter in the penultimate round, outclassing Joshua with ease once again.\n\nThe crowd desperately tried to inspire the defending champion, who needed a knockout in the final round. But it was the challenger who almost found the decisive punch, pushing a dazed Joshua on to the ropes.\n\nThe bell saved Joshua from suffering another knockout defeat and there was a nervous wait for Usyk\u2019s team for the scorecards.\n\nThere were to be no more shocks, however, as all three judges gave it to the challenger and ended Joshua\u2019s short second reign as world champion after just one fight.\n\nJoshua left at a crossroads\n\nIt is unclear where Joshua goes from here. There is a rematch clause, one that the two-time world champion is likely to exercise.\n\nHe now has two losses to his name and on both occasions the Briton was dominated by a smaller man. Usyk did not find the knockout punch, but he exposed Joshua\u2019s frailties and somewhat light attacking arsenal.\n\nJoshua had no answer to Usyk and while his opponent glided across the ring, the champion appeared to be dragging his feet through mud. There was no attempt to bully Usyk, wear him down or go to the body.\n\nIt was a strange, almost hapless display from Joshua which leaves his legacy as one of the heavyweight greats in ruins.\n\nAside from the Briton\u2019s long-term career prospects, Joshua versus Fury now appears to be dead.\n\nFury fights Deontay Wilder next month in Las Vegas and every fight fan\u2019s greatest fear has been realised after the unification bout collapsed last summer.\n\nTo begin with, Joshua will have to win his rematch with Usyk which, after Saturday night\u2019s meeting, appears a near impossible prospect.",

          "text": "Former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Khalifa Muhammad Sanusi has sounded the death knell for Nigerian economy, noting that crude oil on which the economy is anchored has no future and is no longer sought after globally.\n\nAddressing the sixth Kaduna Investment Summit, after inaugurating the state development plan 2021 to 2023, to transform the state into a knowledge-based economy, the former Emir of Kano said despite having difficulty in producing crude oil, which has been the mainstay of Nigerian economy for decades, the product is now being rejected globally, as there are no longer future in carbon with renewable energy taking over.\n\nWhile pointing out that the future lies in knowledge-based economy, Sanusi lamented that Nigeria lies behind many African countries in innovation index, ranking 114th globally.\n\n\u201cWork is being redefined. Thirty to 40 per cent of workers in developed economies will need to significantly upgrade their skills by 2030.\n\n\u201cAnd what are the major drivers of this redefinition? ICT and remote working, which we have seen even here with COVID. There is increased automation and artificial intelligence. Very soon, robots will take over work in most countries and those who would have job are those who operate the robots or manufactured the robots or service the robot.\n\n\u201cAnd you have decarbonisation. For us in Nigeria, the enclave economy that we have, the so called goose that lays the golden egg (oil) is about to die. There will be no eggs. The future is not in the carbons. Few months ago, Germany was able to produce enough renewable energy for the entire country\u2019s need. Today, we are having difficulties selling Nigerian oil, the market is not there.\n\n\u201cSo, this is forcing a change, and for us a country that depends on oil, things need to change. Nigeria is ranked 114th in the global innovation index. We are lower than other African countries such as Kenya, Rwanda and Senegal. We are in fact ranked 14th in sub Saharan Africa. I think we should have reality check and know where we are as a country. Let\u2019s stop calling ourselves the giant of Africa, because we are the giant with clay feet.\n\n\u201cCountries like Kenya, Rwanda and Senegal are ahead of us. I am not even talking about South Africa. Our expenditure on education is only seven per cent of the budget. We are spending less on education than Ghana; I am not talking about as per percentage of the budget; in absolute terms. Even though the Ghanaian economy is much smaller than the Nigerian economy, even though the Ghanaian revenue is less than Nigerian revenue, Ghana is spending more on education than Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised that industries are moving to Ghana. Are we surprised that the Ghanaian President has become the leading President in Africa? We are not investing in education and human capital. We have a 68% missing job requirement and the major areas being IT, communication and decision making.\n\n\u201cThe completion rate between entry into primary one and completing university is eight per cent, meaning that out of every 100 pupil who go into primary school, only eight come out of university. And out of those eight, nine percent, which is one of the eight will get job. So, this is the reality in addition to what is happening globally.\n\n\u201cNow, digitisation to level the playing field is required, if we are deliberate and we shift from consumption to value creation. But, part of our problem is that, even when we have the solution at our feet, we do not take it. If somebody want to innovate in the health sector it is to have data of people who use medical service, the location of hospital to create and innovate solutions that will provide easy access to healthcare delivery and education,\u201d he said.\n\nThe renowned economist called on government to provide uninhibited data support and market access for the private sector.\n\n\u201cIf Kaduna state government continues with its e-government plan, it will be a big market itself and will encourage investment which are all knowledge economy aspiration and a shift in government spending to match the priority.\n\n\u201cJob creation in a knowledge economy is not about creating jobs in Kaduna but equipping citizens with skills to participate in the global economy. Global platforms enable people with development skills to find employment anywhere in the world which is the future of knowledge economy,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kaduna state government will be introducing ICT skills in vocational institutes, primary and secondary schools across the state, according to Governor Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nHe said his administration believes that the future of job in the world will be digital.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cEveryone needs digital skills and we intend to provide that, we have agreement with IHS to cover Kaduna with 3g and 4g network so that everyone will have access to internet.\n\n\u201cKaduna state will continue impacting digital skill and providing infrastructure, opportunity that young people will take advantage of. We believe in planning, and thinking through what our state need, so we develop human capital capacity. Kadinvest is a key platform in which our state can present it\u2019s plan and invite investors to join in implementing on the economic development plan for the state.\n\n\u201cForty percent of Kaduna state population is below the age of 15 and 89% is below the age of 35. Young people are very energetic and entrepreneur but they need opportunity, education and skills. We have been investing between 40% \u2013 45% of annual budget on education and health care because we believe that those are the fundamental foundation for building human capacity.\u201d",

          "text": "The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has flagged off its campaign for the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nThis comes six weeks to the date announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct the poll across the local government areas of the state.\n\nParty faithful, in hundreds, thronged the Alex Ekwueme Square in Awka, the state capital on Saturday where a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, was formally presented as the candidate of APGA in the November 6 election.\n\nHis emergence as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the poll followed a series of disagreements \u2013 that led to court cases \u2013 among party leaders over the choice of candidate for the poll.\n\nIncumbent governor, Willie Obiano, who has served the state on two terms, was physically present at the event, along with his wife, Mrs Ebele.\n\nThe couple, Soludo, and APGA National Chairman, Victor Oye, among other party leaders, took turns to address the crowd of party supporters at the event.\n\nUpon taking the stage, Oye who was the first of the aforementioned four to speak reeled out the achievements of the party over the years.\n\n\u201cAPGA has performed in Anambra State,\u201d he said. \u201cOur records in Anambra State are impeccable; our records in Anambra State, nobody can erase it. Our governor, Willie Obiano, has performed creditably and the incoming governor (in his view), Chukwuma Soludo, will perform superlatively.\n\n\u201cThere is no political party in Nigeria that has the capacity to turn around the lives of the people as much as APGA has done.\u201d\n\nOye also took a swipe at the two frontline political parties in the country \u2013 All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), saying, \u201cVery soon, both of them will go into an irreversible coma, and APGA will become the ultimate undertakers.\u201d\n\n\u2018Who Can Battle With The Lord?\u2019\n\nIn her remarks, Mrs Obiano who had a majority of her speech delivered in Igbo canvassed support for the party.\n\nAccording to her, it is important for the people to vote for the party\u2019s candidate in the coming election in order to continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy in the state.\n\nThereafter, Soludo was presented the party\u2019s flag \u2013 symbolising his status as the party\u2019s candidate \u2013 by Governor Obiano and Mr Oye.\n\nHe began his acceptance speech with a song titled \u2018Who Can Battle With The Lord?\u2019 after which he thanked the party leaders and members for their support all through the events that led to his emergence as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\n\u201cWith a deep sense of humility and gratitude to Almighty, gratitude to our lovely party that gave me the opportunity to be able to fly this flag, we accept to fly this flag,\u201d the party\u2019s candidate said. \u201cBy the special grace of God, the will and wish of the people have been expressed.\n\n\u201cThere are 32 support and self-funding groups with a membership of over 500,000 across Anambra, Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Enugu, everywhere, that have worked tirelessly for over two years.\n\n\u201cThe next thing that should happen in Anambra will be to consolidate the wonderful works that are ongoing, especially under the 16 years of APGA in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obiano, in his remarks, explained why he believes his party will win again in the forthcoming election.\n\n\u201cIn the last 15 and half years, we have delivered the dividend of democracy to Anambra residents, and particularly in the last seven and half years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why our candidate will win, and win landslide.\n\n\u201cSo many things have been said about my achievements which most of you know but let me show some examples. The international cargo and passenger airport in Anambra that I built in 15 months, the runway is the second-longest in Nigeria. It has the tallest tower in Nigeria and the most modern terminal building, and I built this airport without borrowing a kobo.\u201d",

          "text": "The Buhari administration is encouraging State governments in the country to follow suit having itself spent about N8.9 Trillion, a record sum, on infrastructure and capital alone since its inception,\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, says such spending on infrastructural development would not only help position States to become major industrial hubs, but also yield multiplier economic benefits, while at the same time attracting more investors from around the world,.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Friday in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, where he flagged off the construction of a housing estate and commissioned the Dakkada Tower as part of activities marking the 34th Anniversary of the State\u2019s creation.\n\nAkwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel received the Vice President at the airport, alongside other dignitaries, including the former Governors of Cross River and Benue States: Mr. Donald Duke and Senator Gabriel Suswam. Others top government officials at the events included members of the National Assembly, top State government officials, including the Akwa Ibom State Deputy Governor, Mr. Moses Ekpo, the Special Adviser to the President on Economic Affairs, Dr. Adeyemi Dipeolu, and the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta, Senator Ita Enang, among others.\n\nBringing with him to the State the warm felicitations of President Muhammadu Buhari to the Governor, the government and people of the State, the Vice President stated that the President \u201casked that I specially congratulate you, Mr. Governor, and the good people of Akwa Ibom State on the 34th Anniversary of this great State.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President observed that the focus of the Akwa Ibom State government on infrastructure development is significantly in sync with the centrepiece of the Federal Government\u2019s economic agenda.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, since the inception of our administration Mr. President has prioritised the development of infrastructure: roads, rail, power and broadband; and despite the severe economic headwinds we have experienced in the past 6 years, we have invested more than any other administration in infrastructure,\u201d the VP asserted.\n\nHe disclosed that \u201cas of last year, we had expended over N7.6 Trillion on infrastructure alone (and about N8.9 Trillion on the entire capital expenditure).\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Prof. Osinbajo stated that \u201cjust last month, the Federal Executive Council approved the Lagos Calabar rail project, which will pass through Uyo as a major station, and at the end of last year, FEC also approved the full business case for the Ibom deep sea port. These infrastructural developments are set to establish Akwa Ibom as a major industrial hub, not just in Nigeria, but in the West African sub region.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted Governor Emmanuel Udom\u2019s industrialization agenda for the State, noting that, \u201cwhen I was here in 2019, we commissioned the Kings Flour mills, Lions Plywood and Timber Factory and the power substation. Since then, you have done far more and you have even launched an airline, Ibom Air, which has become the gold standard nationally for promptness and efficient service.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo then commended the State government for \u201cconsistently reinventing itself to remain competitive and attractive to the investment community.\u201d\n\nOn building infrastructure to serve the populace, the VP noted that the Buhari administration\u2019s mass social housing programme under its Economic Sustainability Plan is one aspect of how the Federal Government is investing in infrastructure to create jobs and unlock capital for individual and corporate prosperity.\n\nHe then stated that the Ibom Luxury Estate, the new Akwa Ibom housing estate (the construction of which was flagged off today) is also strategic as investors from around the world and management of industry and businesses that will be attracted to the State will want good world class accommodation.\n\n\u201cThey will want a safe environment to raise their families; the Ibom Luxury Estate is the answer to that need,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo noted.\n\nGenerally, he stated that \u201cthere are also, of course, the multiplier economic benefits of housing projects. Housing projects create several direct and indirect jobs, and frankly, aside from the provision of decent shelter, it really is an important job creator. So, this project will provide several jobs during and post-construction, coupled with property taxation, which will form additional streams of revenue for the State\u2019s coffers.\n\n\u201cWhich is why as part of our Economic Sustainability Plan, we have our mass social housing programme. This is part of our jobs for houses programme, which is run by the Family Homes Fund, where we intend to build 300,000 housing units across the country. We intend to use local materials, builders and artisans in every State.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to note that Akwa Ibom State has keyed into this important programme and has already made land available. And it is called the Dakkada Affordable Housing. It is surely the way to unlock capital for individual and corporate prosperity, but it requires executive and legislative collaboration to ensure its success.\u201d\n\nWhen completed, the estate will have a police station, power-sub- station, clinic and health care centre, gas plant, sewage treatment plant, civic centre, church, school and other amenities.\n\nProf. Osinbajo urged \u201cthe State House of Assembly to continue to work with the Executive to make all land administrative processes friendly, seamless and swift. This will revolutionize your real estate sector and unlock more investment opportunities for Akwa Ibom.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, while speaking at the commissioning of the Dakkada Tower, which is regarded as among the tallest buildings in Nigeria, Prof. Osinbajo recalled that Governor Udom had shared his administration\u2019s vision to construct the tallest building in the South South and South East Region in the State.\n\n\u201cToday, I am filled with joy to witness the realisation of the dream as we gather to celebrate a commitment to excellence and vision as represented by the 21-storey edifice before us,\u201d the VP enthused.\n\n\u201cThe completion of the Dakkada Tower will most definitely address the paucity of world-class office accommodation for both local, corporate and international companies, especially oil and gas companies. With this development, the big players in corporate Nigeria, and especially in the oil and gas industry, should now find it entirely auspicious to relocate their administrative headquarters to Uyo.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President further noted that the tower is a state-of-the-art smart building, combining architectural beauty with the latest technology developed for smart and efficient work spaces.\n\nEarlier, Governor Udom Emmanuel thanked the Vice President for honoring the invitation of the State Government, describing him as \u201cthe pride of Nigeria\u201d and \u201cour brother, our teacher, our pastor, our mentor.\u201d\n\nThe Governor further said the State is investor friendly and \u201cwe are spearheading innovations that will generate revenue and create jobs and will put us on the world map.\u201d\n\nHe said the Dakkada Estate\u2019s water system meets the WHO standard, has a separate power turbine system, four avenues, safe city security system and many other amenities.\n\nHe added the Dakkada Tower was in response to the federal government\u2019s call that oil companies operating in the oil producing States should establish corporate offices in the state of their operations.",

          "title": "Vice President Osinbajo urges smart Nigerian Youth to fill tech gap -",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, says Nigeria has now become the technology investment destination in Sub-Saharan Africa just as he asserted that the Buhari administration will continue to step up efforts in providing stable macroeconomic, conducive business environment, infrastructure and security nationwide.\n\nHe also noted that Nigeria can reap more rewards from maximizing its immense potential, especially that of its youths, in a sustainable way in a knowledge-based economy. This is especially so because there is indeed a shortage of tech talents in the world, and Nigerian youths can fill that global gap.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Thursday during a one-day working visit to Kaduna State, where he was the Special Guest of Honour at the Kaduna Economic & Investment Summit (KADINVEST 6.0), with the theme, \u201cTowards a Sustainable Knowledge-based Economy.\u201d KADINVEST, now in its sixth edition, is a platform to showcase and promote Kaduna State and Nigeria as a major investment destination in Africa.\n\nThe VP also commissioned the rebuilt and modernized Kasuwan Magani Market alongside a 100-Kilowatts Solar PV Mini-Grid in the Kajuru Local Government Area of the State.\n\n\u201cHow do we create adequate resource capacity and capability? What will it take to train and equip enough Engineers, Technologists, Scientists, Doctors, and other products of STEM curricula to drive a knowledge-based economy? Thankfully, we are not alone in this, as there are global shortages everywhere of technological talent,\u201d the VP reasoned.\n\nHe continued, \u201ca recent analysis showed that the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning talent gap globally stands at 1.2 million resources, while there are only 650 thousand professionals employable in these roles.\n\n\u201cThe best OECD countries have 16 scientists/researchers per 1000 employees and spend 1 to 3% of GDP on Research and Development, where do we stand on that scale? How do we accelerate our progress?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwith global gaps in talent, well-planned training programmes could even see Nigeria become a hub for critical technical talent. This was proven with the success of Andela in developing and placing Software Engineering talent and can be replicated across a broader range of STEM disciplines.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the great strides being made by Nigerian youth in reaping the rewards of a knowledge economy through digital technology, the VP noted that \u201cNigeria is now the technology investment destination in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nHe explained briefly how. \u201cHere in Nigeria, youth-run digital businesses are also making great strides. FinTech companies and other technology-enabled solutions are expanding so rapidly that the future of banking and financial services may not belong to banks or bankers as we know them today.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Paystack which was recently acquired for $200million, Kuda Bank without a single physical branch, Prospa that is revolutionizing banking for small businesses by tailoring banking and digital solutions, and Eyowo that built the platform for TraderMoni and MarketMoni, are creating jobs and crowding in investment.\n\n\u201cWe are also seeing the impact of disruptive technology in our critical agricultural sector. Tomato Jos\u2019 processing facility will be commissioned tomorrow here in Kaduna with a capacity to produce tomato paste of 85 tonnes per day (another product of KADINVEST). Tomato Jos is helping build a model for integration of processing and subsistence farming that can be scaled across the country to solve our perennial issue of producing raw materials without knowledge-based value addition.\n\n\u201cAside from Tomato Jos, there are many other innovative companies doing well in this space such as BabbanGona that provides training, financial credit, agricultural inputs, harvesting, and marketing support to smallholder farmers.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Prof. Osinbajo added that a \u201csound, relevant, practical, problem-solving, education\u201d system will further boost national development because a knowledge-based economy \u201cis entirely dependent on intellectual capital, a workforce, and talent pool that is educated, adaptable and dynamic.\u201d\n\nHe said the STEAM curriculum being developed by the Federal Ministry of Education, which has added \u2018Arts\u201d to \u201cScience, Technology, Engineering, and Math or STEM education is crucial towards \u201cdeveloping an education system that would resource and support the knowledge economy: from teacher training to acquiring technology and other equipment.\u201d\n\nThe VP also highlighted the importance of effective coordination and collaboration between the Federal and State governments in achieving mutual goals of infrastructure and socio-economic development.\n\nHe noted that the efforts of the Kaduna State government in this regard \u201care clearly positioned to benefit maximally from the critical infrastructure development that the President has committed so single-mindedly to, since the inception of our administration.\n\n\u201cFederal Government investments in this axis, complemented by the policies and investments of the Kaduna State Government will catalyze an economic hub that will create millions of jobs and opportunities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the VP, in addition to kinetic interventions, jobs and social protection are vital for security and sustainable development.\n\n\u201cWe are making accelerated efforts to enhance security across the country, and in this region particularly,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the theme of the event, the Vice President noted that that there should be more focus on developing a knowledge-based economy.\n\nExplaining, the VP stated that, \u201cthe knowledge economy really refers to how human capital \u2013 that is education and knowledge \u2014 can become productive assets or business products to be sold for profit. This is simply the commercialization of intellectual capacity rather than natural resources or physical contributions.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthe trajectory of economic development has tended to be from agriculture and manufacturing to services, and then as countries become wealthier, the knowledge economy becomes the main source of economic rewards.\n\n\u201cBut the sheer versatility of technology has made leapfrogging easier than ever before. Indeed, rather than go from stage to stage, the knowledge economy can enhance our performance and benefits from agriculture, manufacturing, and services,\u201d he said.\n\nShortly after attending the KADINVEST 6.0 event, the Vice President was at the commissioning of the rebuilt and modernized Kasuwan Magani Market and 100-Kilowatts Solar PV Mini-Grid, Kajuru LGA in the State, where he received a rousing welcome from the locals on arrival.\n\nAt the commissioning of the market, which had been burnt down during past ethnic conflicts, the VP noted the \u201cimportance of community building, partnership, and tolerance amongst our people and a new narrative of growth, togetherness, economic progress, and development.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo said the unique design of the new market and reorganization of its 942 stalls would encourage interaction and partnership amongst diverse groups.\n\n\u201cOur joint and common interests as Nigerians outweigh our ethnic and religious differences,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn the same vein, at the commissioning of the solar PV mini-grid, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201cthe Ministry of Power through the Rural Electrification Agency partnered with Kaduna State Government and Blue Camel to create a sustainable, clean source of power for the market.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also noted that the Economic Sustainability Plan, ESP SolarPowerNaija project, is aimed at providing 5 million homes with electricity through solar systems and mini-grids, and thus improving access to electricity for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe funding mechanism for the Solar PV plant today would not have been possible without the intervention of the Buhari Administration. Despite the passage of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act in 2005, the activation of the Rural Electrification Fund (REF) only commenced in 2019, a staggering 14 years after the passing of the Act.\n\n\u201cIn the two REF cycles executed thus far, more than N6 billion worth of projects have been executed with 42,000 connections being created, impacting an estimated 200,000 Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President, who was received on arrival in the State by Governor Nasir El-Rufai, and other senior State government officials, commended the State Governor for his efforts in developing the State.\n\nIn his remarks at the commissioning, Governor El-Rufai described VP Osinbajo as \u201ca bridge-builder and a man of deep social conscience, who cares deeply about the poor and about giving them the opportunity to prosper economically.\u201d\n\nGovernor Rufai praised the Vice President, expressing appreciation that he came \u201cto commission this project.\n\n\u201cThis community is probably seeing a helicopter for the first time. This community is seeing the Vice President for the first time and we are seeing their excitement. We wanted you to commission this market.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Governor, the Kaduna State Government wanted Prof. Osinbajo to commission the market \u201cfor several reasons.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency; the first is that you are a man of deep social conscience. You care deeply about poor people and you care about giving them the opportunity to prosper economically. This is one of the reasons why we felt that you are the one that should commission this market.\n\n\u201cThe second reason Sir, Mr Vice President, is that you are a bridge-builder. You are a pastor who is a friend to Imams and Emirs. You are a Professor who can speak the language of ordinary people. You are the lawyer who pursues justice, not technicalities.\n\n\u201cYou care for people, you care for Nigerians and you care for unity in diversity. You care about differences in religion and ethnicity and you always promote peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cNo one, Your Excellency, is more qualified to commission this market in this community at this time than Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Federal Executive Council accompanied the Vice President to Kaduna, including the Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning Mrs (Dr.) Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed and the Minister of Power Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu.",

          "title": "Sky Sports: In Usyk, Joshua Faces Toughest Opponent of His Career, Victory Would Be His Greatest Yet",
          "text": "There was a mischievous moment this week when Oleksandr Usyk\u2019s entourage found Anthony Joshua\u2019s car and, while laughing, they inscribed in dust the challenger\u2019s name onto the door. An unpleasant surprise for when the champion returned.\n\nIt was a reminder that beyond the prestige and mutual admiration of this magnificent world heavyweight championship fight there is also a healthy dose of disrespect.\n\nThe most difficult fight of Joshua\u2019s career is against Usyk Saturday night, from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in front of 70,000 passionate fans, live on Sky Sports Box Office.\n\nJoshua has been in compelling fights before but none quite like this \u2013 the Wladimir Klitschko fight may always define him and the Andy Ruiz Jr rematch genuinely divided predictions, but Usyk represents a unique and complex challenge.\n\nUndefeated and undisputed as a cruiserweight, there is a sprinkling of stardust over the enigmatic Usyk. He is a southpaw (Joshua has boxed just one-and-a-half rounds against a left-hander in his pro career) and he is vying to become only the third boxer ever to become world champion at cruiser and heavyweight.\n\nThe Ukrainian with the menacing smile arrived with a shaven head and a handlebar moustache \u2013 it is a throwback to his warrior ancestry, to the 17th Century Cossack people, who fought with swords on horseback. His change of look is a sign of intent.\n\nHe has worn colourful socks with aliens on them, then dressed as Batman\u2019s rival The Joker, but none of Usyk\u2019s idiosyncrasies are a laughing matter for Joshua.\n\nThe IBF, WBA and WBO champion has called this a fight \u201cfor the brain\u201d but there is clearly an intriguing physical element \u2013 after weeks of rumours suggesting Joshua would come in light to match Usyk\u2019s nimbleness, he weighed in as his usual rock-solid self.\n\nHis pre-fight work-out routine was a calculated attempt not to allow the juggling and entertaining Usyk to steal the limelight. Previously when he fought Kubrat Pulev, Joshua\u2019s public work-out consisted of merely wrapping his hands before he asked cameras to leave but, this time, he performed too.\n\nThis is surely a fight to be settled in the nerve-shredding final few rounds, perhaps even with an excruciating wait for the scorecards after Joshua and Usyk have duked out their best punches.\n\n\u201cI think, at first, it will be chess,\u201d Usyk said.\n\nJoshua must not be lured into Usyk\u2019s realm and has warned: \u201cI can out-box him, of course I can. And I can out-strength him.\n\n\u201cObviously we have our go-to \u2013 our strength. I will use my strengths.\u201d\n\nUsyk\u2019s strengths are his movement and his IQ, factors which mean he has not lost since he was an amateur a decade ago.\n\nHe has a stunning habit of upstaging the local favourite \u2013 in Russia, Latvia, the US, Poland and the UK he has won at least seven fights in his opponent\u2019s back yard. He will know that the council estate Joshua grew up in is just a few miles away and will relish spoiling the party.\n\nUsyk has long been an elite fighter but he is now at his absolute peak and that is what makes him the toughest rival of Joshua\u2019s career.\n\nBut he will meet Joshua 3.0 inside the ring tonight \u2013 not the talented and physical up-and-comer, not the fighter who survived a rollercoaster ride, but a reigning champion in his physical and mental pomp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an easy fight for anyone,\u201d Joshua has said and he\u2019s absolutely right.\n\nFor while Usyk may be a unique test for Joshua, Joshua is certainly the most perilous examination of Usyk\u2019s skills.\n\nTonight\u2019s fight represents the conclusion to a 10-year mission for Usyk, who first watched a 21-year-old Joshua lose an amateur fight but still predicted that he would become Olympic champion. A year later they both won gold at London 2012 and Usyk has kept an eye on Joshua ever since.\n\nWhat secrets Klitschko has whispered are also a mystery \u2013 Joshua\u2019s team said he \u201cdenounced any involvement\u201d but Usyk said \u201cI keep talking to him\u201d.\n\nThe biggest compliment that can be paid to this enthralling fight is that mentions of Tyson Fury have been kept to a bare minimum. The dream undisputed title fight will never become a reality unless Joshua can dispatch Usyk tonight, in the most difficult task of his career.\n\nSky Sports",

They would dilute the value and meaning of club and country competitions.\n\n\u201cThey would diminish and conflict with women\u2019s and youth football \u2013 being under-represented areas of the game where ECA and others are committing significant time, talent and resources \u2013 while also subordinating other sporting tournaments and interests at all levels worldwide.\n\n\u201cGiven the centrality of the IMC to club football, and of club football to the IMC, ECA reiterates in the most unambiguous terms that any decisions relating to its future can only come about with the consent of football clubs, with player welfare at their heart \u2013 and in keeping with legally binding obligations which ordinarily should not need restating.\u201d\n\nEverton boss Rafa Benitez said he was against the plans for a biennial World Cup.\n\n\u201cMy first impression with international football is that you have too many games,\u201d Benitez said. \u201cWe have to be careful because in the end, the clubs are paying the players and they have to perform in their league and compete at maximum level. It\u2019s not that you have to play more, it\u2019s you have to play less games, and more competitive games.\u201d",

Yes, it is a problem,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the relevant people are working on this. I know they\u2019re working on this, but there\u2019s nothing decided yet, at least as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem when the Brazilians are allowed, or when they go, to the next internationals.\u201d\n\nLiverpool are set to travel to Watford on 16 September without Alisson and Fabinho, as Brazil host Uruguay on 15 September.\n\nKlopp added: \u201cI know it\u2019s a Liverpool problem and nobody else\u2019s problem, and good for Watford.\n\n\u201cBut I just don\u2019t know how you can do these kind of things where nobody reacts on the schedule.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said Boko Haram terrorists, though weakened by the military, \u201care still active in the country, preying on soft targets,\u201d promising that the scourge would soon come to an end.\n\nBuhari, who spoke in New York, United States, while addressing world leaders, including the new President of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, during the 76th session of the Assembly, called for the support of the world body to end the Boko Haram menace.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cMr. President, terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to work closely with the UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n\u201cNigeria has spared no efforts in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria, the Lake Chad region as well as banditry in the North-West and the North-Central. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\u201d\n\nThe President lamented that Nigeria was concerned about illicit trading and movement of small arms, which he said had led to an increase in criminality and insurgency in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari also lamented that countries such as Nigeria spend the bulk of their revenues on debt servicing, leaving little for infrastructure development and other essential aspects of the economy such as healthcare and education.\n\nAs a result, he called for the extension of the debt repayment timeline for developing countries, especially those severely suffering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBuhari said \u201cthere is an urgent need for debt repayment extension for developing countries that are still recovering from the pandemic and also struggling with liquidity challenges.\u201d\n\nHe also called for an inclusive agenda that would build resilience and stability against future shocks; to deliver on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeveloping countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n\u201cI must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20, aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.\n\n\u201cIn addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also took a swipe at the recent coup detat in Mali and Guinea and canvassed the support of the international community to reject the unconstitutional governments in the two West African nations.\n\nHe declared that the recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nThe President warned that democratic gains of the past decades in West Africa \u201care now being eroded\u201d due to these negative trends.\n\nHe affirmed Nigeria\u2019s support to efforts by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) to address this growing challenge, saying, \u201cAs leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\u201d\n\nThe President urged the international community not only to deal with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes of conflicts in the first place.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThese include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\u201d\n\nHe renewed his advocacy for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, outlining steps Nigeria had taken to achieve \u201cmoderate success\u201d in containing the virus and halt its deadly onslaught in the country.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cNigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe rising wave of newer and more contagious strains make this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nCommenting on international trade, the Nigerian leader canvassed for reforms that would engender recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n\u201cMy delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid.\n\n\u201cMy country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also reiterated his call for the reforms of the UN Security Council, stressing that inter-governmental negotiation on the issue, was taking too long.\n\n\u201cNo reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid going in circles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\n\n\u201cIt is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our organisation is called to question.\n\n\u201cWe can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session,\u201d he said.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
