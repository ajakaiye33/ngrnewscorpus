          "title": "FG\u2019s GDP growth meaningless with rising poverty \u2013 Obi",
          "text": "THE vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 general elections, Peter Obi, has faulted the latest National Bureau of Statistics report which stated that the country\u2019s economy has recorded a five per cent growth to Gross Domestic Product growth.\n\nHe added that growth with rising poverty in the country was meaningless.\n\nObi spoke on Sunday evening when he featured on a Channels Television programme, \u2018Politics Today\u2019.\n\nHe specifically said rather than celebrating growth to GDP, which had no impact in the citizenry, the Federal Government should stop borrowing for consumption and face investment.\n\nThe former governor of Anambra State said the fact that the Federal Government had been borrowing money and spending it on consumption had not made the NBS report to make significant impact in the lives of an average Nigerian.\n\nObi noted that the Federal Government should concentrate on the small and medium enterprises, education as well as target its citizens in the Diaspora if it really wanted to make significant impact in the lives of its citizenry.\n\nObi said, \u201cThe type of growth I want to see is the one that will pull Nigerians out of poverty by making the people to have disposable income and be able to feed themselves.\n\n\u201cWe need the type of growth that will educate our children, provide primary health care for all the communities. We don\u2019t need growth based on speculations that government officials are celebrating all over the places.\u201d\n\nObi insisted that growth to GDP could only be celebrated in a country when people are happy with their disposable income and be able to take good care of themselves and members of their family.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe biggest engine for economic growth is the micro, small, medium enterprises. That is the practice all over the World.\n\n\u201cThat engine today is not being supported in Nigeria. Nigeria has a total of 40 million SMEs but there is not properly articulated fiscal and monetary policy to support the critical sector.\n\n\u201cThe entire loan to private sector on Nigeria today is about N30trn. Less than N1.5trn is going to the SMEs. This is less than five per cent of the entire loan. This means Nigeria is not supporting its engine that can enhance the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe SMEs are the biggest employer of labour in many advanced countries of the world. We need fiscal monetary policies that would invest in this engine of growth in order to create jobs.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026as YAF goes on peace advocacy visits\n\nBy Adesina Wahab\n\nProminent traditional rulers in the six states of the South-West geo-political zone have enjoined all Yoruba sons and daughters to embrace peace and eschew acts that can lead to the disintegration of Nigeria.\n\nThe traditional rulers, including the Olubadan of Ibadanland in Oyo State, Oba Saliu Adetunji; Soun of Ogbomosoland, Oyo State, Oba Jimoh Ajagungbade III; Olowo of Owo, Ondo State, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin, Ogunoye III; Oluwo of Iwoland in Osun State, Oba AbdulRasheed Akanbi; Onisan of Isan-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Oba Gabriel Adetila; Olu of Moloko-Asipa, Igbore, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Oba Nureni Adesina; and the Elemure of Emure-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Oba Emmanuel Adebayo, stated this when a delegation of the Yoruba Appraisal Forum [YAF] led by its National Coordinator, Adeshina Animashaun, paid them peace advocacy and courtesy visits in their respective palaces last week.\n\nAccording to them, violence will only end up worsening the already tense situation in the country.\n\nThe royal fathers advised Yoruba youths to support all efforts to ensure absolute peace in Nigeria and appealed to the individuals and groups agitating for a separate Yoruba nation to sheathe their swords and rather join hands with other patriots to work the development and growth of Nigeria.\n\nThey, however, enjoined all aggrieved Yoruba to register to vote in the 2023 general elections in order to right the perceived wrongs being suffered by the people of the region under the Nigerian Federation.\n\nOlubadan said, \u201cI\u2019m happy over your visit to my palace. I can see the wisdom in what you\u2019re doing. So many things are happening at this point in time. I want to assure you that the Yoruba are not sleeping or docile. My prayer is that Yorubaland will not experience any chaos or violence.\n\nBefore we are all Nigerians, we\u2019re first and foremost Yoruba. We all know our different origins and sources. Nigeria today is divided into six geo-political zones and we\u2019re in the South-West. We have South-East, South-South, North-Central, North-East and North-West.\n\nBut if we look very well today, out of all of them, it is the South-West that is most developed. Is it in the area of the economy, education, health, road infrastructure and so on? God has been very merciful to us (South-West). God has also blessed Yorubaland with prominent Pastors, Imams and traditional religionists.\n\nAll these eminent Yoruba sons and daughters are not resting on their oars at all. They hold meetings regularly \u2013 the royal fathers, the governors. There is this meeting called South-West Stakeholders Forum.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t address a crisis with another crisis. We mustn\u2019t allow the situation to degenerate. If some people are planning to cause chaos, we mustn\u2019t allow them to spoil things. We\u2019ll appeal to them with reasons that those bent on destroying the country should be avoided so that they won\u2019t drag you and me as well as all Yoruba into their mischief. Please, remain patient. It shall be well with us all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Soun of Ogbomosoland, Oba Ajagungbade III, warned those agitating for a separate Yoruba Nation to perish the thought, saying the Yoruba race has nothing to benefit from seceding from a united Nigeria.\n\nOba Oyewunmi enjoined Yoruba youths to rather prepare to register to vote and participate massively in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe monarch said, \u201cWhich ethnic group in Nigeria is the largest? You\u2019re talking about 2023 elections, I think the majority will always carry the vote. This you should not forget. This is one area you should work on.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Jos, the then Ooni Adesoji Aderemi had a company in Jos and whenever he came around, we\u2019ll all meet him at Hill Station. If there was no cooperation would he have his company there? I\u2019m not in support of any ethnic group seceding from Nigeria. I\u2019ll advise you to pursue programmes that will bring peace to all Nigerians. You, youths should come together and take up this challenge.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin Ogunoye III, stated that there was no basis for the current agitations by some persons for the secession of Yorubaland from the rest of the country.\n\nOba Ogunoye, however, advocated for a return of the country to true Federalism, saying the constitution of Nigeria by different ethnic groups necessitated the adoption of true Federalism at independence.\n\n\u201cIf we can return to true Federalism, everything will be fine for Nigeria. For now, there is no basis for agitations for secession. Before independence, the realisation of the fact that we are of different ethnic nationalities necessitated the adoption of true Federalism. May God help us. Yorubaland won\u2019t disintegrate or be destroyed,\u201d he told the YAF delegation at his palace in Owo, Ondo State.\n\nThe Oluwo of Iwoland in Osun State, Oba Akanbi, during the visit to his palace by YAF, expressed his opposition to any plan by the Yoruba to break away from the rest of Nigeria.\n\nOba Akanbi, who was represented by the Aro of Iwo, Chief Ola IyanuOluwa, who received the YAF delegation at the Oluwo\u2019s palace in Iwo, warned those agitating for a separate Yoruba nation not instigate crisis in Yorubaland.\n\nWhile also receiving the YAF team at his palace, the Onisan of Isan-Ekiti, Oba Adetila, warned that it\u2019s impossible for Yorubaland to secede from Nigeria.\n\nOba Adetila, who also praised YAF for embarking on such a peace advocacy programme, stressed that rather than going to war or instigating violence, the right things must be done by all to achieve unity and ensure peace.\n\nThe Elemure of Emure-Ekiti, Oba Adebayo, warned Yoruba youths not to allow themselves to be used by politicians to foment trouble under the guise of agitating for Yoruba nation.\n\nAccording to Oba Adebayo, \u201cNobody should be thinking of fighting any war. Whoever wants to fight war should withdraw all his children in America and UK back home to fight. How many of our politicians\u2019 children are part of all these troubles? They should bring their own children back home and make them the captains of the battalions, which they won\u2019t be ready to do.\u201d\n\nAlso while welcoming the YAF delegation to his palace in Abeokuta, Ogun State, the Olu of Moloku-Asipa, Igbore, Abeokuta, Oba Adesina, said that the Alake and Paramount ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, had always insisted on peaceful co-existence throughout his domain and Nigeria at large.\n\nOba Adesina expressed opposition to acts that can result in any threat to peace in Yorubaland and Nigeria, warning that in the event of any violence or war, the weak and vulnerable have always been the victims and the worst-hit.",

It is not about what we produce or what we do to get rich.\n\n\u201cToday, every youth wants to ride the best car but does not care about acquiring quality education.\u201d\n\nWhile making case for the diversification of economy, he said the nation needs to invest more in agriculture.\n\nALSO READ: Supreme Court didn\u2019t cede any of our lands to Erinle \u2014 Offa Community\n\nHe bemoaned the lack of quality leadership amongst Nigerian politicians, saying \u201cMembers of Houses of Assembly or Senate is just a way politicians pay those who are loyal to them.\n\n\u201cIn saner climes, Senators and members of Houses of Assembly are the incubators of ideas that move the nation forward.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think that members of our legislature have the intellectual capacity to generate bills that can move the nation forward or are prepared to employ assistants who have the ability to do same.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to task yourself and generate ideas that can move our nation forward because, if we carry on like this, we are facing extinction.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address, the chairman of the occasion and former Economic Adviser to a former President of Nigeria, Prof Osita Ogbu, said diversification of economy needs structural changes which entails moving from primary production to advanced technological production.\n\nHe also said that the processes involved require serious investments in science, technology and innovation, adding that diversification is a process of development because it is associated with economic freedoms that raises the economic power of workers which takes them out of poverty.\n\nThe don equally said that any economy which has not moved from primary production to advanced technological production would remain poor. He equally said that governments must encourage domestic production of goods to build a resilient economy.\n\nIn his address, the Publisher/Editor-in-Chief of The Starlite Newspapers, Harrison Ogara, who said that newspapers are facing most difficult times owing to the presence of social media and other factors, added that interpretative and investigative reporting, which are most of the time expensive and dangerous, have to be sustained by media professionals.\n\nHe equally urged state governments, especially, those with urgent herdsmen problem to collaborate to nip the issue in the bud.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

That was a dangerous insinuation; Christians are obedient people and are always ready to obey constituted authorities.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, we as leaders of CAN have mobilised our members to come out to take the vaccine. Last week, a team was at All Saints Methodist Church during the revival programme of the state chapter of the Christian Council of Nigeria (CCN) and today, we are here in Bishara Baptist Church.\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that there was initial apathy by people as a result of little education on the vaccine, Rev Dimeus said with proper education now, the people were ready and trooping out to take the vaccine.\n\nAccording to him, the vaccine was not harmful as many people had taken it and did not die, wondering why the Christian faithful should be afraid to take it.\n\nIn his words, the CAN chairman said, \u201cthere was initial apathy by the people because there was no proper education. But now that the people have been well educated and informed about the exercise, you can see them trooping out to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is not harmful; many people have taken it and they did not die. Why then should Christians be afraid to take it.\n\n\u201cWe have done enough mobilisation and our people are ready to take it because God has commanded us so to do.\u201d\n\nTalking about the turnout of Christians to take the vaccine, Dimeus said he was satisfied with how the faithful turned out for the vaccination.\n\nHe reiterated the fact that Christians in the state are ready for the vaccination exercise, assuring that whatever number of vaccines allocated for the exercise would be exhausted.\n\nThe CAN chairman then appealed to the general public in Bauchi State to not only embrace the COVID-19 vaccine but also come out en masse to take it, as, according to him, \u201cprevention is far better than looking for cure after infection\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is free for now, I am very sure that in the nearest future people will not get it even with their money. It is better to take it now,\u201d Rev Dimeus admonished.\n\nIt would be recalled that only recently seven intending Christian pilgrims from Bauchi State were prevented from going to Israel for their refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nCOVID-19 is real, take vaccine \u2013 CAN chairman tells Bauchi Christians",

He is indeed one of those whose wilful ignorance and misinterpretation of the law have fueled bitter emotions and hatred among pastoralists to embark on a killing spree of farmers in Benue State and other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe MACBAN national secretary is not new to contradictory statements. It is on record that he and other officials of the group visited Benue State in 2017 and after a meeting with Governor Samuel Ortom, addressed the media where they pledged support for the state\u2019s Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law.\n\n\u201cOn that occasion, Ngelzarma who spoke on behalf of the delegation, admitted that with their deeper knowledge of the law during their visit to Benue, it was now obvious to MACBAN that the legislation was indeed not targeted at Fulani or any other group. Their only appeal was for extension of the November 2017 deadline given for the commencement of implementation and enforcement of the law.\n\n\u201cThat the Miyetti Allah mouthpiece now goes to national television to kick against the same law they once described as \u2018a win-win for all\u2019 only proves that he is a merchant of crisis and one of those bent on truncating the peace building process in Benue and other states of the federation.\u201d\n\nAkase who noted that Miyetti Allah\u2019s anger towards Governor Samuel Ortom is well understood said it was expected that the Ngelzarma and his group would feel frustrated after the governor refused to accept their offer to betray his people and repeal the law in order to attract personal favours from their sponsors.\n\n\u201cMiyetti Allah groups have not hidden their evil agenda. They threaten farming communities and carry out such threats leaving hundreds dead, yet, they have the audacity to go to television studios and heap insults on victims of their carnage.\n\n\u201cThe question Ngelzarma and others who blame herdsmen\u2019s attacks and killings in Benue on the law fail to answer is: what is responsible for similar killings in states which have no laws on open grazing such as Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and Plateau,\u201d the statement queried.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nThe National Secretary, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Saleh Alhassan, an engineer, has said that the Anti-Open Grazing Law in the southern part of the country is a bargaining chip by the zone to secure favourable political negotiations ahead of 2023 elections.\n\nSaleh who posited that the law is not implementable disclosed that the association has already swung into action in a bid to protect their members and their businesses in the zone.\n\nHe spoke further in this interview.\n\nWhat is Miyetti Allah doing now to ensure your members do not run foul of the Anti-Open Grazing Law, which is spreading in the southern part of the country?\n\nWe are taking a number of actions as regards this development. Number one, we are taking legal action against the states both at local court and international court. We are equally applying political and spiritual solutions. We are already lobbying the National Assembly and the executive arm of the government to stop the governors. The National Assembly should perform its constitutional responsibility of protecting every citizen of this country, including the herdsmen and their business of herding. We are equally lobbying the executive arm of government to do the needful by creating options for the herders through budgetary allocations, creation of ministry for livestock and fishery. The National Assembly should pass the bill that has been there, lying fallow; these are the political options we are taking. And then, we are sending a very strong negotiating team to some of these governors because they may have been ill-informed about the security situations in their states. Let them look at the realities. There is no any space that cannot be governed in this country with GPR technology. We are equally exploring spiritual option that is why Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho are in jail while those sponsoring them are there in the hospital.\n\nOn what basis are you planning to challenge the action of the southern governors who have decided to save the economy and lives of the people in their respective states from criminal elements terrorizing their states?\n\nWe are going to challenge them on the basis of the violation of the fundamental human rights of our members as free citizens of this country- that is freedom of movement. We have this fundamental right protected by the constitution; by the African Charter of Human Rights to move freely and do our business freely as law-abiding citizens of this country. If movement is the same thing as inter-state commerce, you cannot legislate against inter-state commerce at the level of state Assembly; it is the jurisdiction of the National Assembly. You cannot deny us our freedom of movement and means of livelihood because that is protected by the constitution and the African Charter of Human and People\u2019s Rights.\n\nThis law came as a response to the effect of the activities of herders on the lives and the means of livelihood of the people of the South. How do you intend to react to this?\n\nIt is not true. Is there any case in the law court against the herders in those states? We have laws against trespass, how many of the cases are in the law court in this regard? How many cases have been declared against the herdsmen? It is mere propaganda. All these cases are cases of trespass. Where have they been accused of violating the law of trespass? There are existing laws against trespass. It is just propaganda to destroy our business. It is a policy that is meant to destroy our means of livelihood.\n\nWhy do you think the southerners are now moving against the Fulani herders whom they had lived together with for years if the allegation against them is mere propaganda as you posited?\n\nThe southerners are just playing bad politics because the president is a Fulani man. Their plan is to put pressure on his (President) people, which is wrong. The truth of the matter is that most of the cows in the South actually belong to merchants from Southern Nigeria. If you go to the bush there is nobody farming in the forest. The reality is that it is all propaganda. They are just hiding under this Anti-open Grazing Law probably because they want to score political point. Secondly, they may want to use it to steal security votes, loot the treasuries of the state. Thirdly, they want to deceive the people of their states \u2013 the masses in order not to be accountable to them.\n\nYou seem to suggest that the move is targeted at the president. If you would recall, the South voted overwhelmingly for the President, why do you now think they want to turn against the president?\n\nThat is probably because they are not getting favourable signals from their negotiation with him for 2023. So, they think by the time they mount pressure on his people, the herders, they will be able to get political commitments, which is wrong. They should go and discuss with their political peers and leave the herders to do their business.\n\nIf the cows in the South actually belong to southern merchants as you claim, don\u2019t you think the fight over the Anti-open Grazing Law should be between the southern merchants who own the cows and the governors in the region, not Miyetti Allah and the state governors in the South?\n\nThe law is not targeted at the southern merchants, but the herders. What they should do is to close the cattle market there if they don\u2019t want cattle business in the South. But if they make law against our people in the forest, that is what we will reject. Let them shut down all the abattoirs in the South. There is nothing they aim to achieve than to frustrate the Fulani. So, if they can shut down the abattoirs in the South then we will know that they are serious that they don\u2019t want cow in the South. Is there any grazing field in Rivers State? Is there any grazing field in Lagos and Bayelsa states? You must understand the ecology of these areas. If you see cow in any of these states, it is meant for abattoir. Yes, there are grazing areas in northern part of Ondo and part of Oyo; these are just few places we can say we have grazing areas. When they ganged up to make anti-grazing law we knew they were just playing politics. We are waiting to see how they will implement the anti-open grazing law. It is a satanic law; it\u2019s an empty law because it is not implementable. It is a law made without creating an option. They made law against grazing in their states, where are they going to graze their cows? If you are making a law you must make sure it is a law that can work; a law that promotes peace and ensures harmony in the society.\n\nDo you know what it costs to set up a ranch? You need nothing less than N4 million to ranch 20 cows. If you sell the entire 20 cows you can\u2019t make N4 million. The government should create the ranches then rent them out to us. But you don\u2019t create the ranches and you want to drive us, you cannot expect us to keep quiet. It is not possible. Do you think we will carry our cattle on our heads and leave the region? That is not possible. It\u2019s an empty law. Create places and tell us this is where we designate for you and state your conditions; tell us what we will pay as tax or fee then we take our cows and settle there. The governors are pretending as if they don\u2019t know what to. The truth is that they know they are just playing politics with it.\n\nNow that you have kicked against the Anti-open Grazing Law, how do you think the problem of herders going about with AK47, which they use for their nefarious activities, can be addressed?\n\nThe pictures of herders carrying AK47 on Internet are pictures from East Africa, they are pictures of the Masai. If you see anybody carrying AK 47 and the person is not following cows; he is a bandit and it is not our responsibility to identify bandits, it is the responsibility of the government. Go and see bandits who are terrorizing everybody in the bush. Their first victims are the herders because they rustle their cattle. A criminal is a criminal whether he is a Fulani man or a Yoruba man. So, why are you attaching his ethnicity to his infamous action? Do you attach the ethnic identities of the Southerners who are into Internet fraud to them when they are caught? Have you ever heard people say \u2018Yoruba ritualist? There is an agency against prostitution and human trafficking; do you attach the identity of Edo people who constitute 80 per cent offenders to these crimes? No, you don\u2019t that. There are criminals everywhere and in every community, so stop attaching ethnicity to crimes.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

So, we are still gathering the information on the number of states that have complied with that. While in some of the states, the Bill is at the stage of passage by the State House of Assembly but not yet signed into law, a state like Ekiti has signed the bill into law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe JUSUN scribe said that at the moment, the union is waiting to get the report of the NJC\u2019s monitoring committee before it can decide on the next line of action.\n\n\u201cAs of now, the NJC has written letters to all the state Chief Judges (CJs) and copied the state chairmen of JUSUN. The content of the letter is that they should furnish the NJC with information on the progress being made by the respective states on the implementation of the financial autonomy agreement,\u201d he added\n\nChairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State Governor, Fayemi and his deputy, Governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal had put their pen on paper on behalf of the 36 state governors on the historic agreement reached on May 20, to bring to an end a two-month industrial action embarked upon by JUSUN and PASAN.\n\nThe agreement, which was prepared on May 20 but signed on June 5, stipulates that all the states shall enact laws for the implementation of the financial autonomy of their judiciaries and legislatures, within 45 days of the signing of the agreement.\n\nThe 45 days expired on July 20, exactly 54 days ago.\n\nBefore the judicial workers embarked on the strike, President Muhammadu Buhari had issued Executive Order 10 for the implementation of this autonomy as enshrined in the Constitutions but the states defied the order.\n\nHowever, Lagos, Rivers, Bayelsa, and Plateau states claimed they had started the implementation of the financial autonomy.\n\nBayelsa State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Ayabaina Duba, told THISDAY at the weekend that the implementation of the financial autonomy started during the administration of the late Governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha.\n\nChairman of the Plateau State House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Peter Dasun told THISDAY at the weekend that the law had been enacted, while implementation had also commenced.\n\nBut the state Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Philip Longji told THISDAY that: \u201cFull implementation has not begun. What we have now is partial implementation.\u201d\n\nIn Ekiti State, the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye told THISDAY that Governor Fayemi had signed the Judicial and the Legislative Funds Management bills into laws to prepare propitious grounds for financial autonomy for the two arms.\n\nGovernor Okowa of Delta State has also signed into law the financial autonomy bills for the state legislature and the judiciary.\n\nIn Cross River State, the House of Assembly passed the Judiciary Funds Management Bill 2021, and the Legislature Funds Management Bill 2021 in the first week of July, while Governor Ayade signed the bills last week.\n\nIn Niger State, the lawmakers have passed the State Assembly Service Commission Bill, the Judiciary Fund Management Bill, and the Assembly Fund Management Bill but Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has not given his assent.\n\nThe Clerk of the House of Assembly, Alhaji Abdullahi Kagara confirmed the passage of the bills to THISDAY.\n\nIn Kebbi State, the Chairman of JUSUN, Comrade Umar Bawa told THISDAY that the state governor, Mr. Abubakar Atiku Bagudu has not signed the bill passed by the state lawmakers.\n\nThe Oyo State House of Assembly has also passed the Oyo State Judiciary and Oyo State House of Assembly Funds Management Bills, 2021, on July 15 but Governor Seyi Makinde has not signed the bills.\n\nThe Clerk of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Mr. Pius Udoh also told THISDAY at the weekend that the lawmakers have signed the bill, and are awaiting the assent of the state Governor Willie Obiano.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, the Kwara State branch Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Ibrahim Sambo told THISDAY that the bill was still before the state House of Assembly.\n\nThe Chairman of Enugu State House of Assembly\u2019s Committee on Information, Hon. Jeff Mba told THISDAY at the weekend that the lawmakers had prepared the necessary legislation and were awaiting the state government to set up the necessary commission for implementation.\n\nEbonyi State chapter of JUSUN and PASAN told THISDAY that the state government had started the process of setting up the State Accounts Allocation Committees (SAAC).\n\nThe State Chairman of JUSUN, Oko Nnachi, told THISDAY that the processes that would lead to the formation of the committee had started in the state.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Chairman of PASAN, Mrs. Uche Edene noted that the state had gradually started the implementation of the Financial Autonomy even before the strike started.\n\nShe noted that the state had enacted Fund Management Law in 2016 which gave birth to the State House of Assembly Commission.\n\nThe Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Hon Timothy Owoeye, told THISDAY through the Special Assistant on Media Affairs, Mr. Kunle Alabi that the Osun State Legislative Funds Management Bill 2021 and Osun State Judicial Funds Management Bill were passed recently and awaiting assent of Governor Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nThe Chairman of PASAN in Benue State, Mr. Joseph Adole told THISDAY that the state lawmakers had passed the bills but Governor Samuel Ortom has not given his assent.\n\nThe Nasarawa State House of Assembly last week passed the Assembly Financial Management Bill, waiting for Governor Abdullahi Sule\u2019s assent.\n\nChairman of the state House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Mohammed Omadefu, who disclosed this to THISDAY, added that the Judicial Financial Management Bill has scaled through the second reading in the house.\n\nIn Taraba State, the two bills seeking financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature have only passed the first readings in the state House of Assembly.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the Akwa Ibom State Legislative Fund Management Bill is still at the committee level and may be committed to a public hearing for further input, while the bill on the judiciary was yet to be sent to the House of Assembly for consideration.\n\nThe Chairman of the House Committee on Information and member representing Etinan State Constituency, Mr. Aniefiok Dennis confirmed this to THISDAY weekend.\n\nGovernors Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State were also yet to implement autonomy in their states.\n\nImo State Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Ernest Nnanebu, told THISDAY that the union was getting set for another round of strike.\n\nChairman of the PASAN in Edo State, Comrade Hassan Umaru Faruq told THISDAY that the state lawmakers have not done anything on the bills.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Disowns fake circular on social media\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has again dispelled speculations that it was planning to convert the foreign exchange (FX) in domiciliary accounts of bank customers into naira.\n\nThe apex bank has also disowned a fake circulation in social media circles, of a circular with its fake logo curiously dated \u2018September 13, 2021\u2019 and purportedly issued by it to the effect that all domiciliary account holdings are to be converted into naira.\n\nThe bank warned corporate bodies and the public against the use of the CBN\u2019s logo under any guise.\n\nThis is coming as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has commended the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele; the President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, and other recipients of awards at the 2020 Leadership Conference and Awards, held in Abuja over the weekend.\n\nThe clarification on dollar accounts came against the backdrop of false social media reports making the rounds that the apex bank had issued a circular to banks to \u201cconvert domiciliary account holdings into naira\u201d.\n\nHowever, CBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, in a statement yesterday insisted that the bank had not \u201ccontemplated, and will never contemplate, any such line of action\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe speculation is a completely false narrative aimed at triggering panic in the foreign exchange market.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that the bank had previously assured members of the public that there was no plan whatsoever to convert the foreign exchange in the domiciliary accounts of customers into naira to check purported shortage of availability of the United States dollars.\n\n\u201cOperators of domiciliary accounts and other members of the banking public are therefore advised to completely disregard these fictitious documents and malicious rumours, and go about their legitimate foreign exchange transactions, as we do not doubt that these rumours are only aimed at impugning the integrity of the CBN and activating chaos in the system.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that any circular issued by the apex bank would usually be posted on its website (www.cbn.gov.ng) for the attention of the public.\n\nThe bank further warned corporate bodies and members of the public against the unauthorised use of the CBN logo for any purpose whatsoever, adding that the attention of appropriate authorities had been drawn to this effect while culprits would be sanctioned accordingly.\n\nThe CBN said its attention had been drawn to a \u201cfake circulation, in social media circles, of a circular with a fake CBN logo curiously dated \u201813 September 2021\u2019, and purportedly issued by its Trade and Exchange Department to the effect that all Deposit Money Banks, International Money Transfer Operators (IMTOs) and members of the public are to convert domiciliary account holdings into naira\u201d.\n\nThe bank had earlier clarified that it does not intend to convert their dollar accounts into naira.\n\nOn August 2, the apex bank had refuted speculations that it was planning to convert customers\u2019 domiciliary accounts into naira.\n\nThe bank further assured members of the public that it would monitor the commercial banks to ensure they meet the legitimate FX demands of customers.\n\nIt had dismissed insinuations in some quarters that it planned to convert FX in the domiciliary accounts of customers into naira to check the purported shortage of availability of the dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, in his special remarks at The Leadership Awards event chaired by the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, Osinbajo commended the recipients for their respective leadership roles, which he said should serve as inspiration to other Nigerians, irrespective of origin or religion.\n\nWhile paying tribute to the late founder of Leadership Media Group, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah, who he described as a detribalised Nigeria, Osinbajo urged Nigerians to embrace peace and guard against actions capable of disintegrating the country.\n\nEchoing the views of the Vice president, the Sultan of Sokoto enjoined Nigerians to focus more on issues that bind the country together rather than dwell on those that threaten to divide the country.\n\nOn his part, Adesina urged the federal government to consider the economic investment as a way to address the spate of insecurity in the country instead of relying mainly on the military approach.\n\nTop of the list of awardees as joint Leadership Persons of the Year 2020 was the Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele; the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina; and the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum.\n\nIn a citation, the organisers said Emefiele was awarded the Leadership Person of the Year 2020 \u201cfor a lifestyle of service that held the economy and the nation together in the face of a monumental global crisis;

          "text": "\u2022Reduces entertainment expenses from N8.3bn to N1.3bn\n\n\u2022Spends N14.2bn on travels, transport\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) slashed the various fees collected by directors of the national oil company from N606 million in 2019 to N214 million in 2020, a THISDAY\u2019s analysis of the just-released Audited Financial Statement (AFS) for 2020 has shown.\n\nThis represents a 60.2 per cent reduction in directors\u2019 fees.\n\nTypically, directors\u2019 fees entail compensation for services as a member of the board of directors of the company, excluding reimbursement of expenses or other non-regular forms of compensation.\n\nIn all, the audited statement showed that in certain areas, the corporation did remarkably well in its avowed cost-cutting efforts during the year under review, while other administrative cost centres, gulped a substantial portion of the NNPC\u2019s finances.\n\nFollowing the economic downturn occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic last year, which led to the fall in oil prices, the NNPC said it was embarking on the internal restructuring of its operations, including shaving off unnecessary spending as well as automation of its processes.\n\n\u201cThe corporation saved a lot of cost through contract renegotiation by up to 30 per cent on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, introduction of technology that drastically cut travel cost through reduction in in-person meetings and the general automation of processes that enhanced efficiency across the group\u2019s businesses,\u201d Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, said last week.\n\nHe was speaking on how the NNPC made its first gain in 44 years, amounting to N287 billion in 2020.\n\nUnder general administrative expenses, although the NNPC paid N6.2 billion for rent and rates as opposed to N5 billion in 2019, it however reduced repairs and maintenance costs from N38 billion to N26.6 billion.\n\nSecurity expenses were reduced from N12.6 billion in 2019 to N12.3 billion, in 2020, while directors\u2019 fees were reduced from N606 million to N214 million, a slump of about 60 per cent.\n\nThe NNPC board is led by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, who doubles as the alternate chairman, assisted by Senator Magnus Abe, Dr. Tajudeen Umaru, Dr. Steven Dike, Mrs. Lami Ahmed, Chief Pius Akinyelure, Mallam Mohammed Lawal and Secretary of the Board, Mrs. Hadiza Coomassie, as well as the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance.\n\nFor general and administrative charges, the NNPC\u2019s bank charges increased from N370 million in 2019 to N845 million in 2020, exchange loss was N72 million, advertisement and publicity gulped N5.3 billion, up from N1.2 billion in 2019.\n\nIn addition, employee benefits expenses cost increased from N357 billion to N397 billion, donations rose from N279 million to N3.63 billion, audit fees rose from N1.040 to N1.07 billion, while entertainment expenses were slashed from N8.3 billion to N1.6 billion in the 2020 financial year.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, legal and professional fees paid by the corporation reduced from N30 billion to N24 billion while printing and stationery came down from N1.6 billion to N976 million.\n\nStaff training and recruitment cost slumped from N12.8 billion to N7.5 billion in the year under review and what the corporation termed management and facilitation fees increased from N1.3 billion to N5.6 billion.\n\nHowever, the document revealed that transport and travelling gulped N13.5 billion in 2019 and N14.2 billion in 2020, a year marked by travel restrictions as countries embarked on lockdown due to the pandemic, even as postages and telephone expenses which consumed N8.5 billion in 2019, dropped to N5.6 billion in 2020.\n\nOffice running cost jumped from N11 million to N83 million, while under the subheading other expenses, which included Nigerian content expenses, business development expenses, decoration and beautification expenses, the amount spent was reduced from N53.2 billion to N26.6 billion.\n\nSimilarly, NNPC paid N94 billion as pensions in 2020, up from N90 billion in 2019 and gratuity costs decreased from N51 billion to N46 billion in 2020. Cumulatively, the NNPC spent N678.171 on general and administrative expenses, a reduction from N695.949 in 2019.\n\nThe AFS stated that the share of loss of NNPC in Nikorma Transport and West Africa LPG, the corporation\u2019s shipping and transportation company engaged in transportation of energy products, was not recognised since the accumulated share of loss was higher than the initial investment.\n\nIn terms of monies from contracts, revenue from crude oil sales was N828 billion in 2020 as opposed to N1.0 trillion in 2019; revenue from petroleum product sales was N2.2 trillion in 2020, from a high of N2.9 trillion in 2019, sales of natural gas increased from N489 billion in 2019 to N524 billion in 2020 while monies from services rendered decreased from N144 billion to N89 billion in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\nIn all, group revenues from the above items for the group, decreased from N4.6 trillion in 2019 to N3.7 trillion in 2020, according to the document.\n\nOn a sectorial basis, Nigerian Gas Company (NGC), one of the NNPC\u2019s subsidiaries established in 1988, spent N31.88bn on salaries, welfare and other personnel expenses in 2020 and generated N109.1 billion in 2020, representing a 21 per cent increase from N90.2 billion in 2019.\n\nThe company\u2019s profit before tax also increased by 19 per cent from N54.7 billion in 2019 to N65.1 billion in 2020, while profit after tax also rose by 20 per cent to N52.7 billion from N43.7 billion in the preceding year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The invitation for questioning of the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund (NPTF), Suleiman Abba and five others by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) may soon have a new twist as top government office holders are pushing to have the matter swept under the carpet.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier published a report, along with documents showing the ICPC had invited the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the NPTF, Abba and five others over fraudulent activities, including alleged procurement of substandard equipment by the NPTF for the police.\n\nSenator Aliyu Wamakko; Former Police Inspector-General Suleiman Abba and; Attorney-General of the Federation Abubakar Malami.\n\nAbba is also a former Inspector-General of Police.\n\nThe information is contained in a letter dated September 6, 2021, addressed to the Executive Secretary of the NPTF and signed by the Director of Operations of the ICPC, Akeem Lawal.\n\nAccording to the letter titled, \u2018Investigation Activities: Letter of Invitation Pursuant to Section 28(1(A-B) of ICPC Act 2000\u2019, the anti-graft agency is asking the former IGP and others to appear before it between Monday, September 13 and Thursday, September 16, 2021.\n\nA copy of the letter obtained by SaharaReporters on Saturday revealed that they will be investigated for alleged violation of the provisions of the ICPC Act No. 5 of 2020.\n\nThe ICPC has been investigating alleged procurement of substandard equipment by NPTF officials.\n\nDOCUMENTS: Former @PoliceNG Inspector-General, Suleiman Abba, Others Invited By Anti-graft Commission For Grilling Over Fraud In Nigeria Police Trust Fund | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/ilyAFp65Z5 pic.twitter.com/jvsGswUn2f \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) September 12, 2021\n\nIn the letter obtained by SaharaReporters, those invited for questioning are identified as: IGP Suleiman Abba (rtd), Board Chairman; Mrs Victoria Ojogbane, Director, Legal Services; Alhaji Yahaya Mohammed, Director, Planning, Research and Statistics; Mr. Lawal Gunjunju, Director, Finance and Account; Mr. Salihu Abubakar, Special Assistant, Technical; Dr. Fred Femi Akinfala, Director, Human Resources and General Services; Mr. Ben Akabueze, Board Member; and Engr. Mansur Hammed, Board Member.\n\nAkabueze is the Director-General, Budget Office of the Government of Nigeria. He was before now the Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning in Lagos State in the administration of Babatunde Fashola.\n\nHowever, a top source on Sunday told SaharaReporters that the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence and Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, Senator Aliyu Wamakko have been making moves to ensure the matter is swept under the carpet because of their relationship with some of the invited persons.\n\nAccording to the source, as the Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, Senator Wamakko, also a former Governor of Sokoto State, has forged a relationship with the heads of the country\u2019s anti-graft agencies and knows how to lean on them for favours.\n\nSenator Aliyu Wamakko\n\n\u201cI understand that Senator Wamakko, who was the governor of Sokoto State and the vice chairman of the committee on anti-corruption and financial crimes, which oversees the ICPC and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has promised to kill the matter.\n\n\u201cI also understand that the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) has also spoken to the chairman of the ICPC (Prof Bolaji Owasanoye) to mellow the thing down (soften the commission\u2019s stance on the alleged fraud),\u201d the source said.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nIt was discovered that some of the equipment the NPTF recently donated to the police was inferior.\n\nThe NPTF had recently donated operational vehicles and other equipment worth N11 billion to the police as the NPTF for the training and retraining of police personnel.\n\nSome of the said equipment included 640 bullet proof vests, 120 buffalo vans, and 190 ballistic helmets but the equipment was said to be substandard.\n\nFor instance, it was learnt that the bullet proof vests are supposed to have resistant shields in the front and back but they only have protective shields in the front. Therefore, the bullet proofs will fail to effectively protect police personnel during shoot-outs with criminal elements like Boko Haram terrorists, bandits or robbers.\n\nIn the letter obtained by SaharaReporters, the ICPC specifies the different times each of the six invited persons is expected to come in for questioning.\n\nThe former IGP, Suleiman is expected to come in for questioning at exactly 1pm on Thursday, September 16, 2021; Ojogbane is expected in by 10am on Monday, September 13, 2021; Mohammed is expected in by 1pm on Monday, September 13, 2021, while Gunjunju is expected in the ICPC office for questioning by 10am on Tuesday, September 14, 2021.\n\nAlso, Abubakar is expected in for questioning by 1pm on Tuesday, September 14, 2021; Akinfala is expected in by 10am on Wednesday, September 15, 2021; Akabueze is expected in by 1pm on Wednesday, September 15, 2021 while Hammed is expected in by 10am on Thursday, September 16, 2021.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cSimilarly, the invited staff is to come with the following documents as applicable to their office and schedule as well as the original copies for sighting:\n\n\u201cCopies of all payment vouchers for overhead, recurrent and capital for year 2020 and 2021, copies of all contract agreement for contracts awarded from the takeoff grant and capital, copies of staff nominal roll, comprehensive list of staff on transfer, posting and secondment.

Mansur Hammed, Board Member.\n\nAkabueze is the Director-General, Budget Office of the Government of Nigeria. He was before now the Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning in Lagos State in the administration of Babatunde Fashola.\n\nHowever, a top source on Sunday told SaharaReporters that the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence and Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, Senator Aliyu Wamakko have been making moves to ensure the matter is swept under the carpet because of their relationship with some of the invited persons.\n\nAccording to the source, as the Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, Senator Wamakko, also a former Governor of Sokoto State, has forged a relationship with the heads of the country\u2019s anti-graft agencies and knows how to lean on them for favours.\n\nSenator Aliyu Wamakko\n\n\u201cI understand that Senator Wamakko, who was the governor of Sokoto State and the vice chairman of the committee on anti-corruption and financial crimes, which oversees the ICPC and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has promised to kill the matter.\n\n\u201cI also understand that the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) has also spoken to the chairman of the ICPC (Prof Bolaji Owasanoye) to mellow the thing down (soften the commission\u2019s stance on the alleged fraud),\u201d the source said.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nIt was discovered that some of the equipment the NPTF recently donated to the police was inferior.\n\nThe NPTF had recently donated operational vehicles and other equipment worth N11 billion to the police as the NPTF for the training and retraining of police personnel.\n\nSome of the said equipment included 640 bullet proof vests, 120 buffalo vans, and 190 ballistic helmets but the equipment was said to be substandard.\n\nFor instance, it was learnt that the bullet proof vests are supposed to have resistant shields in the front and back but they only have protective shields in the front. Therefore, the bullet proofs will fail to effectively protect police personnel during shoot-outs with criminal elements like Boko Haram terrorists, bandits or robbers.\n\nIn the letter obtained by SaharaReporters, the ICPC specifies the different times each of the six invited persons is expected to come in for questioning.\n\nThe former IGP, Suleiman is expected to come in for questioning at exactly 1pm on Thursday, September 16, 2021; Ojogbane is expected in by 10am on Monday, September 13, 2021; Mohammed is expected in by 1pm on Monday, September 13, 2021, while Gunjunju is expected in the ICPC office for questioning by 10am on Tuesday, September 14, 2021.\n\nAlso, Abubakar is expected in for questioning by 1pm on Tuesday, September 14, 2021; Akinfala is expected in by 10am on Wednesday, September 15, 2021; Akabueze is expected in by 1pm on Wednesday, September 15, 2021 while Hammed is expected in by 10am on Thursday, September 16, 2021.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cSimilarly, the invited staff is to come with the following documents as applicable to their office and schedule as well as the original copies for sighting:\n\n\u201cCopies of all payment vouchers for overhead, recurrent and capital for year 2020 and 2021, copies of all contract agreement for contracts awarded from the takeoff grant and capital, copies of staff nominal roll, comprehensive list of staff on transfer, posting and secondment.

When we opened an office in Nigeria in 1994, the most important consideration was its potential strategic role in the world: the people, population size, role in the region, youthful population, level of education and its economy,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe these considerations are still important in 2021. Of course, there have been ups and downs since 1994, but the foundation is not na\u00efve to believe that everything will be hunky-dory. For example, during the military rule of Sani Abacha, many development partners closed shop. But the foundation remained in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur commitment and passion was and is to the Nigerian people. We were witnesses to history and stood by the Nigerian people. Your best friend stands with you when you are most vulnerable and weak.\u201d\n\nShettima added that the foundation has faced a few challenges in Nigeria, but said they are not considered major unless contextualised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe director said since 1986, the foundation has invested over $300 million in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe categorise our support into two: organisations and individuals based in Nigeria, and organisations and individuals that are not based in Nigeria, but have activities in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBetween 1986 and 2021, in the first category, we have supported 713 individuals and organisations to the amount of $216.7 million and in the second category, we have supported 233 individuals and organisations to the amount of $123.4 million.\u201d\n\nThe director also said Nigerians, and the strategic importance of the country in the continent and the world, provide motivation for the investments in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI may have an exaggerated view of Nigeria, but I think the fate of the black race is tied to Nigeria and vice versa. We also consider the growth, vitality and diversity of civil society groups,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe relative independence and strength of the media are important factors.

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nTransforming informal recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the ASEAN region is one of the highest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt scale, our solution cuts across every developing nation and we\u2019re building in a way that it can be implemented everywhere.\u201d\n\nArewa is also looking to promote a recycling culture among Nigerians, which would significantly increase the amount of waste collected, as the current volume recovered falls short of the demand for recyclables. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not able to meet the demand for recyclables, which is why expanding the collection network and producer sensitisation are extremely important over the next few months.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s population is estimated to double by 2050; that\u2019s most likely to result in more solid waste hanging around and more items for recycling. As Scrapays\u2019 collectors move around streets fulfilling pick-up requests, the startup\u2019s low-tech, high-impact solution is addressing health, poverty, and urban resilience issues in Africa\u2019s largest country, one city at a time.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Nigerian states have grown increasingly dependent on the Federal Government for revenue since the economic crisis of 1979\u20131980, not minding it contradicted true fiscal federalism.\n\nThat is however only one part of the problem, the more contentious issue is that the revenue allocation system in Nigeria can neither be said to be efficient nor equitable.\n\nStates that contribute the bulk of revenue to the central pool do not get the largest share of revenue under the current sharing system.\n\nLagos, Nigeria\u2019s wealthiest state and economic capital, for instance, is said to contribute 55 percent of Value Added Taxes (VAT), a major contributor to the consolidated revenue fund in the country.\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria generated N1.53 trillion in VAT, about 10 percent of the country\u2019s entire revenue that year.\n\nRead Also: States expected to win, lose if VAT sharing formula changes\n\nWith import VAT contributing 51 percent, local VAT in the period was N763 billion. If Lagos state\u2019s 55 percent contribution is factored into local VAT, then it implies the state contributed about N400 billion to the VAT pool last year.\n\nYet, the state\u2019s total federal allocation, which includes VAT, was only N115.93 billion. Little wonder Lagos is pushing to have VAT control wrested from the Federal Government.\n\nThe FCT can also feel hard done by. The second largest contributor to VAT after Lagos only gets 1 percent of VAT revenue.\n\nIn some cases, states that contribute less to the VAT pool often walk away with a larger share than their contributions.\n\n\u201cThe current VAT revenue sharing formula among states is not equitable,\u201d says Taiwo Oyedele, fiscal policy partner and Africa tax leader.\n\n\u201cThis inequity can be addressed by allocating any domestic VAT collected from each state entirely to the respective state.\n\n\u201cOnly VAT collected on imports, international services and inter-state transactions should be paid into the VAT pool and shared based on derivation,\u201d Oyedele states.\n\nThe lack of equity in the federal allocation system is why states are now pushing for the first time to enact laws that give them the right to collect VAT within their jurisdictions.\n\nSince a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt ruled last month that states, and not the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), should be collecting VAT and Personal Income Tax (PIT), some states have been keen to use the landmark ruling as a precursor to push for true fiscal federalism.\n\nIn the latest development, Lagos has passed legislation giving it power to wrest the Federal Government\u2019s control of VAT.\n\nLagos is convinced that being in charge of VAT collection would lead to increase in revenue and increase in infrastructure development in the state.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with fiscal federalism that we have been talking about,\u201d Mudashiru Obasa, speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, said.\n\nLagos says its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) could top N1 trillion if it takes responsibility for collecting VAT, a N400 billion addition to its IGR last year.\n\nOn the flipside, however, Lagos could lose claim to some VAT if it is decentralised. This is because some companies with sales across the country will no longer pay all their VAT to Lagos.\n\nTo deliver equity for all states, an economist who spoke with BusinessDay recommends that the taxes are shared based on origination. For instance, sharia states who do not allow consumption of alcohol should not get any share of alcohol taxes while the states where it is allowed keep all the value added taxes that accrue from alcohol consumption.\n\nIf the contentious issue of equity is resolved, the states may be more open to weigh lessons from India, which tried to decentralise VAT but was forced back to the drawing board after the move backfired.\n\nDespite the stiff resistance by the FIRS, which collects taxes on behalf of the Federal Government, the states, particularly Rivers and Lagos, are however not stopping at wanting to collect VAT.\n\nThe battle ground is shifting to the collection of stamp duties after the 36 states instituted legal action against the Federal Government over its continued collection of stamp duties in the country.\n\nThe states in a suit filed last month at the Supreme Court are claiming that the right to collect stamp duties on financial transactions between persons or individuals in a state is the exclusive right of the states; hence the apex court should intervene and restrain the Federal Government from further collection of the money.\n\nThey are asking for a refund of N176 billion as stamp duties collected between 2015 and 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is great to see the states finally pushing for true fiscal federalism,\u201d a development economist told BusinessDay.\n\nStates, it is argued, need some financial autonomy if they are to contribute to national development and reduce their decades-old dependence on federal handouts.\n\n\u201cIt also forces the states that contribute little to the federal purse but are very dependent on federal allocations to raise their game,\u201d the development economist, who did not want to be named, said.",

          "text": "In four charts, why Nigerian states need more fiscal autonomy\n\nThe journey to true fiscal federalism in Nigeria took a bold leap last month after a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt ruled that the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) should not be responsible for collecting VAT in Rivers State.\n\nThe Port Harcourt ruling came at a time when states had been clamouring for more resource control in a bid to have more economic control over their affairs as Abuja faces dwindling revenue and higher debt service ratios.\n\nData compiled by BusinessDay show why states must wake up, challenge the status quo and the government on true fiscal federalism.\n\nPoor IGR may cripple 8 states if FG allocation stops\n\nAn Annual States Viability Index (ASVI) sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) comparing the IGR of each state with its Federation Account Allocations (FAA) shows that eight states have a poor IGR of less than 10 percent.\n\nStates generate IGR through Pay-As-You-Earn Tax (PAYE), Direct Assessment, Road Taxes and revenues from Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nRead Also: Here are the top five states with the highest foreign investment in 2017\n\nFor instance, Bayelsa State received a combined total of N152 billion from the Federation Account Allocation (FAA) in 2020, however the state was only able to generate an IGR of N12 billion, which means the state generated 8 percent of total amount received from the federation account.\n\nWhat this simply means is that Bayelsa with its oil-production advantage cannot survive without the federal allocation.\n\nOther states that cannot survive without federal allocations include Jigawa, Katsina, Adamawa, Yobe, Niger and Taraba, whose IGR are all less than 10 percent of the federal allocations they receive.\n\nLagos, five other states generate more IGR than 30 states combined\n\nData compiled by BusinessDay also show IGR of Lagos State of N418 billion is higher than that of 22 other states put together whose IGR are extremely low and poor compared with their allocations from the Federation Account.\n\nLagos remained steadfast in its number one position in IGR among the states with a total revenue generation of N418 billion compared with Federal Allocation of N115.93 billion, which translated to 139 percent in the 12 months of 2020.\n\nIt is followed by Rivers State that generated IGR of N117 billion compared with its allocation of N198 billion, representing 58 percent; Ogun with N50 billion compared with allocation of N88 billion, representing 57 percent; Kaduna with N50 billion compared with allocation of N124 billion, representing 40 percent; Oyo with IGR of N38 billion compared with allocation of N127 billion, representing 29.7 percent, and Anambra generated N28 billion compared with allocation of N94 billion, representing 29.6percent.\n\nThe total IGR of the six most viable states in 2020 at N695 billion was more than the entire IGR collected by the remaining 30 states put together, which was less than N508.5 billion.\n\nUneven economic distribution in regions\n\nData from NBS also show an uneven economic distribution among Nigeria\u2019s geographical region led by the South West.\n\nFollowed closely by the oil-rich South-South region of N263.2 billion while North Central, North West, South East, and North East regions recorded IGR of N181.6 billion, N146.7 billion, N96.7 billion and N56.8 billion, respectively.\n\nMost analysts say the reason for the skewed and uneven economic distribution is because of the low level of commercial activities in the Northern part of the region unlike other regions.\n\nLate last year, Boko Haram terrorists invaded farmlands in a village in Borno State and massacred over 67 farmers. In many other parts of the North, activities of bandits and terrorists have scared farmers out of their farms.\n\nUnequal VAT distribution\n\nEfforts by BusinessDay to track the latest data of how much VAT was distributed and generated by states proved abortive due to lack of public data. However, Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, shared some insights on how VAT was distributed for the month of June, a situation that reflect the current discordant tunes over resource allocation.\n\nAccording to Wike, Rivers generated N15 billion VAT revenue in June this year, but got N4.7 billion in return, while Kano generated N2.8 billion in the same month and got the same N2.8 billion back.\n\nThe governor also said N46.4 billion was collected from Lagos State in the same month but the Federal Government gave Lagos N9.3 billion.",

This is according to the biotech firm\u2019s two top executives.\n\nAccording to the chief medical officer, Oezlem Tuereci, over the next few weeks, the firm will file the results of its trial in five to 11-year-olds with regulators across the world and will request approval of the vaccine in this age group.\n\nTuereci also mentioned that the final production steps to bottle a lower-dose pediatric version of its Comirnaty vaccine is underway which is currently approved for adults and youngsters at least 12 years of age.\n\nThe firm has said it intends to file its regulatory dossier on the 5- to 11-year-olds this September and also laid out plans to seek approval in children aged 6 months to 2 years later this year.\n\nModerna, however, has said that a trial testing its shot in children between six and 11 years has now been fully enrolled. The Pharmaceutical firm also assured that it was working on the best dosage in another study involving infants as young as six months.\n\nChile, as well, which has relied heavily on Sinovac\u2019s shot, this month approved the use of the vaccine in children over 6 years of age.\n\nRead also: VAT, anti-open grazing laws push Nigeria closer to fiscal federalism\n\nOil price market outlook\n\nOil prices dropped by about $1 on Monday, extending previous losses after the world\u2019s top exporter Saudi Arabia slashed crude contract prices for Asia over the week ending September 11, reflecting well-supplied global markets and concerns over the outlook for demand.\n\nIraq and Total Energies have signed a $27billion contract to deepen oil, gas, and solar investment in Iraq. The Iraqi oil minister, Ihsan Abdul Jabbar, said the deal was also to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nThe head of Russia\u2019s Lukoil Company said oil prices at $65-$75 were comfortable for the market and OPEC+ is striving to maintain that price range by regulating output.\n\nOPEC+ at the first Ministerial Roundtable on Energy, Climate, and Sustainable Development canvassed for a different approach in tackling climate change in developing countries.\n\nOil prices grew towards $73 a barrel on Friday, supported by growing signs of supply tightness in the United States as a result of Hurricane Ida and as U.S.-China trade hopes gave riskier assets a boost.\n\nBoth Brent and WTI benchmarks had weekly declines of -0.16% and -0.03% WoW respectively.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to gain slightly as the US Gulf of Mexico production comes on stream and President Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate strengthens economic recovery. Oil prices may also be supported by the Chinese oil auction which was aimed at stabilising oil prices.\n\nThe oil market in the coming week will be looking out for OPEC and the International Energy Agency\u2019s oil demand outlook for 2022 against the spread or containment of the Delta variant of COVID-19.\n\nGold prices drifted lower amid rising dollar\n\nYellow metal prices fell at the start of the week, but they remained below a two-and-a-half-month high.\n\nA disappointing U.S. jobs report raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve might delay asset tapering, which boosted the price of gold.\n\nDuring the previous session, gold futures reached $1,833.80, their highest level since Jun. 16, before declining 0.30% to $1,828.25 early Monday.\n\nDespite Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll report showing 235,000 jobs gained in August, investors are still digesting Friday\u2019s report. Investors now expect the Fed to take a bit longer to begin asset tapering, given the economy\u2019s smallest gains in 7 months and the demand for assets.\n\nThe Dollar Index, which moves inversely to gold, also fell after the report. The dollar rose on Monday.\n\nAs part of their respective policy decisions, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank will make announcements on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nAs gold prices bounced back in the previous week, physical gold demand was comparatively muted in Asian hubs. There are, however, tentative hopes that Indian festivals will boost demand this year.\n\nData provided by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that COMEX gold and silver net long positions were increased by speculators in the week ended Aug. 31.\n\nA steady price for silver was maintained at $24.69 per ounce. In the previous session, the price increased 3.4%, the largest percentage rise since early May. The platinum price fell 0.6%, while palladium gained 0.2%.\n\nGold depreciated by -1.96% while Silver also dropped by -3.31% W-o-W.\n\nNational Bureau of Statistics data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\n\u00b7 Monday 13th September 2021: Q2, 2021 Terms of Trade Report & Social Statistics Report 2020\n\n\u00b7 Tuesday 14th September 2021: Nigerian Domestic and Foreign Debt (Q2, 2021) & Rail Transportation Data (Q1 & Q2, 2021)\n\n\u00b7 Wednesday 15th September 2021: CPI and Inflation Report August 2021\n\n\u00b7 Thursday 16th September 2021: Automative Gas Oil (DIESEL) Price watch August 2021, National Household Kerosene Watch, August 2021 & Premium Motor Spirit (PETROL) Price watch August 2021.\n\n\u00b7 Friday 17th September 2021: Liquefied Petroleum Gas (COOKING GAS) Price watch August 2021, Selected Food Prices August 2021 & Transport Fare watch August 2021.\n\nCurrency market\n\nThe Naira continued its fall against major currencies last week, both at the BDC market and I & E FX Window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the domestic currency fell slightly by +0.12% on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis to N412.00/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.\n\nAt the BDC market, it closed at US$/N547 depreciating by +3.60% against the US dollar, against the British pound it also fell by +3.47% to close at Pound/N745, and against the Euro by+2.58% to close at Euro/N635.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N412.00 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.29.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney market\n\nFor most of the trading session last week, money market rates were in single digit, this was supported by robust system liquidity.\n\nAt the close of the session on Friday, funding rates increased which was propelled by PMA. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 14.00% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 14.50% indicating a W-o-W rise of +7.69%for OBB and +7.14% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any inflow.\n\nTreasury bills market\n\nThe bills market was largely bearish last week, with attention skewed towards the PMA that held in the week.\n\nAt the close of the market last week, average benchmark yields for T-bills rose by +6.54% to 4.91%, OMO bills were up by +1.64% W-o-W to close at 6.12% while CBN\u2019s special bills dipped by -2.23%.\n\nActivity next week is expected to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and Eurobond Market\n\nThe FGN bond market sustained its mixed trend last week, with buying interest seen at the short and long-dated instruments, while investors went long for the mid-tenor notes. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 8.26% for the week which fell slightly by W-o-W by -0.66%.\n\nThe Eurobond market was relatively bearish for the entire week, with buying interests seen across the board. Access Bank is set to issue a 5-year Fixed Rate USD Senior Unsecured Note. The bank currently has a 5-year Eurobond which was issued on the 19th of October 2016.\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to remain soft as inflation concerns continue to linger.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a negative note as the performance was bearish. The NGXASI closed the week with a decline of -0.86%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N176.75 bn, year-to-date return moderated to -3.35%, while the market capitalization settled at N20.28trillion.\n\nThe volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange this week grew by +6.55% and +51.14% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was mixed last week as the NGX Oil and Gas was the highest gainer for the week with +2.28% while NGX Insurance was the highest loser with -3.39%. NGX Consumer Goods closed positive with +0.18%, NGX-IND remained flat while NGX Banking closed negative with -0.19.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed negative with 25 gainers led by OANDO and FTNCOCOA as against 34 losers led by CORNERST and UPDC",

So it is very nice when you see people trying to be creative and doing things differently.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI want more Nigerians to open their eyes and start thinking of themselves, they should embrace entrepreneurship, it is very important.\n\n\u201cI just pray that a lot of people will just take cue from what she has\n\ndone and try to start their own business even if it is small.\n\n\u201cWe do not know where God will take you but all you need to do is to\n\nstart something. We all must start somewhere and I\u2019m sure when you\n\nstart something it will manifest big.\u201d\n\nHajiya Malami stated that the Grand Eatery Restaurant is going to be wonderful in serving Nigerian and continental dishes.\n\nThe former first lady advised the CEO of Grand Eatery to always make sure that the place is kept clean and also sell at a pocket friendly prices.\n\nIn her remarks, the CEO, Grand Eatery Restaurant, Hajiya Fatima\n\nIbrahim Yakubu explained that right from when she was young, she loves\n\ncooking and because of that she went into bakery for nine years but did not get the satisfaction she wanted and decided\n\nto try what she love most which is a cooking.\n\nShe said, \u201cI wish everybody have the means to set up a place so that they can assist people.\n\n\u201cNow I have about 48 workers I must support every month.\n\n\u201cIt is so amazing that when I was doing the interview the first 40\n\npeople that came, only one was a secondary school graduate, the remaining 39 were degree holders and even some have second degrees but they do not have jobs for 10-12 years.\n\n\u201cI always want to encourage women, if you have the opportunity that you can do something to empower people, it is just another way of giving back to the society.\u201d",

          "text": "THE All Progressives Congress, APC and All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, in Anambra State are trading words over the weekend\u2019s gruesome murder of the deposed traditional ruler of Mkpunado in Anambra East local government area, Igwe Alex Edozieuno and his driver, Chukwuemeka.\n\nBoth were killed by unknown gunmen while driving home and the incident has been generating so much controversy in the state. The late Edozieuno was dethroned by his community last year and another traditional ruler installed in the area following his suspension by the state government. He recently joined APC and was said to have been attending meetings of the party before his death.\n\nAddressing reporters in Awka following the murder of the party chieftain, the director general of APC campaign council in the state, Chief Paul Chukwuma and the party\u2019s state chairman, Chief Basil Ejidike described the murder as one too many.\n\nChukwuma said: \u201cA very sad event took place in our dear state last weekend. We woke up weekend with the devastating news of the assassination of the former traditional ruler of Mkpunando, Igwe Alex Edozieuno. He was the traditional ruler of the community before he was dethroned by the state government some time last year..\n\n\u201cWhy his death is a major concern to us is because we consider it a politically motivated killing and we wonder why any citizen of the state could indulge in such act. Recall that few weeks ago, the late traditional ruler joined in a public function organized by our party, the APC, and his reception into our party took place in his home town and it was attended by many people.\n\n\u201cWe therefore wonder why there should be this murder, especially against the backdrop of the incessant threats the members of the APC are receiving from the ruling APGA government. We have been receiving death threats from highly placed individuals in the state.\n\n\u201cAs usual in Anambra State, political contest has never got to the point where people\u2019s lives will be in issue. With this death, we felt we should speak out. We are calling on the law enforcement agencies \u2013 the police, the DSS to quickly move into action and conduct a proper investigation since the threats have now started translating to deaths.\n\n\u201cOur resolve to salvage Anambra State as stakeholders in the state remains unshaken. Recently, six members of APGA in the state House of Assembly joined our party and each of them has been receiving threats.\n\n\u201cWe could have swept it under the carpet but with the way and manner Chief Edozieuno was killed a few kilometers away from his home, we wonder why we should be in this situation in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cThe story out there is that APC is not on ground and that APC wants to take Anambra from the top. That is why this time around, our party decided to do something different in Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to engage in Ndi Anambra, realizing that we cannot take the mandate of the people by force; we decided to reach out to the grassroots to explain to them our predicaments in the hands of these people that have held the state hostage\u201d.\n\nReacting on the allegation, the state Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr. C Don Adinuba said it was unfortunate that APC was politicizing the death of the former traditional ruler.\n\nAdinuba said: \u201cIt is important to remind some politicians that it is callous to attempt to politicize the death of any person. To allege that the murders were preceded by threats and text messages without proof is preposterous.\n\n\u201cRather than politicize the ex-monarch\u2019s death, the APC should provide whatever it has about the crime to the Nigeria Police Force. After all, the APC is the Federal Government party which controls not just the police force, but also the Department of State security.\n\n\u201cThe people and Government of Anambra State are satisfied with the action of the new Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Tony Olofu, who personally went to the crime scene immediately he heard of Chief Ezediuno\u2019s unfortunate death and set in motion the machinery to arrest the persons responsible for the murder and their motive.\n\nAnambra people are proud that their state has in the last seven years become the most peaceful in the whole country. The level of social harmony we enjoy is unprecedented since the state was created 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe last two major elections in the state were the most peaceful in the country, with practically no incidents. Every Anambra person has a moral responsibility to make the November 6 gubernatorial election in the state equally peaceful.\n\n\u201cDespite the machination of some politicians who are allergic to peace, order and enlightened values, the people of Anambra State are committed to a culture of harmonious living\u201d.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Katsina Chapter has distanced itself from the recent unguarded outburst credited to its National Scribe, Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe Chairman of the Katsina State, Miyetti Allah, Alh. Hassan Kuraye, condemned the unguided utterances about Governor Masari by their National Secretary, would necessitate the National Chairman and executive members to visit Katsina to seek for Governor\u2019s forgiveness over the derogatory remarks.\n\nAt a press briefing held at the NUJ Secretariat on Friday, the state chairman condemned the unguarded derogatory statement of the National Secretary, saying it does not in any way reflect the view of the association at both the national and state chapter.\n\n\u201cWe request to have your indulgence this morning to make some issues clear as far as the relationship between Miyetti Allah Hore and the Katsina Government is concerned.\n\n\u201cOne of us, the national secretary of Miyetti Allah, cattle Hore, Alhassan Saleh, made some negative utterances against His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, which were found so heavy to the entire Fulani race across the landscape of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe National Secretariat of Miyetti Allah Hore has already distanced itself from those negative utterances made by Alhassan Saleh, and we felt it is imperative for us as the state chapter of the Miyetti Allah Hore to align ourselves with the National Secretariat of our noble union and distance ourselves equally.\n\n\u201cAs such, we felt it will be important for us to make ourselves clear on those utterances. He made the utterances on his own,, and he is standing alone as far as we are concerned.\n\n\u201cHe has shown some signs of remorse when he was contacted by the national chairman,\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Bello Masari, please forgive and forget those utterances because we are law-abiding citizens of this country. Miyetti Allah cattle Hore is a registered and law-abiding association.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman of Miyetti Allah Hore is coming to Katsina personally with his Executives to plead with His Excellency to forgive and forget those negative utterances for us to continue to forge ahead, to continue to make some progress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot complete this press briefing without noticing some contribution made by His Excellency. Already you are aware that there\u2019s a standing committee for the relationship between herders and farmers in Katsina State, which is making a very comprehensive and very successful negotiation with the farmers where we have some cattle routes being encroached, and already they have been demarcated by the standing committee with the support of Katsina State Government.\n\nIn a nutshell, we are here to say that the utterances made by our national secretary are not good.\n\nAt least by the age of His Excellency and the position he is occupying, he deserves some respect so that the successes we have been recording, from the inception of this administration will continue to thrive.\n\nRecalled Alhassan Saleh recently granted an interview to Sahara Reporters to elicit his reactions on a recent interview Governor Masari granted to Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today\u2019 programme where the Governor stated that many of the bandits terrorizing the North are from Fulani extraction involved in cattle rearing,\n\nIn his response, Saleh painted the Katsina Governor in derogatory terms for daring to label the Fulani as being primarily responsible for banditry in the North.\n\nThe National Secretary, while urging Nigerians to ignore Masari\u2019s statement, throwing caution into the air, described Governor Masari as a confused drunkard.\n\n\u201cDid you take that drunkard serious? My governor, do you take him seriously? Can\u2019t you see that he is already tired? Records should come from security operatives, not confused human beings.\n\n\u201cAll of them talking, they are stealing security votes, they should find solutions, create ranches for these herders and accommodate them.\n\n\u201cWhich people do you find along the Sahel Sahara desert? They are many tribes, is it by a physique that you now identify a Fulani man? The bandits are criminals, why should you attach a tribe to it? That\u2019s why we are not happy. You don\u2019t need to attach a tribe because it will affect an innocent person.\n\n\u201cForget that man, that man is the worst Governor Katsina has had; we are just praying for his time to lapse.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Katsina State chapter Chairman of Miyetti Allah, Alh. Hassan Kuraye said that the National Secretary has since regretted his actions.",

          "text": "Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu has said the comprehensive approach to resolving current Nigeria\u2019s challenges is through confronting adult illiteracy and paying attention to out of school children.\n\nDisclosing this at the 2021 International Literacy Day, ILD, held in Abuja on Tuesday, Adamu said the Nigerian government is determined to confront the adult literacy programmes with the same zeal it is handling out of school children.\n\nHe said developing, sustaining and enhancing literacy skills is a lifelong and community-wide endeavour, requiring a strong commitment from the society as a whole.\n\nThe Minister said Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 calls on countries to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\u2019. Specifically, SDG Target 4.6 requires that by 2030, member states should ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, it is estimated that over 6.9 million children are out of school.\n\nThis is in addition to the estimated 38% of non literate adult Population. Investing in Education of the parents will have ripple effect on the reduction of out of school Children.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that non-literate parents are more likely to breed out of school children, thereby compounding the phenomenon facing our nation today,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile flagging off the national activities to commemorate the 2021\n\nInternational Literacy Day, Adamu urged all stakeholders, including the journalists, to make a difference by complementing government\u2019s efforts in the fight against illiteracy in our various schedules, homes, families and immediate communities.\n\nAdamu commended Director General of United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation,UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay and her staff for their continued support in coordinating wide-ranging technical and financial assistance of the UN system, donor countries and the private sector, in country-level implementation of initiatives and programmes aimed at reducing the scourge of illiteracy worldwide.\n\nAlso, speaking the UNESCO Representative, Mammadou Lamine Sow said the COVID-19 pandemic has been the worst disturbance to education and training systems in a century, with the longest school closures affecting more than 1.6 billion learners at its peak time.\n\nHe quoted the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) by November 2020, which said the average child had lost 54 percent of a year\u2019s contact time, which could be interpreted as the loss of over a year\u2019s learning if the time of forgetting what was previously acquired is counted.\n\nHe said \u201cthe COVID-19 crisis has confirmed the fragility of many youth and adult literacy programmes, systems and policies as represented by the abrupt suspension of numerous programmes. Consequently, we need to reflect on what action can be taken to achieve SDG 4, target 6 by \u201censuring that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy\u201d by 2030.\u201d\n\nSow said the current shift to digital teaching and learning has further widened the inequalities to the detriment of the non-formal education sub-sector.\n\nThis shift, according to him, has also highlighted the persistent digital divide in terms of connectivity, infrastructure, and the ability to engage with technology.",

Equally, on Friday, September 10, a consignment of Colorado weighing 17.5kg and hidden inside a Grand Caravan Dodge vehicle shipped in a 40ft container from Montreal, Canada, was also intercepted and seized at the Tincan port,\u201d the statement read.\n\nMeanwhile, a 20-year-old identified as Bee Okoro has been arrested in Abuja for producing and selling drugged candies and cookies.\n\nA 27-year-old dispatch rider, Idewo Raimi who handles door-to-door delivery for her was also arrested.\n\nThe suspects who were arrested at the Garki Area 11 on Friday, September 10, with a number of their drugged products and 400grams of Loud and Arizona, confessed they have been in the business for over a year.\n\nIn Edo State, a total of 1,425.2 kilograms of compressed blocks of cannabis sativa were seized in a raid on Aviosi outskirt, close to Uzebba, Owan West LGA, on Monday, September 6, while on the same day one Yahaya Mamman was nabbed along the Zaria-Danja road, Kaduna with 10.3kg Tramadol and 60.5kg Exol-6.\n\nThe previous day, Thursday, September 5, one Thank God Danladi was arrested at Tudun Wada area of Jalingo, the Taraba State capital with 44.2kg of cannabis.\n\nIn the same vein, NDLEA operatives in Kwara State on Tuesday, September 7 arrested a 36-year-old lady, Yusuf Sherifat, who recently completed a jail sentence following her conviction by a Federal High Court in Ilorin for dealing in 22 grams of crack cocaine.\n\nHer latest arrest along Specialist Hospital Road, Alagbado, Ilorin, followed intelligence that she has resumed the sale of crack cocaine in the Ilorin metropolis.\n\n\u201cThis time around, she devised another means of delivering drugs along the road to known customers who contact her via telephone calls,\u201d the agency said.\n\nIn Gombe, raids across the state between September 1 and 10 led to the arrest of at least nine drug dealers, from who assorted illicit drugs weighing over 150kg were recovered.\n\nOne of the raids led to the interception of a truck loaded with 128KG of psychotropic substances coming from Onitsha, Anambra State along the Gombe-Yola road.\n\nReacting to the latest drug busts at the Lagos airport, Tincan seaport, and across the FCT, Edo, Kaduna, Taraba, Kwara, and Gombe states, Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), commended the commanders, officers, and men of the commands for their resilience and bravery.\n\nHe said the series of arrests and seizures across the country further affirm NDLEA\u2019s zero tolerance for production, trafficking, and abuse of any illicit substance, warning that drug dealers who are yet to have a change of heart must be ready to contend with the new NDLEA.",

          "text": "\n\nDaniil Medvedev shattered Novak Djokovic\u2019s Grand Slam dream with a straight-sets victory in the US Open final on Sunday, denying the world number one a record-breaking 21st major men\u2019s singles title.\n\nRussia\u2019s second-ranked Medvedev dominated Djokovic 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to prevent the first calendar-year Grand Slam since 1969 and keep Djokovic level with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal atop the career Slam title list.\n\n\u201cSorry for you fans and Novak because we all know what he was going for,\u201d Medvedev said.\n\n\u201cWhat you have accomplished in your career\u2026 for me, you are the greatest tennis player in history.\u201d\n\nMedvedev, the 2019 US Open runner-up, captured his first Grand Slam title in his third Slam final, a rematch of February\u2019s Australian Open final, won in straight sets by the 34-year-old Serbian to launch his Slam quest.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Daniil. Amazing match,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone that deserves a Grand Slam title right now, it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\nDjokovic\u2019s bid to sweep the US, French and Australian Opens, and Wimbledon in the same year for the first time since Rod Laver did it 52 years ago collapsed at the last hurdle, with 83-year-old Aussie legend Laver among 23,700 watching at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nREAD ALSO: 18-Year-Old Raducanu Wins Women\u2019s US Open Final\n\nDjokovic missed out on his fourth US Open title and will enter 2022 tied with \u201cBig Three\u201d rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, both absent with injuries, on an all-time record 20 men\u2019s Slam titles.\n\nA tearful Djokovic paid tribute to the crowd that roared support for him even when all seemed lost down two sets and two breaks.\n\n\u201cEven though I have not won the match, my heart is filled with joy and I\u2019m the happiest man alive because you guys have made me feel special on the court,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\n\u201cYou guys touch my soul. I\u2019ve never felt like this in New York.\u201d\n\nInstead of joining immortals Laver and Don Budge, who completed the first men\u2019s Slam in 1938, Djokovic became the third man to fall at the final match attempting to complete the Slam after Australians Jack Crawford in 1933 and Lew Hoad in 1956.\n\nDjokovic saw his 27-match Slam win streak halted three victories shy of the record he set in 2015 and 2016 when he won four consecutive Slams, ending with the 2016 French Open.\n\nMedvedev, 25, became the third Russian man to win a Grand Slam title after Yevgeny Kafelnikov at the 1996 French Open and 1999 Australian Open and Marat Safin at the 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open.\n\nStruggle from the start\n\nIn the biggest of Djokovic\u2019s 1,176 career matches, he made two unforced forehand errors to surrender a break in the first game to Medvedev, who held through to take the first set in 36 minutes, never facing a break point.\n\nIt was the fifth consecutive match in which Djokovic dropped the first set.\n\nMedvedev dropped only three points on his serve in the first set but lost that many to open his first service game in the second.\n\nDjokovic, however, squandered his break chances and Medvedev held to 1-1.\n\nMedvedev hit a backhand wide to give Djokovic a break chance in the fourth game but he netted a forehand volley.\n\nAfter botching a forehand on the following point, Djokovic shattered his racquet and on the next sent a backhand long as Medvedev held to 2-2.\n\nIn the fifth game, Djokovic mis-hit a backhand volley to hand Medvedev a break and a 3-2 lead, and the Russian held three times to claim the set.\n\nMedvedev broke to begin the third set and again in the third game when a botched volley seemed to signal the end of the Slam chase.\n\nDjokovic held at love in the fifth game but Medvedev held again to 5-1 and served for the match in the eighth game.\n\nMedvedev double-faulted on championship point and again, then netted a forehand to surrender a break that kept Djokovic in the match.\n\n\u201cIt was not easy,\u201d Medvedev said.\n\nServing again for the match at 5-4, Medvedev double-faulted on his second match point but finally got over the line on his third chance with a service winner after two hours and 16 minutes.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Emma Raducanu ended Britain\u2019s 44-year wait for a women\u2019s Grand Slam singles champion as she beat Leylah Fernandez to win the US Open in the most thrilling style.\n\nThe 18-year-old ended her scarcely believable run in New York with a 6-4 6-3 win over her 19-year-old Canadian opponent in a high-quality final.\n\nRaducanu threw herself to the floor in disbelief as she fired down an ace to conclude what has been the most remarkable journey.\n\nRaducanu served for the match at 5-3 but cut her leg as she went break point down, leading to a medical time-out and a clearly irritated Fernandez expressing her frustration to the match official.\n\nHowever, Raducanu shrugged off the delay, saving a further break point before closing out her third championship point.\n\nThe two shared a warm hug before Raducanu headed up the stairs at Arthur Ashe Stadium to celebrate with her support box.\n\nRaducanu was cheered on by an emotional Virginia Wade, who was the last British woman to win a major trophy at Wimbledon in 1977.\n\n\u201cIt means so much to have Virginia Wade here and also Tim Henman,\u201d Raducanu said in her on-court speech.\n\n\u201cThey are British icons and for me to follow in their footsteps gave me the belief I could do it.\u201d\n\nWith the victory, Raducanu becomes:\n\nThe first British female winner at Flushing Meadows since Virginia Wade in 1968\n\nThe first qualifier in the Open era to win a Slam\n\nThe youngest women\u2019s Slam champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004\n\nThe youngest Briton to win a Grand Slam title\n\nThe first woman to win the US Open without dropping a set since Serena Williams in 2014\n\nShe will take home \u00a31.8m in prize money, rise to 23 in the world rankings and will become the British number one on Monday.\n\nRaducanu will also know that she has starred in one of the biggest moments in British sporting history \u2013 and captured the imagination of the fans at home and in New York.\n\nAstonishing. Ridiculous. Meteoric. Unbelievable. Take your pick \u2013 but no word can ever really sum up what Raducanu has achieved.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Raducanu had a flight booked back to the UK, just in case she did not come through qualifying in New York. Seventeen days later, she has lifted the trophy in front of a rapturous crowd.\n\nRaducanu did not just come through qualifying: she dominated it. The most games she lost in one set in her entire run in New York \u2013 five \u2013 came in the second round of qualifying.\n\nIt is not just that Raducanu has kept on winning, but she has done it with such dominance. She did not drop a set en route to the final, despite meeting Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and in-form Maria Sakkari on the way.\n\nIn the big moments, she has held her nerve, trusting in her power and serve, even when she saw two championship points go by in the final.\n\nThis is someone who, two months ago, was collecting her A-Level results. She only made her WTA main-draw debut in June. All this has happened so quickly, and yet not once has Raducanu not looked like she belongs.\n\nWith all the attention on Raducanu after Wimbledon \u2013 as well as questions from some about her mental toughness \u2013 she could have easily been overwhelmed.\n\nInstead, she trusted in herself, hired a new coach in Andrew Richardson and went to America to play in the various events.\n\nNo-one could have seen this coming; not the ease with which Raducanu would brush her opponents aside, or the calmness with which she would approach every match.\n\nBut Raducanu always believed. And she will leave New York as the US Open champion.\n\n\u2018An almost perfect performance\u2019 \u2013 analysis\n\nFormer British number one Laura Robson on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cThere are so many sliding doors moments. Before Wimbledon, Emma didn\u2019t have a main draw wild card. Would she be in this position if they hadn\u2019t upgraded it? Would this happen if she hadn\u2019t had to retire from the fourth round with breathing problems?\n\n\u201cShe played an almost perfect performance in her first Grand Slam final. You have to think there will be so many more.\u201d\n\nFormer Wimbledon champion Pat Cash: \u201cI cannot believe it. It is unheard of for a qualifier to win the US Open. Goran Ivanisevic won Wimbledon as a wildcard but he had already been to Wimbledon finals, not playing a second Grand Slam.\n\n\u201cShe hits so cleanly. I cannot come up with a reason for this to happen. It does not make sense at all. Her performance is mindboggling.\u201d\n\nBBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: \u201cI have never seen anything like this and I suspect if I work in this business for another 20 years I won\u2019t see anything like it.\u201d\n\nA full Arthur Ashe Stadium \u2013 which holds almost 24,000 people \u2013 is one of the most intimidating sights in tennis, but neither player looked fazed as they walked out on to the biggest stage of their career.\n\nFernandez had more of the crowd support, given that she has ousted the second, third and fifth seed in New York, but there was still good support for Raducanu.\n\nThe first three games lasted for 23 minutes, both players showing a devastating array of cross-court punches and fiery returns of serve, and they traded breaks as they found their footing.\n\nAs she has done throughout the tournament, Raducanu dug herself out from 0-30 down several times, stepping forward, playing more aggressively and finding her first serves.\n\nThat gave her the confidence to attack Fernandez\u2019s second serve and put herself on top. She closed out the first set with a forehand down the line, turning and pumping her fist towards her box before letting out a yell of \u201ccome on!\u201d to the crowd as they rose to applaud.\n\nFernandez has shown tenacity throughout the tournament and she did so here, saving three break points in her first service game to stop Raducanu taking a 2-0 lead in the second.\n\nShe then found the break, adjusting to hit Raducanu\u2019s serves better, and it looked as though the momentum had swung the way of the young Canadian.\n\nHowever, there is a reason Raducanu has not dropped a set in New York. At the changeover she sat quietly, eyes closed, before again increasing her tempo and creating the break opportunity.\n\nShe broke with the shot of the match \u2013 a stunning forehand pass, made from almost off the court, that left Fernandez stranded at the net.\n\nTwo championship points came and went on the Fernandez serve, saved once again by brave hitting, but Raducanu did not falter despite taking a nasty cut to the leg as she slid behind the baseline.\n\nIt was an odd interlude in what was an entertaining final that proved that the future of women\u2019s tennis is bright.",

          "text": "Tunisia\u2019s President Kais Saied has indicated plans to change the country\u2019s constitution, seven weeks after he seized power in moves his opponents called a coup.\n\nThe comments on Saturday represented Saied\u2019s clearest statement yet about what he intends to do next, having sworn there was \u201cno going back\u201d to the situation in the North African nation before his intervention on July 25.\n\nSpeaking live on television in a central Tunis boulevard, Saied said he respected the 2014 democratic constitution but that it was \u201cnot eternal\u201d and could be amended.\n\n\u201cAmendments must be made within the framework of the constitution,\u201d he told the Sky News Arabia channel and Tunisian state television.\n\nOne of Saied\u2019s advisers told Reuters news agency on Thursday the president was planning to suspend the constitution and offer an amended version via a referendum, prompting opposition from political parties and the powerful UGTT labour union.\n\nAnxiety has been growing, both internally and among Western democracies that have supported Tunisia\u2019s public finances, over Saied\u2019s intentions since his July 25 announcement that he was sacking the prime minister and suspending parliament.\n\nThe former constitutional law professor justified those moves by citing emergency measures in the constitution that his critics and many legal scholars said did not support his intervention. Though he indefinitely extended the measures after a month, he has yet to appoint a new government or make any clear declaration of his long-term intentions, as Tunisia struggles to confront a rolling economic crisis.\n\nSaied on Saturday pledged again to form a new government \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after selecting \u201cthe people with the most integrity\u201d.\n\nHe declined to give a specific timeline, however.\n\nSaied\u2019s intervention drew widespread support after years of political paralysis, but it has thrust Tunisia into crisis a decade after it threw off dictatorship and embraced democracy in the revolution that triggered the Arab Spring.\n\nPolitical leaders have complained about the constitution since it was agreed in 2014, calling for it to be changed to either a more directly presidential, or a more directly parliamentary, system.\n\nArticle 144 of the constitution says an amendment to the document can only be put to a referendum if it has already been approved by two-thirds of the parliament, an institution Saied last month called \u201ca danger to the state\u201d.\n\nThe current parliament was elected in 2019, a week after Saied was elected. He does not have the power to dissolve it and call new elections, but some of the parties in the deeply fragmented chamber have indicated they could do so themselves.\n\nThe moderate Islamist Ennahdha, the biggest party in parliament with a quarter of the seats, has accused Saied of carrying out a coup and on Saturday said deviating from the constitution would mean a retreat from democracy.\n\nThe UGTT, the main labour union in Tunisia, also signalled on Saturday it opposed the idea of suspending the constitution and called instead for new parliamentary elections.\n\nMeanwhile ambassadors from the Group of Seven advanced economies last week urged the Tunisian president to quickly form a government and return to \u201ca constitutional order, in which an elected parliament plays a significant role\u201d.",

Inoculations for elderly patients, which started in April, were also slowed by supply shortages of imported vaccines, but the pace picked up in late May and has since achieved 1 million doses per day.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of COVID-19 measures, told NHK public television\u2019s weekly talk show Sunday that about 60% of the population is expected to be fully vaccinated by the end of September, on par with current levels in Europe.\n\nThe government is studying a roadmap for easing restrictions around November when a large majority of the population is expected to be fully vaccinated. That would allow fully vaccinated people and those who test negative to travel, gather for parties or attend mass events.\n\nThe progress of vaccinations has helped reduce serious cases and deaths among older people, but infections from virus variants spread explosively in August among younger generations still largely unvaccinated, severely straining health care systems.\n\nJapan last Friday extended the ongoing state of emergency in Tokyo and 18 other areas until Sept. 30.

          "text": "The FBI late Saturday released a newly declassified document related to logistical support given to two of the Saudi hijackers in the run-up to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The document details contacts the hijackers had with Saudi associates in the U.S. but does not provide proof that senior Saudi government officials were complicit in the plot.\n\nReleased on the 20th anniversary of the attacks, the document is the first investigative record to be disclosed since President Joe Biden ordered a declassification review of materials that for years have remained out of public view. The 16-page document is a summary of an FBI interview done in 2015 with a man who had frequent contact with Saudi nationals in the U.S. who supported the first hijackers to arrive in the country before the attacks.\n\nBiden last week ordered the Justice Department and other agencies to conduct a declassification review and release what documents they can over the next six months. He had encountered pressure from victims\u2019 families, who have long sought the records as they pursue a lawsuit in New York alleging that Saudi government officials supported the hijackers.\n\nThe heavily redacted document was disclosed on Saturday night, hours after Biden attended Sept. 11 memorial events in New York, Pennsylvania and northern Virginia. Victims\u2019 relatives had earlier objected to Biden\u2019s presence at ceremonial events as long as the documents remained classified.\n\nThe Saudi government has long denied any involvement in the attacks. The Saudi Embassy in Washington has it supported the full declassification of all records as a way to \u201cend the baseless allegations against the Kingdom once and for all.\u201d The embassy said that any allegation that Saudi Arabia was complicit was \u201ccategorically false.\u201d\n\nThe trove of documents are being released at a politically delicate time for the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, two nations that have forged a strategic \u2014 if difficult \u2014 alliance, particularly on counterterrorism matters. The Biden administration in February released an intelligence assessment implicating Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the 2018 killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but drew criticism from Democrats for avoiding a direct punishment of the crown prince himself.\n\nVictims\u2019 relatives cheered the document\u2019s release as a significant step in their effort to connect the attacks to Saudi Arabia. Brett Eagleson, whose father, Bruce, was killed in the World Trade Center attack, said the release of the FBI material \u201caccelerates our pursuit of truth and justice.\u201d\n\nJim Kreindler, a lawyer for the victims\u2019 relatives, said in a statement that \u201cthe findings and conclusions in this FBI investigation validate the arguments we have made in the litigation regarding the Saudi government\u2019s responsibility for the 9/11 attacks.\n\n\u201cThis document, together with the public evidence gathered to date, provides a blueprint for how (al-Qaida) operated inside the US with the active, knowing support of the Saudi government,\u201d he said.\n\nThat includes, he added, Saudi officials exchanging phone calls among themselves and al-Qaida operatives and then having \u201caccidental meetings\u201d with the hijackers while providing them with assistance to get settled and find flight schools.\n\nRegarding Sept. 11, there has been speculation of official involvement since shortly after the attacks, when it was revealed that 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudis. Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida at the time, was from a prominent family in the kingdom.\n\nThe U.S. investigated some Saudi diplomats and others with Saudi government ties who knew hijackers after they arrived in the U.S., according to documents that have already been declassified.\n\nStill, the 9/11 Commission report in 2004 found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d the attacks that al-Qaida masterminded, though it noted Saudi-linked charities could have diverted money to the group.\n\nParticular scrutiny has centered on the first two hijackers to arrive in the U.S., Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar and support they received.\n\nIn February 2000, shortly after their arrival in southern California, they encountered at a halal restaurant a Saudi national named Omar al-Bayoumi who helped them find and lease an apartment in San Diego, had ties to the Saudi government and had earlier attracted FBI scrutiny.\n\nBayoumi has described his restaurant meeting with Hazmi and Mihdhar as a \u201cchance encounter,\u201d and the FBI during its interview made multiple attempts to ascertain if that characterization was accurate or if it had actually been arranged in advance, according to the document.\n\nThe 2015 interview that forms the basis of the document was of a man who was applying for U.S. citizenship and who years earlier had repeated contacts with Saudi nationals who investigators said provided \u201csignificant logistical support\u201d to several of the hijackers. Among his contacts was Bayoumi, according to the document.\n\nThe man\u2019s identity is redacted throughout the document, but he is described as having worked at the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso referenced in the document is Fahad al-Thumairy, at the time an accredited diplomat at the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles who investigators say led an extremist faction at his mosque. The document says communications analysis identified a seven-minute phone call in 1999 from Thumairy\u2019s phone to the Saudi Arabian family home phone of two brothers who became future detainees at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison.\n\nBoth Bayoumi and Thumairy left the U.S. weeks before the attacks.",
          "summary": "The FBI late Saturday released a newly declassified document related to logistical support given to two of the Saudi hijackers in the run-up to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nThe document details contacts the hijackers had with Saudi associates in the U.S. but does not provide proof that senior Saudi government officials were complicit in the plot.\nThe heavily redacted document was disclosed on Saturday night, hours after Biden attended Sept. 11 memorial events in New York, Pennsylvania and northern Virginia.\nVictims\u2019 relatives cheered the document\u2019s release as a significant step in their effort to connect the attacks to Saudi Arabia.\nRegarding Sept. 11, there has been speculation of official involvement since shortly after the attacks, when it was revealed that 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudis.",
