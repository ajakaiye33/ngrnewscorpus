          "text": "The Country Director of ActionAid Nigeria, Ene Obi, has urged the Federal Government to immediately unban Twitter, a microblogging social media platform, and rather ban insecurity and other socio-economic challenges confronting the country.\n\nShe made the plea on Tuesday in Abuja at the Youth Digital Engagement Project closeout and dissemination meeting.\n\nAccording to her, the recent ban of Twitter by the government of Nigeria is not only a step backwards for the YDE project campaign, but also threatens the civic space in Nigeria which has continued to shrink in recent years.\n\nShe called on the government to rescind its decision as this has a huge impact on the lives of emerging young entrepreneurs who depend on social media for their livelihood.\n\n\u201cIt is also a counter-productive move for a nation seeking to create more jobs and reduce poverty as part of its post-COVID-19 recovery strategy,\u201d Obi said.\n\nShe said that the YDE sought to use technology to support the work of young people in holding duty bearers to account through funding from the Danish International Development Agency.\n\nShe said that in Nigeria, the innovation was pioneered in partnership with Gombe State Youth Parliament, Gombe State; the African Human Development Centre, Akwa Ibom State and the Centre for Information Technology and Development in the FCT.\n\nObi said that young people were supported and empowered to access information, analyse data, present evidence, and lead their communities in taking action through the use of digital engagement tools through the project.\n\nObi, however, noted that data shows that awareness is low and the proportion of persons that have benefitted from the programmes is even lower, compared to expectations and experiences of Brazil and other countries with a similar policy.\n\nAlso, a representative of the Centre for Information Technology and Development in FCT, Josephine Adokwu, said that the strategic location of the FCT in the north-central region of the country and the dominance of farming activities exposes its inhabitants to variants of shocks.\n\nOn his part, the Gombe State Youth Parliament/JONAPwD, Gombe State represented by Khalid Ahmed, said that findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed young persons and their families to hunger, poverty, insecurity and worsened access to health services in the state.\n\n\u201cMost respondents, being farmers, were further exposed to the challenges of climate change as storage of farm harvest could not last due to market closures and poor patronage. The findings from Gombe State data shows that three out of 10 persons with disabilities surveyed expressed that their welfare was severely affected by the COVID \u2013 19 pandemic among others\u201d, he said.",

This is completely unacceptable as it is worsening the already biting economic hardship and frightening unemployment level in the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the ban on Twitter in Nigeria appears to be in favour of criminal and terrorist elements, whose activities fester in an environment of suppressed information flow.\u201d\n\nThe caucus sympathised with the organised private sector, manufacturing and service providing companies; Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises; online businesses owners and other hard working entrepreneurs across the country, \u201cwhose genuine business and means of livelihood have been crippled by the unwarranted ban on Twitter by the APC Federal Government.\u201d\n\nThe minority lawmakers also identified with students, research-based organisations, media houses, the organised civil society, faith-based organisations and community groups, among others, whose information-based activities have been violently disrupted by the ban.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the joint caucus sympathises with regional, states, local government as well as members of the international community, whose genuine and constructive activities have been crippled by the prohibition of twitter in Nigeria\n\n\u201cIt also identifies with traditional rulers, who have even found Twitter as a means of communicating with the constituents, especially in this era of insecurity in the country,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe Joint Caucus vehemently berates the APC-led government for abandoning its duty of addressing the serious economic and security problems confronting our nation to rather focus on dissipating energy victimizing Nigerians over their disagreement with Twitter for deleting a post by an individual.\n\nThe Caucus counsels the Federal Government to swallow its pride, accept its misdoing and go and settle whatever issue it has with Twitter instead of this resort to inflicting pains on Nigerians.",

These acts of violence are not supported and cannot be supported by the people of the South-East.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSOReps condemn continuous casualisation of workers\n\nThe Concerned Southeast SANs commiserate with the families of law enforcement officers, other public servants and private individuals who have lost their loved ones as a result of the recent carnage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThey continued: \u2018\u2019Southeasterners are peace-loving, law abiding and development-oriented people and the recent carnage is not representative of the aspirations of the good people of the Southeast, just as is the case with the other geo-political zones of the Country where there have been security challenges.\n\nIt is indeed worrisome that the persons or group of people responsible for the mayhem; where they are from and what their objectives are remain unknown. It is equally worrisome that the management of the crisis unfortunately exhibits double standards with regard to the response of Federal security agencies in South-East vis \u00e0-vis other similarly afflicted zones.\n\nIn order to find an immediate resolution and stop further degeneration of the security situation, the Concerned Southeast SANs hereby call for a truce and immediate cessation of hostilities on all sides to allow for a consideration of the underlying issues and grievances which have led to the recent rise in ethnic or tribal nationalism not only in the South-East but in other parts of the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nThey called on those who are destroying public and private properties, especially facilities of law enforcement agencies in the South-East zone to immediately discontinue their actions in order to forestall the slide into a total breakdown of law and order in the zone.\n\nThey also appealled to the Federal Government to embrace dialogue and diplomacy as a means of resolving the myriad of growing disaffections across the entire country in the interest of peace and unity of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe senior lawyers also appealled to all Nigerians especially those in leadership positions to desist from rhetoric capable of inflaming the situation rather than bringing the desired peace and unity which we earnestly desire.\n\n\u2018\u2019In this regard, the Concerned Southeast SANs respectfully request His Excellency General Abdulsalam Abubakar GCFR, His Excellency Dr. Ebele Goodluck Jonathan GCFR, His Excellency Chief Emeka Anyaoku CFR, Pastor Tunde Bakare, Colonel Dangiwa Umar (Rtd) jointly with other well-meaning Nigerians from the six geo political zones to intervene quickly in the matter with a view to securing a truce which would provide a conducive atmosphere for resolving the underlying issues which are currently threatening the survival of our dear nation.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "Justice Muhammad\n\nSome Abuja-based lawyers on Wednesday expressed divergent views on the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Muhammad\u2019s proposal to review salaries of Judicial Officers, every four years.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that by the dictate of Section 84 (1), the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) reviewed judges\u2019 salary by the enactment of, \u2019\u2019Certain Political, Public and Judicial Office Holders (Salaries and Allowances, etc.) (Amendment) Act, 2008\u2019\u2019 which came into force on Feb. 1, 2007.\n\nNAN reports that since the has not been reviewed with effect from 2008, judges\u2019 salaries have remained the same for about 13 years.\n\nMuhammad on June 3, asked the National Assembly to alter the 1999 constitution to mandate the National Judicial Council (NJC) to fix and review judges salaries every four years.\n\nThe CJN made this submission in the paper he presented as submissions by the judiciary on the occasion of the national public hearing by Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution held at the Africa Hall of the International Conference Centre in Abuja.\n\nA legal practitioner, Dare Owolabi said: \u201cthe CJN\u2019s application for amendment of the constitution in respect of the adjustment of judges\u2019 salaries every four years is long overdue.\u201d\n\nIt is another wing of the clamour for judicial independence, political office holders use money not power to remove the blindfold of lady justice and this is made possible by the poor conditions of service of the judges.\n\n\u201cI support anything that will usher in sanity in our judiciary and financial independence plays a major role,\u201d Owolabi said.\n\nHe however said other proposed amendments regarding reduction of the Supreme Court bench to 16 from 21 and seeking the leave of the Court for appeals from the Court of Appeal is diversionary and inhibit smooth administration of justice.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court is attending to 2015 appeals in 2021, there are over 6,000 appeals in the Lagos division of the Court of Appeal alone and only 350 are assigned to panels, we were already taking 2023 dates for Court of Appeal matters in Abuja and so on.\u201d\n\n\u201cReducing the bench or asking for leave before appeal at the Supreme Court is putting the cart before the horse.\n\nALSO READ: Keep using Twitter, N/Assembly Joint Minority Caucus tells Nigerians\n\n\u201cThe bench should be widened, all bureaucratic procedures should be jettisoned and it should be introduced at all levels for speedy administration of justice,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Mr Sunday Amos, another lawyer, said the CJN\u2019s prayers were great.\n\n\u201d I personally buy into everything His Lordship put on the table here except the reduction of the number of Justices of the Supreme Court from 21 to 16.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, l think the number should be increased taking into account the fact that a full panel of the Apex Court consists of seven Lord Justices.\n\n\u201d On a general note, the amendments proffered by His Lordship will ensure that the Judiciary is truly independent in all respect. It\u2019s indeed a commendable effort\u201d Amos said.\n\nAlso, Okey Nnaji, another Lawyer said the proposal was what is obtainable in a normal democratic setting.\n\n\u201d Ideally, the Judiciary is an independent arm and should be able to carry out it\u2019s own function and administration without interference of the executive, yet, subject to the principle of checks and balances.\n\n\u201d The proposal is to empower the Judiciary to function well to curb unfortunate incidents of allegation of bribery and also to be at par with their counterparts in other climes.\n\n\u201d Moreso, increase in the number of Judges at the Appeal level is not negotiable because the dockets of the Court of Appeal is well overloaded that appeals sometimes might not be dispensed with in good time , average of three to seven years to finish an appeal from a trial court)\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Apex court is laden with a lot of frivolous appeals which ordinarily should not be there.\n\nNnaji said that because the law states that matters can be appealed as of right and that places of lot of burden on the Supreme Court to listen to these appeals despite it\u2019s obvious frivolities.\n\n\u201cIf approved, matters will need permission before it\u2019ll be taken at that level at least to find out if it is meritorious.\n\n\u201cThe recent saga involving the former CJN and the Code of conduct leaves a sour taste and display of manipulation where there\u2019s lacuna in the laws.\n\n\u201cThis will be cured if the jurisdiction of that court is properly placed especially with the nomination of its head\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr Awaliene Shaka, said that the problem of the judiciary was not the increase of salaries of judges or the reduction of the numbers of it\u2019s judges at the supreme court.\n\n\u201d In other words, the NJC should be strengthened in it\u2019s selection of judges process than any other issue, a quality judge guarantees quality judicial system.\n\n\u201d A candidate for appointment to the bench or elevation to the court of appeal; Supreme court should in the course of his career as a legal practitioner exhibit the some aspects of judicial temperament/\n\n\u201dThese are intelligence, ethics, courage and integrity, education and experience, suitability to work load, patience, open-mindedness, courtesy, punctuality, firmness, understanding, compassion, humility, health, character and common sense\u201d he said.\n\nShaka said that these qualities should be demonstrated consistently and verified from written and oral submissions made by a candidate in the course of his practice.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "THE Senate has begun the screening and subsequent confirmation of the Special Assistant, Social Media to President Muhammadu Buhari, Lauretta Onochie as a National Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan on Wednesday forwarded the name of Onochie and five others as Federal Commissioners to the Senator Kabiru Gaya, All Progressives Congress, APC, Kano South led Senate Committee on INEC.\n\nLawan gave the Committee two weeks to carry out legislative action on the list and report back at Plenary.\n\nThe action of the President of the Senate was sequel to the Executive Communication read by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, APC, Kebbi North that the Senate do consider the request of President Muhammadu Buhari on the confirmation of the Nominations of the following persons for Appointment as Commissioners of INEC in accordance with Paragraph 14 Part 1(F) of the Third Schedule to the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as Amended.\n\nAside Onochie, other names that were referred to the Senate Committee are Prof. Muhammad Sani Kallah from Katsina; Prof. Kunle Cornelius Ajayi, Ekiti State; Saidu Babura Ahmad, Jigawa; Prof. Sani Muhammad Adam, North Central and Dr. Baba Bila, North East.\n\nRecall that President Muhammadu Buhari had in October , 2020, forwarded to the Senate for Screening and subsequent confirmation, his Special Assistant, Social Media, Lauretta Onochie as a National Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\nPresident of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan read the letter from President Buhari forwarding the name of Onochie from Delta along side three other National Commissioners.\n\nOthers are Prof. Mohammed Sani from Katsina State; Prof. Kunle Ajayi from Ekiti State and Seidu Ahmed from Jigawa.\n\nBuhari had said \u201cAppointment for Commissioners for INEC. Pursuant to paragraph 14 of part 11 of the first schedule of the 1999 constitution.\u201d\n\nAlso recall that same month last year, fourteen leading Civil Society Organisations, CSOs took a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari following his nomination of his Special Assistant, Social Media, Lauretta Onochie as a National Commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC for Screening and subsequent confirmation.\n\nAlso same day, Senator Dino Melaye who represented Kogi West in the Senate 8th Senate and early part of the present 9th Senate, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately rescind the nomination of Ms. Lauretta Onochie, as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nMelaye described the nomination as unconstitutional, affront on the patience of Nigerians and an insult to the institution of INEC.\n\nIn a statement then, the 14 CSOs while reacting to the development, said that the nomination did not go well with the recent gains of the electoral system in the country.\n\nThe Leaders of the civil societies who signed the statement were the executive director of Peering Advocacy and Advancement Center, Convener of Say No Campaign, Comrade Ezenwa Nwagwu, executive director Center for Democracy, Idayat Hassan, executive director Center for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) Faith Nwadishi among others.\n\nThe statement titled, \u201d Nomination of Lauretta Onochie as National Commissioner INEC\u201d, read \u201cWhereas it has come to our notice the nomination of Lauretta Onochie by President Muhammadu Buhari as a National Commissioner of INEC, via a letter sent to the senate leadership for screening and confirmation on 13th October 2020, we completely reject this nomination, which does not sit well in the recent gains of the electoral system in the country.\n\n\u201cWhereas the 1999 Nigeria constitution (As amended) in the 3rd schedule, part 2f, paragraph 14(b) provides that National Electoral Commissioners of INEC, shall be non-partisan and persons of unquestionable integrity, who shall be nominated by the President.\n\n\u201cWhereas, the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC, is an independent body overseeing the electoral processes in the country without any affiliation to any of the political parties should not have any of its governing bodies member identified as a person sympathetic to any political party.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore troubled that Lauretta Onochie, a serving aide of the President who openly supports the president and his political party, has been nominated to the position of National Commissioner, INEC. Any INEC National commissioner should enjoy the trust and confidence of all parties concerned (Ruling and Opposition), Ms. Onochie failed this critical test with her several open confrontations with opposition elements through the media.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United States Government has called for the immediate reversal of the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe call by the US is the fourth intervention the country has made in a week after last Friday\u2019s suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria by the federal government.\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power said the suspension was nothing more than state-sanctioned denial of free speech.\n\nPower noted that Nigeria has nearly 40 million Twitter users, while also saying that the country was home to Africa\u2019s largest tech hub.\n\nIn a Facebook post by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, Power said the suspension should be reversed immediately.\n\n\u2018There are nearly 40 M Twitter users in #Nigeria, and the country is home to Africa\u2019s largest tech hub. This suspension is nothing more than state-sanctioned denial of free speech and should be reversed immediately,\u2019 Power said.\n\nThe United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria had last Saturday issued a statement where it said the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations was an infringement on the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\n\u2018Nigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses. Banning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater. The path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity,\u2019 the United States said.\n\nClosely followed by the statement was a joint release by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, the United Kingdom, the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Canadian High Commission and the Embassy of Ireland.\n\nIn the joint statement, the five missions expressed disappointment over the Federal Government\u2019s decision to place a ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The diplomatic missions of Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America convey our disappointment over the Government of Nigeria\u2019s announcement suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media,\u2019 the statement partly read.\n\nThe US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, had while responding to a question concerning the joint statement on Monday during a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, said the missions maintained their position.\n\n\u2018We remain firm in our position that free access to the ability to express one\u2019s self is actually very important, and perhaps even more important in troubled times,\u2019 Leonard said.",

But nothing is too difficult for God to do. That is why we are here,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cWe have some challenges. These are beyond what we can handle.

They complain about government and politicians but they do not take their role of citizen participation seriously. The leaders are happy about this and take full advantage of the docile nature of most Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, it is only when Nigerians actively use their right of citizen participation in governance that the leaders will be on their toes and live up to their responsibilities.\n\nThe cleric reminded leaders that once they took their oath of office with either Bible or Quran, they had put themselves under the judgment of God.\n\nAnother panelist, Mr Bola Abimbola, Executive Director of Savannah Centre, noted that some of the problems in the country stemmed from a trust-deficit between government and citizens.\n\nAbimbola, represented by Mr Felix Pwol, a Director at the centre, said it was imperative for government to focus on achieving national unity, national security, women and youth development as well as civil society and government partnership.\n\nExecutive Director of Lux Terra, Rev.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, yesterday, at Igangan, vowed to do everything possible to ensure massacre by criminal herdsmen never happen again.\n\nAddressing members of the community, he said: \u201cI promise you this is the last time anything like this will ever happen here. It is a promise I am making to you and it is a promise I will come through with.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take law into your hands. I appeal to all those that lost loved ones because sometimes, the emotion can be really high, give us the opportunity to resolve this and make this place safer for you. You can see the light-up project that we are carrying out, it is for us to be able to see everywhere, whether it is day or night. There are people that do not want progress for our community, for our state and for our country. But I have faith that God will have mercy on us, our state and our country.\n\n\u201cSo, I appeal to you, give us the opportunity to come back, rebuild things and put in a more solid architecture, such that you will be able to go to your farms and do your business without fear of anything.\n\n\u201cBut I should be held accountable. I am responsible for this and I will do everything within my power to ensure it would not happen again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Makinde called on the Federal Government to permit governors in the South West to equip Amotekun Corps with sophisticated weapons, such as AK-47, to tackle rising insecurity, especially banditry and kidnapping in the geo-political zone.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the massacre of more than 10 persons in Igangan, Ibarapa zone of Oyo State on Saturday night by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, who residents of Ibarapa claimed had threatened many weeks ago that they would strike, and eventually struck.\n\nMakinde made the call in a keynote address during the opening of a two-day 2021 Governor Seyi Makinde National Democracy Summit, with the theme: \u2018The Future of Democracy in Nigeria\u2019, at the International Conference Centre, University of Ibadan.\n\nMakinde, who left the summit midway for Igangan, expressed frustration on the challenges being faced by governors that are called chief security officers but cannot ask federal security agencies in their respective states to attend to security situation without them getting clearance from Abuja.\n\nThe governor said the only way out is for the Federal Government to allow state police for states to take charge of peculiar security challenges confronting them individually, adding that the state should be given power at the same time to control the natural resources in their states.\n\n\u201cWith what happened at Igangan, the people can hold me responsible for letting them down and when I go there, I will take responsibility because those killings were really needless. Even though I continue to take responsibility for the security situation in Oyo State, we all know that, in reality, the commissioner of police has to wait for orders from \u2018above\u2019 before taking specific actions to benefit the local population.\n\n\u201cSo, looking at the federal security agencies here in Oyo State, they have to get clearance from the federal. We will continue to do our best. Here in the South West, we were able to kickstart Amotekun. But even with Amotekun, people ask how the killings happened. Were they not there? But we have several limitations to what Amotekun can do and even the firearms they can carry.\n\n\u201cYou have dane guns and you are faced with people carrying AK-47. If it is in terms of investment, if we are given the authority, I will also buy AK-47 for Amotekun, if given the licence,\u201d he said.\n\nMakinde said the people should appreciate that \u201cstate policing is a sure cure to our national development challenges. Anyone who has been involved in security at any level will tell you that policing is local. One of the reasons the Western Nigeria Security Network, code-named Amotekun, is recording success is because members of the corps are drawn from the locality. They know the terrain and so can gather needed intelligence. Also, they can be held accountable by the local people because they know them.\n\n\u201cSo, when state governors become the actual chief security officers in charge of the security personnel in their states, they can quickly respond to security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe are the Federal Republic of Nigeria. But our federalism exists in name only. Students of political history will tell you that what we have been practising is, in fact, a unitary system of government \u2013 where more powers are concentrated in the central government. Another thing that our political theorists will tell you is that by nature, a unitary system of government is better suited for small countries.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not a small country. So, you can easily identify why we are experiencing developmental challenges across the board. We are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. For true federalism to thrive, the federating units should have more powers and autonomy. The government at the centre serves as a coordinator of assets but does not wield as much power,\u201d Makinde said..",

Anyone that has lost a close relative knows what it means to lose parents or children. I am more concerned about the lives lost because of the trickle down effects on families.\n\n\u201cOur people are not known for burning homes to punish enemies. Destroying police stations and infrastructures can never be the best path to express grievances.

We should come to understand that every war ends on a table. Instead of destructions before coming to the table, is it not wiser to come to table and avoid destruction?

Our people have raised the alarm and we are very worried at the rate of disappearance and deaths of innocent young men. Some of our young people now live indoors for the fear of being tagged unknown gunman,\u201d Kalu said.\n\nHe also reaffirmed his call for a national dialogue chaired by the president and said the need for a national dialogue was to douse tension in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way, our entanglement is so deep that all we need is diligent and deliberate efforts to realise the great dividends of diversity and pluralism.\n\n\u201cOur unity is our strength and can forever live in unity notwithstanding the diversity in culture, religion and tongues. A dialogue that has all stakeholders on the table and with the president as chairman, will go a long way in dousing tension across the regions,\u201d Kalu said.",

          "title": "W\u2019Bank Raises GDP Growth Forecast for Nigeria to 1.8%",
          "text": "By Obinna Chima in Lagos and Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank has increased Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projection for 2021 to 1.8 per cent, higher than the 1.1 per cent it had estimated for the country earlier this year.\n\nThe Washington-based institution, in its June 2021 Global Economic Prospect released yesterday, also forecast the GDP growth to hit 2.1 per cent for the country in 2022, compared with the 1.8 per cent it had predicted for Nigeria in the earlier report released in January.\n\nNigeria recorded a GDP growth rate of 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020, according to figures the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released last month.\n\nBut the World Bank hinged its positive prediction for Nigeria on the expectation that crude oil prices would remain high as well as the government effecting structural reforms and flexible exchange rate management.\n\nIt said: \u201cGrowth in Nigeria is expected to resume at 1.8 per cent in 2021 and edge up to 2.1 per cent next year, assuming higher oil prices, structural oil sector reforms, and market-based flexible exchange rate management.\u201d\n\nThe report stated that output in Sub-Saharan Africa shrank at an estimated 2.4 per cent in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a milder-than-expected recession.\n\nIt added that growth in the region has gradually resumed this year, which it stated was a reflection of positive spillovers from strengthening global economic activity, including higher oil and metal prices, and some progress in containing COVID-19, especially in Western and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has contributed to wider budget deficits and a spike in government debt, heightening the risk of debt distress in some countries. Activity in the three largest economies\u2014Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa\u2014 has partially recovered.\n\n\u201cMany industrial and agricultural commodity exporting countries experienced deep contractions last year. In tourism reliant countries, international arrivals have been at a near-halt, and tourism is likely to remain slow until wider vaccination permits safe reopening to international travel.\n\n\u201cDespite improvement, COVID-19 has continued to have adverse impacts on health, schooling, investment, and economic growth,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the report, in some countries such as Angola and Nigeria, accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, currency depreciations, and rising food and energy prices \u201chave stoked inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cElsewhere (Kenya, South Africa), subdued demand has kept inflation in check,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the report, foreign direct investments in the region have been resilient, recouping about nine-tenths of their pre-pandemic levels, and workers\u2019 remittances to the region have held up better than expected.\n\n\u201cGrowth is forecast to resume to 2.8 per cent this year and firm to 3.3 per cent in 2022, underpinned by stronger external demand, mainly from China and the United States, higher commodity prices, and containment of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cProcurement and logistical challenges are expected to continue hobble the pace of vaccination despite the provision of vaccines by COVAX. Policy uncertainty and the lingering effects of the pandemic are expected to delay major investments in infrastructure and extractives and to weigh on the recovery (Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Niger, Kenya).\n\n\u201cPer capita income levels in 2022 are expected to be four per cent lower on average than in 2019. Conditions in the region\u2019s fragile and conflict-affected countries are expected to be particularly challenging; their average output level in 2022 is forecast to be 5.3 per cent below its size in 2019,\u201d it said.\n\nIt stated that while some countries (Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa) are presently upgrading national vaccine distribution systems, procurement and logistical hurdles in many other countries could slow vaccinations.\n\nIt, however, warned that an oil price drop could dent revenues for some oil exporters.\n\n\u201cFood insecurity remains a key risk as food prices have risen by more than 20 percent early this year in Angola, Ethiopia and Nigeria. Flood and drought could also destroy crops, exacerbate food price inflation, and further weigh on household consumption.\n\n\u201cRising conflicts could weaken recoveries. A sudden rise in sovereign borrowing costs could instigate financial pressures in some countries and high debt burdens and fiscal pressures could become more acute.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the pace of vaccinations could surpass expectations, restoring consumer and business confidence and strengthening the recovery. A stronger-than-expected rally in metal and oil prices could boost revenues,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe global economy was expected to expand by 5.6 per cent in 2021, the fastest post-recession pace in 80 years, largely on strong rebounds from a few major economies.\n\nThe projected expansion would make 2021 the fastest year of growth since 1973\u2019s 6.6 per cent.\n\nHowever, many emerging market and developing economies continue to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, the World Bank said.\n\nAccording to the 189-country anti-poverty agency, the world economy, which shrank 3.5 per cent last year as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade, forced businesses to close and people to stay at home, will grow 5.6 per cent this year, up from the 4.1 per cent it forecast in January.\n\nBut the World Bank noted that despite the recovery, global output will be about 2 per cent below pre-pandemic projections by the end of this year.\n\nPer capita income losses will also not be unwound by 2022 for about two-thirds of emerging market and developing economies.\n\nAmong low-income economies, where vaccination has lagged, the effects of the pandemic have reversed poverty reduction gains and aggravated insecurity and other long-standing challenges.\n\nCommenting on the report, World Bank Group President, Mr. David Malpass, said: \u201cWhile there are welcome signs of global recovery, the pandemic continues to inflict poverty and inequality on people in developing countries around the world.\n\n\u201cGlobally coordinated efforts are essential to accelerate vaccine distribution and debt relief, particularly for low-income countries. As the health crisis eases, policymakers will need to address the pandemic\u2019s lasting effects and take steps to spur green, resilient, and inclusive growth while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NBC to license OTT\n\n\u2022House probes legality of stoppage, summons information minister\n\n\u2022Despite ordering violators\u2019 prosecution, Malami accesses Twitter, deactivates account\n\n\u2022Trump lauds Nigeria over Twitter\u2019s suspension\n\nEzeobi Chiemelie in Lagos, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe suspension of the operation of American microblogging company, Twitter, in Nigeria by the federal government is to remain indefinitely until the company shows remorse, a top federal government official told THISDAY yesterday.\n\nAccording to him, since the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria last Friday, the company has not reached out to the federal government for dialogue.\n\nHowever, the House of Representatives has waded into the dispute as it mandated its Committees on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence to investigate the circumstances leading to the suspension of operations of Twitter in Nigeria and the legality of the action.\n\nIt also summoned the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to shed light on the matter.\n\nBut despite the suspension and the order by the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), to prosecute violators of the suspension directive, many prominent Nigerians and some organisations have remained active on the microblogging site.\n\nNotwithstanding his order, Malami yesterday logged on to Twitter, using Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass the blockade by telecoms companies that have blocked access to the site, to deactivate his account.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that contrary to the impression given to the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth-Leonard, that Twitter was already holding talks with the federal government, the source said no discussion was going on.\n\nBeth-Leonard had led heads of the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland missions to a meeting with the Minister Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, on Monday in Abuja, where she said she was glad to learn that Twitter was negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the source said: \u201cAs we speak, there has been no communication between Twitter and the federal government, and until the company does the needful, its operations will remain suspended indefinitely.\u201d\n\nThe source said the federal government suspended Twitter because it had persistently made its platform available for the propagation of activities of persons who want to destabilise the country.\n\nHe said when the federal government complained, Twitter said the propagandists had not violated its rules.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the federal government approached Twitter to remove a tweet by Nnamdi Kanu but the company responded that the material did not offend its rules,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that even after that, Kanu used Twitter to ask his followers to kill Nigerian soldiers and police personnel and they obeyed.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf that is not offensive, what is?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, over the top (OTT) companies operate in Nigeria without registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and paying tax on the billions they make in the country.\n\nThis, he said, would no longer happen as henceforth, the OTTs would now have to register as Nigerian companies and would be expected to comply with the terms of their registration with the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).\n\n\u201cAnyone of them that is not registered would not be allowed to operate. Anyone that abuses the terms of its registration would have its licence withdrawn,\u201d he added.\n\nHouse Investigates Legality of Suspension, Summons Information Minister\n\nThe House of Representatives has mandated its various committees to probe the circumstances of the decision by the federal government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria and the legality of the suspension.\n\nThe House also summoned the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to appear before it and explain the reasons for the action.\n\nThe directives were contained in an address delivered by the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, at the resumption of plenary yesterday.\n\nGbajabiamila said the lawmakers were aware that the suspension of Twitter had generated a fierce debate, adding that the House has since the announcement been inundated with comments about the decision, requests for intervention and criticism.\n\nHe stated that the House recognised that Twitter, like other social media networks, is an important tool for communication and commerce in Nigeria, particularly among the younger generation who have used these networks for enterprise and innovation.\n\nHe, however, said the House also recognised that as social media has been a tool for good, it could also be a tool for bad actors, hence the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that these platforms are not used to commit vile actions against individuals and the state.\n\nAccording to him, it\u2019s the proper role of the legislature in circumstances like this to unravel the issues until they develop an understanding of the why and the how of executive decisions.\n\nGbajabiamila added that the legislature must ensure that regulatory and enforcement actions by the government are in accordance with the laws, due process followed and the outcomes of regulatory decisions do not result in adverse consequences for the country and its people.\n\nHe gave the committees 10 days to conclude the assignment and report back to the House for further legislative action.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe listen to the agitation of the people, but we also hear from the government so that from the abundance of information, we reach the level of awareness that allows us to discharge our role dispassionately. It is in service of our obligations under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and our moral duty to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe speaker also decried the spate of killings across the country.\n\nHe said the attacks called for coordinated and targeted action by government at all levels to address the menace and save the nation.\n\nPDP House Members Stage Walkout at Plenary\n\nHowever, a mild drama ensued yesterday when the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House staged a walkout at the plenary after Gbajabiamila ruled out of order, their prayer calling on the federal government to reverse the suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila, in his address, had apparently preempted the opposition lawmakers when he mandated the various committees to probe the circumstances of the decision by the federal government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nBut the leader of the PDP caucus, Hon. Kingsely Chinda, raised a point of order, citing section 39 of the constitution, section 19 of the Universal Declaration on Human and Peoples Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights and commended the steps taken so far by the speaker.\n\nHe added that while he agreed with the submission of the leadership of the House, the House should urge the executive arm to reverse the suspension, while the committees continue their assignment within the stipulated 10 days.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile I agree with the submission of the leadership of this House completely, I will only want to add that for the breach of our fundamental human rights, particularly the right to fair hearing, right to freedom of speech and expression, we should urge the executive arm in the interim to reverse the ban pending our interaction with the executive.\u201d\n\nBut the speaker ruled him out of order, saying that since the matter has been referred to committees already, it was wrong for it to be revived again.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me quickly refer you to Order 9, Rule 1 Sub Rule 6 of our rules, which states that it shall be out of order to reconsider any specific question upon which the House has come to a conclusion during the current session except upon a substantive motion for rescission.\n\n\u201cThis matter has already been sent to the committees to look at the issues you are talking about and will report to us within 10 days. Even if you had brought a motion here, it would have been referred to a committee. We are not even sure if your motion would not have been killed. This day, we have saved the day. So you are ruled out of order.\u201d\n\nChinda, however, insisted on being heard, but the House Leader, Hon. Alhassan Doguwa, and Chief Whip, Hon. Mohammed Tahir Mongunu, asked him to be guided.\n\nIt was at this point that a visibly angry Chinda and some other members of the caucus walked out of the plenary.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers later addressed the press on their grievances, saying that the members would continue to tweet in disregard of the suspension and are ready to be jailed.\n\nHowever, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi, later raised a point of order, alleging that there was an earlier plan by some members to disrupt the business of the House if their demands were not granted.\n\nSuspension Unprofessional, Ill-advised, Says Catholic Church\n\nThe Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) has described the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria as ill-advised.\n\nIn a statement yesterday by the Secretary of CSN, Rev. Fr. Mike Umoh, the church said the action was condemnable.\n\n\u201cWhile the Catholic Church is not against regulations of media use, she abhors when such action is selective or used as tool for suppressing the people.\n\n\u201cThis is one decision that will further paint this government in darker pigments as anti-people and anti-democratic,\u201d he said.\n\nUmoh stated that as a mark of the futility of such actions, even some people in the government are reported to have still used the facility after the suspension, while many Nigerians resorted to the use of VPN and remote proxy options.\n\nDespite Ordering Violators\u2019 Prosecution, Malami Accesses Twitter, Deactivates Account\n\nMeanwhile, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice , Mr. Abubakar Malami, yesterday deactivated his account.\n\nMalami posted the screenshot of his deactivated account, which showed a VPN symbol, on his Facebook page.\n\nHe, however, did not state how he was able to access his Twitter account since all telecommunication companies had blocked access to Twitter through their networks, forcing Nigerians to download VPN.\n\nHis Facebook post attracted varied reactions from his followers, with,l some Nigerians, mostly supporters of the government, praising him for compliance with the directive.\n\nBut another follower, Masta Pee, who wrote: \u201cHow did he deactivated his account without logging in to Twitter?\u201d\n\nHe was followed by Roy Ekwueme who wrote: \u201cThis is an evidence that you logged in Twitter today via VPN to deactivate your account, which is punishable under your unlawful law.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how you will prosecute others without throwing yourself in jail.\u201d\n\nAkintunde Babatunde said: \u201cHow are you able to deactivate Twitter without VPN? You should be arrested.\u201d\n\nTrump Lauds Nigeria over Twitter\u2019s Suspension\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has praised Nigeria for banning \u201cevil\u201d Twitter and encouraged other countries to do the same in the name of \u201cfree and open speech.\u201d\n\nA report on the website of DAILY BEAST, a news publication based in the United States, yesterday quoted\n\nTrump, who himself was banned by the platform for incendiary rhetoric, as saying in a statement that \u201cmore countries should ban Twitter and Facebook for not allowing free and open speech\u2014all voices should be heard. Who are they to dictate good when they themselves are evil?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I should have done it while I was president,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump also appeared to confuse Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. \u201cZuckerberg kept calling me and coming to the White House for dinner telling me how great I was. 2024?\u201d he wrote. The praise comes after it was announced earlier this month that Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram would remain banned until early 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami Shielded Indian-Muslim Family Accused Of Over N600 Billion Graft\u2014Report",
          "text": "Members of famous Indian family the Sandesaras, indicted or on the run for tax evasion, loan fraud, and other alleged offences enjoy state protection from Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria, says an investigative report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThe Sandesaras\u2014Chetankumar, his wife Diptiben, and elder brother Nitin had been on the run since 2017, when authorities in India accused them of defrauding local banks out of loans worth over $700 million at the time.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nDespite the allegations and their fugitive status, the family had been allowed to invest in projects in Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria. In fact, they hold Albanian and Nigerian passports.\n\nThe OCCRP investigation says high-ranking Albanian and Nigerian officials helped the family evade repeated attempts to extradite them to India. Police reports, court documents, interviews, and flight data obtained by reporters show how these officials allowed the family to move freely and continue to run their businesses while at large.\n\nNigeria's Attorney-General rebuffed an Indian request for their extradition, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated.\n\nDocuments obtained by OCCRP also show that Indian state companies continued to buy hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil sourced from the Sandesaras\u2019 Nigerian firm after the family went on the run - implying that the family yet maintains ties with some state authorities in India.\n\nThe family owns Nigeria-based Sterling Oil Exploration and Energy Production Company (SEEPCO).\n\nThe brothers\u2014Nitin Sandesara and Chetankumar Sandesara\u2014control some 340 companies, including 92 outside India in energy, construction, and healthcare. Their conglomerate has claimed to be worth nearly $7 billion.\n\nAs their wealth grew, the family became a staple of the Indian tabloids, which gushed about their extravagant properties, lavish parties, and appearances with Bollywood stars. In one anecdote, Chetankumar reportedly complained to journalists when a media portal underestimated the cost of the family\u2019s new jet.\n\nBut the Sandesaras\u2019 fortunes shifted in the fall of 2017 when the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi accused them and their company of cheating and criminal conspiracy. A subsequent investigation by the Indian government\u2019s Enforcement Directorate claimed that their Sterling Biotech group had criminally acquired and laundered over $700 million for the benefit of its \u201cpromoters,\u201d including the Sandesara brothers and Diptiben.\n\nInvestigators claimed that the family\u2019s companies had obtained the money by fraudulently obtaining loans from various Indian banks. In 2019, the amount those banks declared as fraudulent had risen to over $1.1 billion (about N600 billion).\n\nMuch of this money was allegedly siphoned off using shell companies which listed employees and associates of Sterling Biotech as their shareholders and directors. Prosecutors say the money was transferred under the guise of asset purchases and property transactions. These transactions were also allegedly used to inflate the balance sheets of the shell companies, which then borrowed even more money from the banks and diverted those funds as well.\n\nThe Sandesaras also appear to have played politics in Kosovo. In February 2019, Kosovo\u2019s then Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj posted on Facebook that he had met with Chetankumar Sandesara, describing him as a \u201crepresentative of \u2018Sandesara Group\u2019 from Nigeria,\u201d to discuss investments in tourism and agriculture.\n\nThey have found shelter in Nigeria, along with lucrative business opportunities.\n\nIn 2011, SEEPCO partnered with Nigerian-owned Allenne Energy Ltd. on a concession licence to exploit an oil field worth over $3 billion. Nigeria\u2019s then-president Goodluck Jonathan named Sterling as one of the country\u2019s top 100 businesses in 2014.\n\nThe accusations against them back home do not seem to have troubled Nigerian officials. A month after they were charged in India, Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, who was Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 2016 and 2018, wrote to the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking for Nitin Sandesara to be appointed honorary consul to Nigeria. She cited Nitin\u2019s \u201ceffort to expand the friendship\u201d between Nigeria and Albania and \u201cthe need to provide [an] avenue for boosting trade and investment relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nAlbanian authorities immediately began the process, and Nitin received the position in January 2019, a year after he and his brother received their Albanian citizenship.\n\nIn June 2018, Nigeria\u2019s judiciary also handed down a ruling that reinforced the narrative that the Sandesaras had faced persecution by Indian authorities. The decision was made as part of a suit filed by Allenne Energy to prevent information about the Nigerian oil concession from being shared with any law enforcement agencies or banks in India or Nigeria.\n\nAllenne\u2019s suit alleged that the Indian banks were acting with \u201culterior motives\u201d and asked the court for a declaration that the \u201cchange of government in India as well as the government policies and political and religious victimization and persecution of [SEEPCO] constitute force majeure capable of raising concerns by [Allenne Energy] in protecting its interest.\u201d\n\nA judge in Nigeria\u2019s Federal High Court agreed, writing that the Sandesara brothers and their families were being \u201ctargeted by Indian government agencies\u201d for their political and religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate for this court to allow any Nigerian company to be economically imperiled, because of political vendetta of Indian Government and banks,\u201d the judge\u2019s statement read. \u201cNigeria is keen on keeping and protecting the present legitimate investors and to even encourage more to come into the economy.\u201d\n\nLater, in 2019, Nigeria\u2019s justice ministry made a similar argument when it rejected a request from India to extradite members of the Sandesara family, citing its power to refuse requests if it believes that the offence is \u201cpolitical in nature.\u201d\n\nPrashant Bhushan, the prominent public interest lawyer in India, called the High Court\u2019s decision \u201claughable,\u201d and pointed out that the Sandesaras are close to a former top Central Bureau of Investigation officer, R.K. Asthana, whose daughter\u2019s wedding was held in their farmhouse.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is so close to Asthana cannot fear persecution by the Indian government,\u201d said Bhushan, who in late 2017 made public a diary belonging to the Sandesaras that allegedly detailed kickbacks to top Indian officials. \u201cA sham show is being put on to show that an attempt to extradite them is being made.\u201d\n\nWhether or to what extent the Sandesaras have been protected in India is a matter of debate. Indian authorities have reportedly sought to freeze over $2 billion worth of Sandesara assets as part of their investigation.\n\nBut oil shipping data provided to OCCRP also shows that state-run Indian companies continued buying Nigerian crude sourced from SEEPCO even after the money laundering charges against the Sandesaras, raising questions about how hard the Indian state and the defrauded banks are working to reclaim the money they allege the family stole.\n\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well. A copy of both this case and the decision by Nigeria not to extradite the four family members were given to the Tirana District Court by a special envoy of the Nigerian government.\n\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",

Asthana, whose daughter\u2019s wedding was held in their farmhouse.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is so close to Asthana cannot fear persecution by the Indian government,\u201d said Bhushan, who in late 2017 made public a diary belonging to the Sandesaras that allegedly detailed kickbacks to top Indian officials. \u201cA sham show is being put on to show that an attempt to extradite them is being made.\u201d\n\nWhether or to what extent the Sandesaras have been protected in India is a matter of debate. Indian authorities have reportedly sought to freeze over $2 billion worth of Sandesara assets as part of their investigation.\n\nBut oil shipping data provided to OCCRP also shows that state-run Indian companies continued buying Nigerian crude sourced from SEEPCO even after the money laundering charges against the Sandesaras, raising questions about how hard the Indian state and the defrauded banks are working to reclaim the money they allege the family stole.\n\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well. A copy of both this case and the decision by Nigeria not to extradite the four family members were given to the Tirana District Court by a special envoy of the Nigerian government.\n\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",
          "summary": "The OCCRP investigation says high-ranking Albanian and Nigerian officials helped the family evade repeated attempts to extradite them to India.\nNigeria's Attorney-General rebuffed an Indian request for their extradition, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated.\nInvestigators claimed that the family\u2019s companies had obtained the money by fraudulently obtaining loans from various Indian banks.\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well.\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",

I think Nigerians should be able to wait for 10 days for things to be put into perspective rather than allow Twitter to run freely.\n\n\u201cTo me personally, I think we need to preserve the nation first. We believe Twitter has contributed a lot to heating up the state of our polity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor us to take a little time so that we can create an enabling environment. That suspension has started yielding results. The ban has yielded results, so to me we have no regret whatsoever.\u201d\n\nIn reaction, Solomon Maren, member of the PDP caucus in the house of representatives, said if the president feels offended by the actions of Twitter, he should engage an international court rather than oppress Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI think if the president feels like what he wrote was right, he should take up the matter with Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe can sue them in an international court but not bring the matter and visit it on Nigerians who are legitimately doing their businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs Nigerians, I believe this is the area we must speak out and condemn what is condemnable.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution to investigate the legality of the suspension of Twitter in the country. Announced on Friday, the controversial decision has stoked national conversations and attracted international criticism over the last few days.\n\nThe investigation by lawmakers represents the first major move by the legislative body on the suspension of Twitter and comes after widespread criticism from Nigerians over the silence and inaction of the National Assembly since the ban was imposed.\n\nMembers of the lower chamber have been \u201cinundated with comments about the decision (suspending Twitter), requests for intervention and criticism\u201d since the announcement, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said during the resumption of the plenary session of the House in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the House recognises that Twitter, like other social media networks, is an important tool for communication and commerce in Nigeria \u201cparticularly amongst the younger generation who have used these networks for enterprise and innovation with great success.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker however cautioned that although the social media platform is a very important means of communication and business for the younger generation of Nigerians, the government has a responsibility to ensure it is not used to undermine national security even as lawmakers must see to it that government policies are in line with the law and without adverse consequences on the people.\n\nAs part of the investigation that will be carried out by the House Committees on Communication, Justice, Information & Culture, and National Security & Intelligence, the Minister of Culture & Information, Lai Mohammed, has been invited to brief the House on the objectives, intent, and duration of the suspension of the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe committees are expected to question Lai Mohammed and report to the House within 10 days to guide further action by the lawmakers on the matter, Gbajabiamila said.\n\nThe embattled minister who announced the suspension of Twitter, cited a \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d as reason for the ban. The U.S. social media giant has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the ban.\n\nNigerians continue to use Twitter, however, thanks to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that have helped bypass the ban. In response, the Nigerian Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has ordered the immediate prosecution of people still making use of the microblogging platform. The country\u2019s broadcast regulator has also ordered television and radio stations to suspend their use of Twitter.",

          "text": "South African Mobility startup WhereIsMyTransport has raised a $14.5 million Series A extension round to continue its expansion across emerging markets.\n\nThe round was led by Naspers Foundry, Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. Wuri Ventures and Capria Ventures also participated investing $1.5m. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming. The successful expansion of WhereIsMyTransport would reduce friction in the movement of people and goods across Africa and other emerging markets.",

          "text": "HELPING AFRICAN CONSUMERS SEND AND RECEIVE AS LITTLE AS $1 USING CRYPTO\n\n\u2013 FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD \u2013\n\nEasyShare; a fast, reliable, and super affordable way to send and receive money to anyone in Africa using crypto has officially launched in beta mode in Africa.\n\nBy using innovative low-cost crypto-technology to drastically cut transaction fees, Easyshare will also allow consumers to perform micro-transactions safely, securely and affordably.\n\nSpeaking on the launch of the beta platform, Ben Onuoha Co-founder and Head of Partnerships & Community at EasyShare.Africa said, \u201cEasyshare was born out of a lot of research. Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system \u2014 but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money\u201d\n\nOnuoha added: \u201cIn response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for 5% or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe threshold for sending and receiving money using crypto on EasyShare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can seamlessly send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. EasyShare.Africa supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20) and other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). More cryptocurrency options will be added in due course.\n\nThe Easyshare.Africa platform is crowdsourcing to meet its expansion plans\n\nIn addition to serving ordinary consumers, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world\u2019s first decentralized network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents. Current crypto remittance systems and peer to peer platforms use centralized escrows to guarantee settlement. This centralized escrow model is oftentimes plagued with bad actors, as well as centralized judges and juries settling disputes. EasyShare.Africa improves on this crypto peer-to-peer remittance model by adding a decentralized layer where verified remittance agents can stake SHARE Token \u2013 the native crypto of the Easyshare ecosystem \u2013 as collateral/insurance to guarantee the agents complete transactions.\n\nThe Easyshare model is poised to contribute to eight out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by making a case for the unbanked and underbanked through offering various services such as micro remittances, microfinance loans, savings, insurance, payments, e-commerce and more for low-income populations in Africa and other emerging markets.

          "text": "Digital transformation has reinforced the importance of investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset monitoring, data collection, and decision making, to maximize value from operational assets in advanced and emerging economies.\n\nLagos, Nigeria: Today, PlugnPlay IoT, a subsidiary of NovaTrack Limited announced that it will be organizing a private Asset Tracking seminar in Lagos, Nigeria that will discuss the importance, necessity, and the \u2018how\u2019 of adopting the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for business advancement, especially in emerging economies through digital transformation focused on asset management and tracking.\n\nThe seminar, as part of the PlugnPlay IoT measures to help businesses in emerging economies scale by revealing how businesses, regardless of size can reduce operational cost in the areas of asset maintenance, security, data collection, etc., will be held this year, precisely on the 15 June 2021.\n\nAs rightly stated by PlugnPlay IoT, \u201cthe recent security challenges in major African economies, especially Nigeria highlight the need for increased security protocols for valuables. In the case of businesses, these valuables are referred to as company assets. These are infrastructure, equipment, or personnel that have some reasonable and clear lifetime value pegged on them. Aside from security, businesses that wish to stand strong through time naturally seek to improve operational processes, especially with technology and innovation that provides an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\nHowever, some business assets may not deliver direct value but will have other processes or operations dependent on their indirect value. Such business assets are often mistaken for less important but they should be secured to avoid or reduce unwanted events like operational downtimes which may lead to loss of trust and reduced work efficiency all of which runs down any business.\u201d\n\nThese challenges are common to all; Oil & Gas, Construction, Manufacturing, Financial Services, Logistics, Energy Supply and Distribution, Facility Management, etc., and there is always a place for IoT to satisfy these. Industries like these have been seen to speedily displace entities that fail to evolve with technological advantages because advancements such as IoT drastically improves operational success and reduces risk while increasing customer satisfaction. For example, the advent of GPS tracking revolutionized the logistics sector, and those able to perfectly fit it into business processes now lead the industry. This is why PlugnPlay IoT has put together the Asset Tracking 101 Seminar to present industry leaders who participate with the unfair advantage of business asset tracking with IoT technology.\n\nA representative of PlugnPlay IoT also mentioned that \u201cthe seminar, to be held on June 15, will privately engage high-level participants from both the public and private sector; CEOs, CTOs, CIOs, Senior Managers, Government Heads, and will focus on the key issues surrounding business innovation and the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset tracking to increase profitability and boost economic prosperity.\u201d The program will include training and updates on new products/solutions with speeches delivered by highly ranked business leaders in Nigeria and as a private event, it is strictly on invitation. However, business leaders who consider themselves qualified to participate can request to attend on their webpage.\n\nAbout PlugnPlay IoTPlugnPlayIoT is an IoT service provider, powered by NovaTrack Ltd, that empowers system integrators, technology experts, software developers and entrepreneurs to build and scale their own IoT business verticals at a relatively low cost. Our solutions enable our channel partners to deploy wireless connected sensors with remote monitoring capability, data analytics and real-time alerts for various industry applications.",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has announced a ban on Twitter, a leading microblogging platform, using a tweet on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nThis ban came after the tech company deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari alleged to convey threatening messages that could incite national violence. Twitter\u2019s move was in line with their corporate stance against \u201cabusive behaviour,\u201d sources from the tech firm reveal.\n\nIn what seems like a kickback, the Federal Government announced a country-wide ban on using the highly subscribed platform under the guise that it \u201cthreatens Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d. This move has so far cost the country in terms of daily economic losses and investment potentials.\n\nAs if foretold, Twitter has, in April 2021, announced setting up its first African office in Accra and not Lagos, based on the justification that Ghana was more investment-friendly and ready to support innovative flows into its investment-hungry economy. Twitter analysts have also envisaged Ghana as a country that prioritises free speech, online freedom and an open internet space for its citizens, unlike Nigeria, as it has shown in the past months with the proposed Social Media Bill and the post-#EndSars event.\n\nThis choice, made by Twitter Inc., is without prejudice to Nigeria\u2019s 40 million Twitter users, while Ghana\u2019s entire population as of January 2021 is 31.4 million.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has been attracting more tech start-ups that have been doing well so far. Currently, Premium Times reports that about 250 fintech companies in the country and start-ups like Paystack, ULesson, 54Gene, Flutterwave, LifeBank, and Max.ng are among others faring well in the country\u2019s technology ecosystem.\n\nThe recent ban by the Federal Government on Twitter use has nonetheless created a market access gap for start-ups and other small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) who rely on the platform to reach their customers.\n\nMore so, the e-commerce market, estimated to be valued at about $12 billion, is worse hit by this shock, as the new restrictive directive is sabotaging daily reach between investor and consumers.\n\nReports reveal that N7.5 billion has been lost in just a few days since the ban. NetBlocks, a watchdog organisation formed to monitor cybersecurity and governance of the internet, reports that each hour of the social media suppression costs Nigeria about $250,000 (N102.5m). This estimates a daily loss of N2.5 billion.\n\nNetBlocks further reveals that a day of total internet blackout can cost the country up to about N49 billion in economic losses while about N11 billion risks being lost daily if WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter are all shutdown.\n\nThe loss of access to the microblogging service, it is believed, can cause a slowdown in trade velocity, reduce productivity and cut down on jobs. It is also highly probable that the demand for remote skilled labour may slide southwards since foreign investors will be averse to hiring workers from an origin with high uncertainties and risks.\n\nWithin hours of the ban, Nigerians have resorted to a detour by using virtual private network (VPN) services, which helps internet users disguise their identity and evade country-specific limits. With this, users can resume their normal Twitter activities unhindered.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government showed utter displeasure to this development and vowed to deal with erring individuals who dared to bypass the sovereign decision. Also, the Nigerian government have engaged the Chinese government in the use of firewall, some sources say.\n\nThis firewall system will grant the Federal Government complete control over the Nigerian internet space to control all social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, just as China currently does.\n\nWith an active user age bracket ranging between 18 and 25 years, the Twitter community in Nigeria forms the most vocal and politically active segment of the entire population. Through the online platform, anti-government demonstrations such as the famous #EndSars protest have been organised, with massive turnouts nationwide.\n\nThis ban will put these active voices to a quiet; their collective demand for justice and good governance may be hindered by the restrictive order, which is a slur to Nigeria\u2019s rights to freedom of expression as well as a stain on other rights provided in the Nigerian 1999 Constitution (as amended), the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe infringement on citizens\u2019 fundamental human rights sends a solid signal to foreign investors who would rather invest in countries with strong institutions and a commendable value system.\n\nLocal and international concerns have been registered on this matter. A joint statement by the United States, Canada, European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland have condemned the Federal Government\u2019s move, warning that economic hardship owing to the novel COVID-19 pandemic will only be further complicated rather than helped.\n\nWhile advocating for the lifting of the ban, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State advised, \u201c\u2026we should also remember that Twitter has gone beyond a source of communication for many of our hardworking youths in Nigeria. It has become a source of livelihood for many, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious leanings\u2026.\u201d\n\nRestricting access to services that help propagate important information for business, government and other day-to-day concern and for which people earn a living drives down the country\u2019s rating, especially from an investor\u2019s perspective.\n\nNigeria needs to demonstrate true leadership by respecting citizen\u2019s rights to access and use information, if it must continue to lure new investments that will champion the expected growth outcomes in the country.",

          "title": "Public uproar over killings in S/E, twitter ban",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nAn unpopular move by an increasingly unpopular government, the decision of the President Muhammadu Buhari led Federal Government to ban social media platform, Twitter, has triggered a storm in Africa\u2019s most populous country, as its mostly youthful population, many of whom have built careers around social media, have gone up in arms over what they see as an attempt to take away their basic freedom.\n\nA country of youth, governed by the elderly. Only few of Nigeria\u2019s ubiquitous, tech-savvy, millennial and Gen. Z populations, a vast majority of the country\u2019s overall population, were born in 1984, when then military head of state, Major General Muhammadu Buhari passed Decree Number 4, the Protection Against False Accusations Decree, which basically sought to gag the media. Among other things, it provided, in Section 1, that \u201cAny person who publishes in any form, whether written or otherwise, any message, rumour, report or statement which is false in any material particular or which brings or is calculated to bring the Federal Military Government or the Government of a state or public officer to ridicule or disrepute, shall be guilty of an offense under this Decree.\u201d\n\nFor Nigeria\u2019s older generation, the Twitter ban, by same Buhari, will perhaps trigger a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu feeling; perhaps an attempt to drag the country back to the dark days. But the new generation, who have grown up to know only a world characterised by social media empowered free speech, there is no relating and the government may be starting a fight it can\u2019t win. The reactions have been thunderous and overwhelming, even as the government appears resolute in its quest to take the freedom they have always known, with the Attorney General of the federation, Abubakar Malami, vowing to prosecute citizens who violate the ban.\n\nIn a statement announcing the ban, issued by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, through his spokesperson, Segun Adeyemi on Friday, the Minister cited \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Federal Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIt went further to outline further moves to regulate other social media platforms, a move that the government had tried to make severally in the past, but which was always greeted with backlash.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nThe government\u2019s move, apparently in response to the decision of the social media platform, to block a tweet by Buhari on May 31 \u2013 in which he evoked the ghost of Biafra War; a war in which an estimated three million people died, mostly civilians, including women and children starved to death, in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast, while threatening to deal with criminal elements suspected to be sympathetic to the resurgent Biafra quest, destroying public infrastructure, notably offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), police stations and courts in the region, is fairly understandable.\n\nNigeria is tittering on the brink. Agitations for separation have gathered momentum, not only in the Southeast, but also in the Southwest, amid unrelenting violence perpetrated by suspected Fulani herders, seen to be pampered by the president, who is himself Fulani. Social media, especially, Twitter, had provided a platform where many take to, to pour out their anger; to agree and disagree. But the language is becoming more incendiary.\n\nIn an outrageous memo dated June 3 to the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, a group known as Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) blamed Igbo people for virtually all the problems bedevilling the North, from Boko Haram to drug addiction, and basically called for genocide against the Igbo.\n\nThe group at the weekend, organised protest against the Igbo in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, demanding for a referendum, because according to them, the only way to avoid another civil war in the country is to allow the Igbo have their own country.\n\nMeanwhile, rights groups have accused the country\u2019s security agencies of arresting and killing innocent civilians in the Southeast.\n\nA special report by the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, signed by Emeka Umeagbalasi, Chinwe Umeche and Chidimma Udegbunam said the rights group was in possession of graphic details of how soldiers, police and other Nigerian security operatives presently deployed in the East abducted innocent citizens and allegedly killed them.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthese have led to not less than 170 open killings, secret abduction and permanent disappearance or feared unlawful execution in custody of no fewer than 550 and general arrest/abduction of not less than 2100.\n\n\u201cThe arrested/abducted are presently held in different open and secret dungeons located within and outside the East and among those outside the East are Makurdi Prisons in Benue State where over 300 were recently found to have been transferred and kept. Others are conventional and unconventional military, police and SSS detention facilities in Abuja, Niger State and other undisclosed locations in the North.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a country observers warn is fast descending into anarchy. But there is a flip side to the argument. Many have blamed the Buhari government itself for stoking ethnic tension by its perceived unabashed nepotism, and penchant for double standard.\n\nIndeed, Twitter\u2019s decision to take down the president\u2019s statement, which was later followed up by Facebook, had come after it sparked angry reactions from many Nigerians, who reasoned that it threatened genocide against Igbo people. The president had after describing the devastation of the war, vowed to treat \u201cthem in the language they understand.\u201d Many reported the tweet. Several commentators reminded the president that he had not made similar threat against bandits wreaking havoc in the country\u2019s Northwest and Boko Haram in the Northeast. Amid the outrage, Twitter blocked the statement.\n\nHowever, Mr. Mohammed, in response, accused the platform of double standard, arguing that the social media giant conveniently ignored \u201cinciting\u201d tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and his cohorts, who according to him have been making inciting statements on its platform.\n\nHe followed up by slamming the ban on the platform on Friday, subsequently directing Telecom providers, through the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), to block Nigerians from accessing the platform; a direction that was implemented late Friday night, when many discovered that they could no longer access Twitter through their mobile networks.\n\nThe decision is already taking a toll on the country\u2019s economy. According to NetBlocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cyber-security and governance of the Internet, each hour the ban lasts costs Nigeria about $250,000 (N102.5 million), bringing the daily loss to N2.5 billion.\n\nThe ban has created a market access gap for millions of small and medium scale enterprises (SMSEs) that use the platform to reach their customers, even as many young Nigerians who earn a living doing gigs on the platform for local and foreign firms are already counting their losses. The government don\u2019t seem to care, and has since continued to double down. Earlier in the week, it ordered broadcast stations to deactivate their accounts.\n\nBut the argument by many, however, is that the government is looking for solution in the wrong places. Banning or restricting social media, they say, will not end agitations. And in fact, may cause people to seek other ways of expressing their anger, which may pose more danger.\n\n\u201cHow do you ban Twitter which is a means of peaceful engagement? wondered activist and politician, Omoyele Sowore. \u201cLet me say this, in the 1990s, most of the African countries that experienced war had one radio station and one TV station. That prevented the citizens from having outlets where they can vent. They should learn from that, and I hope they don\u2019t drag us into civil war.\u201d\n\nBan Sparks Outrage\n\nThe move predictably, has proved to be counterproductive. It has since sparked fury, with many berating the administration for what they called an audacious attempt to stifle free speech and cripple social media, after using same to win power in 2015, even as some have suggested that the ban is an initial move towards banning social media in the country altogether.\n\n\u201cThe real news is not the government suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, it\u2019s that the government wants to start LICENSING SOCIAL MEDIA & OTT OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA. The regulation of social media is the real aim of all of this. It\u2019s right there in the Ministry\u2019s tweet,\u201d noted a user Tola, @adetolaov.\n\nFormer Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, on his part alleged that there is a plot to shut down social media.\n\n\u201cI have been reliably informed that it is the intention of the FG to eventually close down social media completely in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil that time comes they intend to make it a criminal offence to use social media without NBC approval or registration.\u201d\n\nMany, including prominent Nigerian figures and rights groups are up in arms, even as more diplomatic missions are stepping in to condemn what they describe as an attempt to infringe on the right of Nigerians to freedom of speech.\n\nReacting on Friday to the ban Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, said the move is a \u201cpetulant gesture\u201d that is \u201cunbecoming of a democratically elected president.\u201d\n\nSoyinka, nonetheless, noted that a Twitter ban in the country is a \u201ctechnical issue Nigerians should be able to work their way around,\u201d adding that \u201cthe field of expression remains wide open, free of any dictatorial spasms.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, in his own reaction, asked the Federal Government to go beyond the suspension of micro-blogging site, Twitter, and \u201cdissolve the Nigerian people which it has become so allergic to and no longer wants to see or hear about.\u201d\n\nMatthew T. Page, former U.S. intelligence expert, while calling out his country\u2019s and other Western governments for not reacting to the ban, warned that Nigeria\u2019s elite were undermining the country\u2019s stability.\n\n\u201cI simply don\u2019t understand how Western engagement with the Nigerian government is still so *normal* and thus disconnected from the way the government behaves or how its elites\u2014with whom diplomats readily hobnob\u2014immiserate everyday Nigerians and undermine national stability,\u201d Page said.\n\nOn his part, Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, advised the Buhari government to reconsider the ban. According to him, \u201cAs leaders, we should go beyond emotional reactions to issues and think about how our actions will affect the people we lead and our international ratings socially and economically.\u201d\n\nMakinde noted that Twitter is platform where many young people express their, and their voices should not be stifled, even as he pointed out that many young Nigerians earn a living on the platform.\n\n\u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion. They use the platform to complain, argue and give feedback to government and its agencies who in turn, use these to improve policies. This is a fundamental point that should be kept in mind as we debate the necessity of this suspension,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe should also remember that Twitter has gone beyond a source of communication for many of our hardworking youths in Nigeria. It has become a source of livelihood for many, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious leanings. Nigerian youths and digital communications organisations earn a living from being able to use the platform to post communications on behalf of their clients.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, has said it\u2019s working to restore access to Nigerians affected by the ban.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and #OpenInternet is an essential human right in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with theworld. #KeepitOn, the platform wrote via Public Policy handle, @Policy on Saturday.\n\nUS, Canada, Sweden, AI, others condemn ban.\n\nCondemning the ban, the United States government in a brief message circulated on Saturday evening via the official account of the US Mission in Nigeria, @USinNigeria, emphasized that Nigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses,\u201d read the statement.\n\n\u201cBanning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms.\n\n\u201cAs President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater. The path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in a statement via his twitter handle, Canadian ambassador to Nigeria, Nicolas Simard, @NicolasJSimard, noted that freedom of speech remained a fundamental human right, and key ingredient of democracy, which should not be stifled.\n\n\u201cFreedom of speech, used responsibly online and off line, and access to reliable information are fundamental human rights protected by Nigeria\u2019s constitution and a cornerstone of democratic life around the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese #HumanRights should be fully protected, while preventing inflammatory rhetoric and hate speech that could fuel tension and conflict.\u201d\n\nIn the same breath, the Swedish government in a statement via the Twitter handle of its embassy in Nigeria, called on the Buhari government to respect the right of Nigerians to freedom of speech, as according to it, free speech remained an important part of democracy.\n\nThe embassy in a statement via its handle, @SwedeninNigeria, noted that, \u201cNigerians have a constitutional right to exercise their freedom of expression and a right to access of information. This must be respected. Safeguarding free, independent media and civic spaces for democratic voices is an important part of Sweden\u2019s drive for democracy.\u201d\n\nLocal and international bodies, including Amnesty International, Paradigm Initiative (PI), have condemned the ban.\n\nGlobal human rights body, Amnesty International, called on the government to reverse the ban, describing it as an attempt to gag free speech, which according to it cannot be allowed in a democracy.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cAmnesty International condemns the Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of Twitter, Amnesty noted the microblogging site, is a social media widely used by Nigerians to exercise their human rights, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Nigerian authorities to immediately reverse the unlawful suspension and other plans to gag the media, repress the civic space, and undermine Nigerians\u2019 human rights,\u201d Amnesty said.\n\n\u201cThis action is clearly inconsistent and incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international obligations including under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d\n\nDigital rights group, Paradigm initiative, while condemning the ban as a brazen abuse of human rights, noted that Buhari, who refuses to engage Nigerians, is looking for a way to shut them up.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that Nigeria\u2019s President has notably been insulated from every form of public accountability. He is perhaps the only president since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1999 who never grants live interviews or holds media chats. This move is therefore aimed at making him unaccountable to the people of Nigeria who constantly take to social media platforms to share their views on the actions and policies of the government,\u201d PI said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that shutting down Twitter is illegal and illegitimate policies such as this are unacceptable!\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), while clarifying that the Buhari\u2019s tweet was not a genocide threat, said the decision to ban Twitter was a needless overreaction.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies who are relentless is seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue,\u201d a statement by NPAN president, Kabiru A. Yusuf read in part.\n\nSERAP, NBA threaten court action\n\nNigerian Bar Association (NBA) and Socioeconomic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), have, meanwhile, vowed to drag the government to court.\n\nThe NBA in a statement by its president, Olumide Akpata, @OlumideAkpata, while condemning the ban as an infringement of free speech, warned that the impact of such arbitrary decisions on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\nAkpata in the statement asked that the ban be reversed, failure of which the NBA would take legal action against the government.\n\n\u201c@NigBarAssoc has noted with great concern the extraordinary decision of the Federal Govt to suspend the operations of @Twitter in Nigeria and, by necessary implication, the right of Nigerians to freely express their constitutionally guaranteed opinions through that medium,\u201d the statement issued by Akpata said.\n\n\u201cThe FGN also directed the @NgComCommission to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria, which is, at best, yet another disguised attempt to regulate social media, restrict freedom of speech and shrink civic space.\n\n\u201cWhether one likes it or not, we are operating a constitutional democracy, the primary consequence of which is that everything must be done according to law; government must be conducted within the framework of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power.\n\n\u201cThe @NigBarAssoc finds no constitutional or legal authority to support the peremptory action of the Federal Government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria. Beyond the dent on our constitutional democracy, at a time when the Nigerian economy is unarguably struggling the impact of arbitrary decisions such as this on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if this decision is not immediately reversed, the @NigBarAssoc will have no choice but to challenge same in the interest of the public and for the sake of our democracy.\n\nOn its part, SERAP, @SERAPNigeria, said it is commencing immediate legal action against the government over the decision, while maintaining that freedom of speech is a fundamental human right.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way,\u201d the body said. \u201c@NigeriaGov, we\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nNigerians use VPN to bypass ban\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian tweeps have resorted to using Virtual Private Network (VPN) as the country\u2019s telecommunications operators such MTN, Airtel and Glo block access to Twitter on the order of the government.\n\nVPNs, which can be downloaded from Apple Store or Google Store, allows users to choose any country and state of their choice, and generates an IP address to bypass the blocked access in a country, though comes with own safety issues.\n\nIndeed, on Tuesday, the Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, who had on Saturday directed immediate prosecution still using Twitter, used VPN to deactivate his account, as screenshot posted on his facebook page showed, a development that has since triggered debate over whether his is liable for prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe problem of Nigeria is that you have analog people running a country of digital age youth,\u201d Sowore said while appearing on Arise TV on Saturday. \u201cThe ban won\u2019t work. I am still on Twitter. Majority of Nigerians are still on Twitter. Others are still going to learn how to bypass their restrictions.\u201d\n\nReacting to Malami\u2019s threat, lawyer, Moe @Mochievous, argued that the Attorney General doesn\u2019t understand the law of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTurns out our AG\u2019s office is ignorant of basic Constitutional law. Which is a little weird because the office is set up to protect the Constitution,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cNo Nigerian can be prosecuted for an offense that isn\u2019t written in law as a crime. Tweeting is not a crime in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, SERAP, which has now taken the government to ECOWAS Court, issued another statement offering to provide legal assistance for anyone arrested for using Twitter.\n\n\u201cNo one should ever be criminalised simply for peacefully exercising their rights,\u201d the rights group said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll provide free legal support to anyone targeted for exercising their rights.\n\n\u201cAnyone harassed, intimidated and facing criminal prosecution simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression should please feel free to call our toll-free hotline 0800-CALLSERAP (0800-2255-73727); +234-816-053-7202 for absolutely free legal advice and support.\u201d",

People can come around and do business. Normal life has resumed in the state. Security agencies are on top of the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor brushed off claims that his recent statements prohibiting conversation were contributing to the state\u2019s seemingly hopeless position.\n\nHis words: \u201cThat is their thinking. I don\u2019t know the kind of utterance that I have made that suggests that I closed the door. I closed no door. If you have monitored what is going on in Imo of late, you would have seen me receiving leadership by leadership according to the local council, trying to find a common way of resolving these security challenges in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is not only Imo that has security challenges. In fact, I can even tell you that Imo\u2019s case is better, apart from one or two cases that involved Very Important Personalities (VIPs). There has never been a time 20 persons died simultaneously or school children were kidnapped, and all that.\u201d\n\nOn why it was difficult for him to reveal names of politicians behind the insecurity in the state and get them arrested, he said: \u201cIt is not only in Imo; I didn\u2019t limit it to Imo. I\u2019m saying, and I\u2019ll say it again, that the opposition party\u2019s and some disgruntled MPs\u2019 positions haven\u2019t helped incidents of insecurity here and there in the country.\u201d\n\nAnyone who is worth his onions as a leader, he believes, should be able to speak up.\n\n\u201cHow many of them are speaking out? How many of them are condemning what is going on? Rather, what you see are leaders fanning the embers of insecurity, blaming the only government.\u201d",

          "text": "The easiest way for falsehood to triumph is to let it run amok unchallenged.\n\nDr. Folarin Gbadebo Smith\u2019s first term as Director General of the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER), one of Nigeria\u2019s pre-eminent research institutions was dogged by a slew of unfounded accusations, baseless charges of financial recklessness and sundry falsehood orchestrated by amorphous entities masquerading as interested parties.\n\nHis major traducers remain the \u201cAcademic Staff Union of Research Institutes headed by Babatimeyin Muyiwa; Senior Staff Association of Universities, Teaching Hospitals, Research Institutes and Associated Institutions headed by Matthew Olagunju, and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions headed by Tubi O. Theophilus\u201d as reported by an online publication.\n\nThe most egregious accusation as published by the same online medium playing advocate for the traducers is that Dr. FolarinGbadebo-Smith had squandered\u201calmost N1.5 billion in combined annual budgetary releases without commensurate projects to justify such spending in his four years as head of the institute.\u201d\n\nThis charge is laughable and puerile because a quick check of budgetary allocations will establish that NISER\u2019s budget for the four years was a little under N850m. So, how could the Director General have squandered money that was not allocated?\n\nIn a dramatic escalation of their protests and allegations the Unions on Monday June 7, 2020 took their issues to Abuja. They printed banners, rented a van and drove round the town in what was a crude attempt to get the attention of government.\n\nAlongside this, an obviously rented crowd purporting to be members of the institute (only one person in the crowd could be positively identified as NISER staff) confronted the Minister of Finance under whose ministry NISER functions. Honourable Minister Zainab Ahmed in her usual calm and distinguished manner granted audience and assured them that their issues would be looked into and that in the interim peace and order should be maintained.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ibadan where the NISER is located, the gates remain locked preventing over 200 staff members from accessing their offices and carrying out their statutory obligations despite it being an offence in law and against the labour laws for a union to deny workers access to a federal government premises. This action by the unions is clearly a cheap attempt to draw the DG into a violent confrontation on the premises of the institute.\n\nNISER which began life as a center in the University of Ibadan,was made autonomous by the Federal Government in 1977 and so became a full-fledged research institute distinct from the University of Ibadan. The autonomy was granted via NISER Act No. 70 of 1977 (now Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2006 CAP 115). NISER moved out of the University of Ibadan to its headquarters at Ojoo, Ibadan in 1987.\n\nNISER\u2019s mandate was clear from inception; to employ the best and the brightest minds from the academia who would be fully equipped to serve as a think-tank in the field of social and economic development for the country.\n\nUpon assumption of office, Dr. Folarin Gbadebo-Smith focused fully on making NISER a world class research institute in which scholars would have a sense of pride and an institute which grant making institutions would be happy to support.\n\nEducated, affable, well-travelled and globally exposed, Dr. Gbadebo Smith was keenly aware that nothing makes a good impression as the first impression. So he went about improving the facilities at NISER to provide an environment and facility conducive for conducting research. This was critical because a grant making body had visited NISER and seeing the state of their rest rooms and facilities backed out from supporting NISER.\n\nTo facilitate research based activities especially in a 21st century research institute, Dr. Gbadebo-Smith quickly connected the institute to, what a group made up of Research Professors, Heads of Departments and members of NISER Management, called \u201cfull time, 24/7 functioning internet service within NISER premises. This has been consistent and we have never had it so good at NISER.\u201d\n\nIn a May 7, 2021 letter to NISER\u2019s supervising minister, Prince Clem Agba, Honourable Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, the group provided copious evidence to disprove the accusations leveled against the DG while providing proof of measures and actions and initiatives taken to restore NISER to its pride of place.\n\nThe letter was signed on behalf of the group by four professors and heads of four departments at NISER. The signatories include Prof F.O.N. Roberts, Head, Political & Governance Policy Dept; Prof A.O. Adesanya, Head, Env. & Physical lnfra. Policy Dept; Prof J.O.Adeoti, Head, lnnovation&Tech Policy and Prof S.O. Odekunle,Head,Human Capital Policy Dept.\n\nThe quartet, in their letter, noted without equivocation that: \u201cWe the undersigned, having served the institute for many years as Research Professors, Heads of Departments and members of NISER Management, believe that DrGbadeboSmith has done a commendable job as Director General of our lnstitute. A second term for him is in order and most desirable to improve NISER performance and prevent a return to a state of despondency and loss of the gains of almost four years of DrGbadebo-Smith\u2019s leadership at NISER.\u201d\n\nThe professors went ahead to note, in clear response to the DG\u2019s perceived lack of capacity to lead a research institute like NISER: \u201cDrFolarinGbadebo-Smith has demonstrated exceptional brilliance and high intellect in public policy discourse and in various public engagements. Though not a professor, he has distinguished himself in the understanding of development policy research and the expectations of NISER\u2019s mandate. ln our opinion, he eminently qualifies for a second term to advance and complete the good works he started.\u201d\n\nFollowing Dr. FolarinGbadebo-Smith\u2019s return for a second term the 5th columnists have risen again with more outrageous accusations backed up by a tissue of lies. This is despite the accusations having been fully addressed in the letter signed by the four professors in which they showed, clearly, that FolarinGbadebo-Smith\u2019s first term was one of beneficial capacity building as well as research and innovation at NISER.\n\nIn the letter the professors noted that aside the provision of high speed internet, the DG has facilitated the \u201cre-establishment of relationships with major international grant makers including MacArthur Foundation, ODI of London, Kings College University of London\u201d as well as \u201cReactivation of NISER\u2019s Knowledge Network including MOUs with Ahmadu Bello University, Federal University of Technology Mirtna, University of Cape Town, University of Delaware USA, and INEC lnstitute.\u201d\n\nAs DG, FolarinGbadebo-Smith, the professors averred, has championed capacity building with the \u201cintroduction of NISER webinar with attendance by high profile individuals in development policy research and advocacy\u201d, facilitated \u201cMerit based recruitment of 40 research staff. This has introduced new and fresh rigour into NISER research activities\u201d; enabled \u201cimplementation and regular funding of departmental research projects\u201d and the\u201crevival of Individual Research Project (IRP) programme for NISER research staff. Only very few researchers had IRP ongoing when Dr. Smith resumed as Director General in 2017. Almost all NISER research staff now engage in IRPs.\u201d\n\nWith these testimonials from eminent academics and researchers refuting the outrageous accusations leveled against a clear reform minded performer, the question becomes: who is to be believed\u2019 unionists who are clearly dancing to the tune of pecuniary interests or professors whose work and research are daily impacted by Dr, Gbadebo-Smith\u2019s progressive policies and initiatives?\n\nOnly time will tell but while we await posterity\u2019s verdict we must take a firm stand against lies and outright falsehood.\n\n***Dapo Bruce is a public analyst and writes from Lagos\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

This action by the unions is clearly a cheap attempt to draw the DG into a violent confrontation on the premises of the institute.\n\nNISER which began life as a center in the University of Ibadan,was made autonomous by the Federal Government in 1977 and so became a full-fledged research institute distinct from the University of Ibadan. The autonomy was granted via NISER Act No. 70 of 1977 (now Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2006 CAP 115). NISER moved out of the University of Ibadan to its headquarters at Ojoo, Ibadan in 1987.\n\nNISER\u2019s mandate was clear from inception; to employ the best and the brightest minds from the academia who would be fully equipped to serve as a think-tank in the field of social and economic development for the country.\n\nUpon assumption of office, Dr. Folarin Gbadebo-Smith focused fully on making NISER a world class research institute in which scholars would have a sense of pride and an institute which grant making institutions would be happy to support.\n\nEducated, affable, well-travelled and globally exposed, Dr. Gbadebo Smith was keenly aware that nothing makes a good impression as the first impression. So he went about improving the facilities at NISER to provide an environment and facility conducive for conducting research. This was critical because a grant making body had visited NISER and seeing the state of their rest rooms and facilities backed out from supporting NISER.\n\nTo facilitate research based activities especially in a 21st century research institute, Dr. Gbadebo-Smith quickly connected the institute to, what a group made up of Research Professors, Heads of Departments and members of NISER Management, called \u201cfull time, 24/7 functioning internet service within NISER premises. This has been consistent and we have never had it so good at NISER.\u201d\n\nIn a May 7, 2021 letter to NISER\u2019s supervising minister, Prince Clem Agba, Honourable Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, the group provided copious evidence to disprove the accusations leveled against the DG while providing proof of measures and actions and initiatives taken to restore NISER to its pride of place.\n\nThe letter was signed on behalf of the group by four professors and heads of four departments at NISER. The signatories include Prof F.O.N. Roberts, Head, Political & Governance Policy Dept; Prof A.O. Adesanya, Head, Env. & Physical lnfra. Policy Dept; Prof J.O.Adeoti, Head, lnnovation&Tech Policy and Prof S.O. Odekunle,Head,Human Capital Policy Dept.\n\nThe quartet, in their letter, noted without equivocation that: \u201cWe the undersigned, having served the institute for many years as Research Professors, Heads of Departments and members of NISER Management, believe that DrGbadeboSmith has done a commendable job as Director General of our lnstitute. A second term for him is in order and most desirable to improve NISER performance and prevent a return to a state of despondency and loss of the gains of almost four years of DrGbadebo-Smith\u2019s leadership at NISER.\u201d\n\nThe professors went ahead to note, in clear response to the DG\u2019s perceived lack of capacity to lead a research institute like NISER: \u201cDrFolarinGbadebo-Smith has demonstrated exceptional brilliance and high intellect in public policy discourse and in various public engagements. Though not a professor, he has distinguished himself in the understanding of development policy research and the expectations of NISER\u2019s mandate. ln our opinion, he eminently qualifies for a second term to advance and complete the good works he started.\u201d\n\nFollowing Dr. FolarinGbadebo-Smith\u2019s return for a second term the 5th columnists have risen again with more outrageous accusations backed up by a tissue of lies. This is despite the accusations having been fully addressed in the letter signed by the four professors in which they showed, clearly, that FolarinGbadebo-Smith\u2019s first term was one of beneficial capacity building as well as research and innovation at NISER.\n\nIn the letter the professors noted that aside the provision of high speed internet, the DG has facilitated the \u201cre-establishment of relationships with major international grant makers including MacArthur Foundation, ODI of London, Kings College University of London\u201d as well as \u201cReactivation of NISER\u2019s Knowledge Network including MOUs with Ahmadu Bello University, Federal University of Technology Mirtna, University of Cape Town, University of Delaware USA, and INEC lnstitute.\u201d\n\nAs DG, FolarinGbadebo-Smith, the professors averred, has championed capacity building with the \u201cintroduction of NISER webinar with attendance by high profile individuals in development policy research and advocacy\u201d, facilitated \u201cMerit based recruitment of 40 research staff. This has introduced new and fresh rigour into NISER research activities\u201d; enabled \u201cimplementation and regular funding of departmental research projects\u201d and the\u201crevival of Individual Research Project (IRP) programme for NISER research staff. Only very few researchers had IRP ongoing when Dr. Smith resumed as Director General in 2017. Almost all NISER research staff now engage in IRPs.\u201d\n\nWith these testimonials from eminent academics and researchers refuting the outrageous accusations leveled against a clear reform minded performer, the question becomes: who is to be believed\u2019 unionists who are clearly dancing to the tune of pecuniary interests or professors whose work and research are daily impacted by Dr, Gbadebo-Smith\u2019s progressive policies and initiatives?\n\nOnly time will tell but while we await posterity\u2019s verdict we must take a firm stand against lies and outright falsehood.\n\n***Dapo Bruce is a public analyst and writes from Lagos\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "A 35-year-old woman, Oluwadamilare Aremu, has accused the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital of negligence leading to the amputation of her right leg.\n\nAremu told PUNCH Metro that she was admitted to LASUTH in December 2018 when an 18-passenger vehicle she boarded was involved in a crash on the Third Mainland Bridge, leading to her suffering a broken thighbone.\n\nShe alleged that doctors at LASUTH assured her that she would walk again, but her hope was dashed after two surgeries with the doctors still demanding funds for a third and final surgery, which they claimed would solve the problem.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was discharged on July 8, 2019, to go and find the money for the third surgery, adding that she was already broke as a result of the bills she had to pay while on admission.\n\nAremu stated, \u201cI was involved in an accident and rushed to LASUTH on December 16, 2018. LASUTH doctors told me that I would walk again. But after two surgeries in 2019, I was told that I needed a third and last one. They sent me home to find money, but I was broke because I had spent over N4m while on admission.\n\n\u201cThey assured me that after the third surgery, I would be able to walk again. A social media blog, Gistlover, helped me crowdfund over N1m for the last surgery. I got the money in a week and returned to the hospital for the last surgery.\u201d\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was readmitted to the Ortho \u2018A\u2019 ward of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu orthopaedic section of the hospital, adding that despite having severe pain, LASUTH allegedly kept postponing the surgery.\n\nShe also alleged that she was later moved to the Ortho \u2018B\u2019 ward under the supervision of one Dr Kayode, who was to conduct the third surgery. But no surgery was performed from 2019 till 2020.\n\nAremu said she sought alternative medical help at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, in October 2020, adding that she was advised that the leg would have to be amputated.\n\n\u201cLASUTH readmitted me and kept postponing my surgery from 2019 till October 2020 on COVID-19 excuses. I took a COVID-19 test and it was negative. I was still passing through a lot of pain. I went to Igbobi because LASUTH stopped attending to me. Igbobi told me that amputation was the only solution left because my leg had been mismanaged. But I would have to wait till 2021 because of the queue for amputation surgery. LASUTH didn\u2019t tell me the truth from the outset,\u201d Aremu lamented.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she attempted to poison herself when the pain became unbearable, adding that she opted to amputate the leg at the Oak Hospital, Ikeja.\n\nShe also alleged that one of her doctors at LASUTH was a consultant at Oak Hospital.\n\nShe stated, \u201cI opted to have the leg amputated at Oak Hospital, Ikeja. The pain was so much that I once tried to commit suicide. Oak Hospital couldn\u2019t remove the iron that LASUTH inserted in my leg, so they called a consultant to come. It was Dr Afariogun of LASUTH, who came.\n\n\u201cHe was surprised to see me. Afariogun told me that he couldn\u2019t tell me the truth, because he was afraid of his seniors at LASUTH. Dr Soga, Dr Afariogun and Dr Ajiboye were the three doctors, who attended to me at the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe victim told our correspondent that she was still in pain despite the amputation of the leg and lamented that LASUTH wasted her money and rendered her immobile.\n\n\u201cEven after the amputation surgery, the damage LASUTH did to my leg could not be undone. My left leg is weak and I keep falling each time I try to stand. I have to walk with a frame. LASUTH wasted my money and still damaged my leg. I want justice and proper compensation.\u201d\n\nWhen PUNCH Metro contacted the Chief Medical Director of LASUTH, Prof Tokunbo Fabanwo, he said investigation into the case had begun.\n\n\u201cWe are already investigating it. Give us till Thursday. The Director of Clinical Services is going to find out what happened. I will get back to you on Thursday,\u201d he said.

          "text": "Popular Nigerian pastors have been silent until now in the midst of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua\u2019s untimely death.\n\nT.B Joshua, a well-known preacher in Nigeria and Africa, including Asia, whose ability to perform miracles drew visitors from Europe, America, and other continents to Lagos, was verified deceased on Sunday morning.\n\nThe pastor was claimed to have died on Saturday after closing a presentation at the Synagogue Church Of All Nations, shocking his congregation and onlookers.\n\nPoliticians, friends, and well-wishers, as well as those who did not seem to approve of his ministry, have utilized various methods to express their condolences and sympathies to the departed family and his congregation.\n\nHowever, some prominent \u2018men of God\u2019 in the country, such as Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor W.F Kumuyi of Deeper Life Bible Church, Bishop David Oyedepo of Living Faith Church, Pastor Paul Enenche of Dunamis Church, Pastor Chris Oyakilome of Pastor Chris Okotie of Dunamis Church, to name a few, have refused to acknowledge T.B Joshua\u2019s death.\n\nWhen Dare, one of Pastor Adeboye\u2019s sons, died, T. B Joshua was one of the first pastors to express his condolences and held a minute of silence for the 43-year-old pastor during his church service.\n\nIn a sympathy message to Pastor Adeboye and the Redeemed Christian Church Of God (RCCG), Joshua said the tragic event would not have occurred if God had not permitted it, adding that He did not require human approval to carry out His purpose.\n\nIn a live broadcast on Emmanuel TV, the clergyman added, \u201cGod does not require our permission; God\u2019s time is the finest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat matters is not how long we live, but how well we live,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe reason for these Pentecostal pastors\u2019 silence over Joshua\u2019s death is unknown, but one thing is certain: the late clergyman was not a member of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, or the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, until his death.\n\nThere may have been a misunderstanding between Joshua and some of these renowned preachers, as Apostle Suleman Johnson of the Omega Fire Ministries in Edo State indicated. Suleman has said to his congregation on June 7, 2021, \u201cProphet T.B Joshua is too small.\n\n\u201cAnd my problem is that when I respond, I respond raw. I don\u2019t edit. You are too small. The Synagogue is too small. Too small. I cannot fight\u2026Church cannot fight Church. None of my pastors has followed me to my father in the Lord. Me, I book months before I see him. Then I carried a frustrated fat-bodied baboon to go and meet who? There\u2019s no mountain on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. You\u2019re sick! What I don\u2019t understand is, was it a mistake? \u2026\u201d\n\nBut even at that, some Nigerians who spoke to DAILY POST on this matter shared a diverse opinion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not biblical for anyone to hold grudges against their fellow human being even unto death. Although they might have sent their condolences to the family and Church without making it public. If there was a face-off between Joshua and Adeboye for instance, the former did not harbour it in his mind because immediately he learnt about Dare\u2019s death, he sympathised with the RCCG leader,\u201d Rebecca Akpan, a member of Assemblies of God, told our reporter.\n\nAccording to Emmanuel Oche, \u201cI\u2019m sensing enmity, acrimony and envy among these pastors against the late Joshua. These top pastors are mainly known in Nigeria while T.B Joshua brought foreigners Nigeria. So, some of them might have felt belittled and this might have made them to develop everlasting hatred for him.\u201d\n\nChidinma Ebuha believes that most of these pastors did not believe in T.B Joshua\u2019s miracles. Although I\u2019m not a believer of these miracles but, I really don\u2019t think they should ignore him in death because of this. If my enemy dies, I will still condole with the family. It goes to tell you how Nigerian pastors operate. There\u2019s so much hatred among them. God help us. The question is, would Jesus Christ had done the same?\u201d\n\nWhatever be the case, Nigerians are of the opinion that even though the cleric was denied membership by the leadership of CAN and PFN, individual pastors, who are members of both organisations, had the rights to condole with the grieving family and members of the Synagogue Church.\n\nRecall that Rev. Chris Okotie, the Shepherd Superintendent of the Household of God Church, on Tuesday morning shared a cryptic post on his Facebook page in which he referenced a certain \u201dwizard of Endor\u201d who assumed the title of \u201dEmmanuel\u201d.\n\nThe clergyman in his post said the wizard who assumed the title of Emmanuel had been consumed by divine indignation. This, to many, was a veiled reference to the death of the acclaimed Prophet.",

          "text": "A former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Akwa Ibom, Uwemedimo Nwoko (SAN) has said that his current travails with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) may not be unconnected with his role against the anti-graft agency probing the government of former Governor Godswill Akpabio.\n\nNwoko who was quizzed by the EFCC recently over his role in various financial transactions of both the former and current administrations in the state spoke on a live radio programme in Uyo yesterday\n\nThe former AG who praised the EFCC for being civil, respectful and professional throughout the five days period of interrogation however expressed suspicion that the claims made against him by the agency could just be cover for the intention of punishing him for being the first lawyer to challenge the right of a federal agency to probe the activities of a state government in a federal state.\n\n\u201cLet me say this. When I came into office, EFCC was harassing the former governor, His Excellency, Senator Godswill Akpabio and trying to probe into the activities of the state government in the past, (before Udom Emmanuel).\n\n\u201cSo as a constitutional lawyer, I demanded to know the basis the EFCC as a federal agency was drawing it\u2019s powers from to come and query the way the state government was spending money from, in a federal republic like Nigeria. And I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the answer they gave me so I went to court.\n\n\u201cWe filed the very first suit of that nature in the whole country. I filed that suit in February 2017 and we were doing that matter all along. So because of that matter, we got an injunction stopping the EFCC from interfering with the transactions of the Akwa Ibom State government. Not the transactions of the days of governor Udom Emmanuel, transactions that happened before he came into government.\n\n\u201cWhen we got the injunction, the EFCC wasn\u2019t happy with me because they said such a thing has not happened before in the country, that I\u2019m the only person that came to do it and I told them that I swore to uphold the constitution and what I\u2019m taking to court for interpretation is the same constitution I swore to uphold.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to do is to send your lawyers to court to come and argue that matter. If they win, they win, if I win, I win. So because of the injunction, they couldn\u2019t access Akwa Ibom State. They couldn\u2019t make any serious incursion into the state. I think that was one of the reasons they were waiting for me. So, I also knew that when I left the government, that they would come for me. That\u2019s why I said I was expecting them and kept all my records very straight.\u201d He explained.\n\nHe explained that the N65 million out of N1.3B transferred to his account by a former NBA chairman, Mr Paul Usoro(SAN) that the EFCC said was a kickback was meant to pay lawyers of Akwa Ibom State extraction which he was under obligation to coordinate as Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice adding that they were e-transfers and were verifiable.\n\n\u201cEFCC should have asked the circumstances under which Paul Usoro, SAN transferred 65 million naira to my account. As at the time 1.3 billion naira was paid to Paul Usoro, SAN, we were equally running 37 election tribunal matters, running four tribunals that were relocated from Uyo to Abuja.\n\n\u201cPaul Usoro was coordinating the entire legal team. Amongst the legal team were local lawyers, local lawyers in the sense of Akwa Ibom based lawyers and Paul Usoro was handling the Senior Advocates and the other lawyers from outside the state.\n\n\u201cHe mandated me as Attorney General to coordinate the home based lawyers. So the N65M was for the lawyers I coordinated. Good enough, it was not something that was hidden.\n\n\u201cThe statement of account which they already had in their file from Zenith Bank reflected that the money was transferred to my account on the 27th, August 2015, on the 28th, I started paying out the monies and good enough, they were all transfers, so they have it in their own record.\u201d He explained.\n\nNwoko dismissed the second allegation that he used funds from the Akwa Ibom State government through the Ministry of Justice to pay for the legal fees of Governor Emmanuel during the post election litigation challenging the victory of the PDP in the 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been because the legal fees of His Excellency, the governor, were paid totally from the party (PDP) coordinated arrangement. No one naira of Akwa Ibom State money was used to pay the legal bills of the governor. Not one naira and I told the EFCC that.\u201d The former AG said.\n\nHe added that he expected his arrest long before it came because, \u201cit was one of the things I expected. I expect that when I leave office, that I will be taken to anywhere in Nigeria, that I will be questioned, that I will be asked to make statements and clarifications\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been in the kind of office that I occupied, did the things I did, stepped on the toes I stepped on and you didn\u2019t anticipate that when you come out, that this kind of thing will happen. Possibly, it may not be the last time. Those things are expected\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I am ready for anything. If I\u2019m going to be charged to court, I\u2019ve made my statement. My belief is that when they read through my statement they need any further documents which are already available to them.\n\n\u201cThey have a team of lawyers to look at the documents and determine whether given what I have said, there is a valid case in court to pursue. If they don\u2019t have a case, they will also advise themselves properly.\u201d",
          "summary": "So because of that matter, we got an injunction stopping the EFCC from interfering with the transactions of the Akwa Ibom State government.\nNot the transactions of the days of governor Udom Emmanuel, transactions that happened before he came into government.\nIf they win, they win, if I win, I win.\nSo because of the injunction, they couldn\u2019t access Akwa Ibom State.\nNo one naira of Akwa Ibom State money was used to pay the legal bills of the governor.",

          "text": "The African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) has officially unveiled the \u201cCentre LSD Build Grant,\u201d to bridge the unacceptable gender imbalance in the extractive industry in the country.\n\nThe Centre said the Build Grant is for general support for strengthening an intersectional approach to gender and natural resources management, and a project for institutional strengthening.\n\nThe Programme Coordinator, Centre LSD, Ms. Victoria Udoh said this while unveiling the Grant in a press conference in Abuja.\n\nShe said that the Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives.\n\nShe added that the result of the above scenario is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\nMs. Victoria explained that the overarching goal of the project is to build strong and resilient organizations that will contribute to elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\nShe said that the project which is supported by Ford Foundation is divided into two fold, \u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions\u201d and \u201cProgrammatic Interventions\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions seeks to build the capacity of staff to deliver on the BUILD grant and beyond. It is also designed to strengthen the systems and structures of the Centre through the procurement of ancillary resources needed to interrogate systems, structures and practices that have put women and children in disadvantage in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile Programmatic Interventions is dedicated to the implementation of activities geared towards reducing the barriers faced by women in the extractive industry. During the project lifespan, activities and programmes to reverse the identified practices and barriers faced by women in the extractive sector will be our focus\u201d.\n\nGiving insight into factor that attracted the grant to the centre, Ms. Victoria said: \u201cIn Nigeria, women faces systematic discrimination in all phases of extractive industry. The entrenched gender bias not only prevents women from engaging in and accessing economic benefits, but also manifests in how companies and governments engage with communities at all stages of extractive activities. The Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives. The result is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\n\u201cThe African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) in sync with the government\u2019s determination to reform the extractive industry and diversify revenue sources to include non-oil revenue, implemented the strengthening civic engagement and advocacy for effective natural resource governance in Nigeria project. The aim was to mobilize citizens to participate in the governance of natural resources for the mineral sector to contribute significantly to the Gross Domestic Product. During the implementation of this project, emphasis was not placed on the humans as well the effect on men varies from effects on women and children. For example, as land is expropriated for extractive industry projects, so are family farms that women often manage. These farms give women the ability to earn income, some level of independence and decision making power in the household and community\u201d.\n\nTo address these anomalies, she concluded that the centre is implementing a grant, still in the extractive sector, specifically looking at how to integrate gender in its extractive work.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians have dragged the Federal Government to the ECOWAS court over the unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nIn the suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed on Tuesday before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, SERAP and the concerned Nigerians are seeking: \u201can order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nFollowing the deletion of a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed last week announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe government has also threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has asked all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter.\n\nIn the suit filed by Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana SAN, the Plaintiffs contend that \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part: \u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\n\n\u201cA lot of Nigerians at home and abroad rely on Twitter coverage of topical issues of public interest to access impartial, objective and critical information about ideas and views on how the Nigerian government is performing its constitutional and international human rights obligations.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the decline in freedom of expression in Nigeria is that the country is today ranked alongside countries hostile to human rights and media freedom such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Colombia.\n\nSERAP and the concerned Nigerians are therefore asking the ECOWAS Court of Justice for the following reliefs:\n\nA declaration that the action of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and microblogging application without an order of a competent court of jurisdiction is unlawful, inconsistent and incompatible with Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA declaration that the act of the Defendant in mandating its agent to commence and continue to regulate the social media in Nigeria amounts to restriction and censorship, thus violating Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA declaration that the act of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and microblogging application in Nigeria without any offence known to law is incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations, and are therefore null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\nA declaration that the directive by the Defendant, through the National Broadcasting Commission, directing and \u2018advising\u2019 broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and discontinue its use is a breach of the citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression, access to information as well as media freedom, and therefore, null and void.\n\nA declaration that the act of the defendant to frequently threaten Nigerians and other people who use Twitter and/or other social microblogging applications in Nigeria with criminal prosecution and the actual act of suspending the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, violates the principle that there is no punishment without law, and the right to fair hearing, and therefore, null and void.\n\nAn order setting aside the suspension, ban, sanction or other punishments whatsoever imposed on Twitter, Nigerians, media houses, broadcast stations and any social media service providers by the Defendant and its agents.\n\nAn order directing the Defendant and its agents to immediately revoke, withdraw and/or rescind their suspension or ban of Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s) in Nigeria in line with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Revised ECOWAS Treaty 1993.\n\nAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions and other punishment including criminal prosecution or doing anything whatsoever to harass Twitter, broadcast stations, Nigerians and other people and any social media service provider(s), and media houses who are Twitter users.\n\nSuch further orders the Honorable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this suit.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the interim application and the substantive suit.",

All we hear is that herdsmen and farmers are fighting and for that reason, 200 people are kidnapped.

Can anybody come and tell me one, two, three, four reasons why this APC should not win in the next election?\n\n\u201cAll I hear is that because of insecurity this, insecurity that. But you send people out in the night to go and cause trouble and use it in the day to blame the government,\u201d the governor said in reference to the high rate of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u2018I Alone Cannot Restore Security In Imo\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the crisis in Imo state, Governor Uzodinma called on fellow leaders to join hands to bring an end to the insecurity in the state, noting that himself alone cannot restore security.\n\nHe appealed to all stakeholders including traditional rulers, religious leaders, and politicians, to engage more with the issues in order to engender peace in the country.\n\nHe also stated that former political office holders who have failed to speak out against the security crisis in the country have questions to answer.\n\nAccording to him, if all leaders speak out condemning perpetrators of insecurity, a lot of changes would be visible.\n\n\u201cAnybody worth his onions as a leader should be able to speak out. How many of them are speaking out.\n\n\u201cHow many of them are condemning what is going on. rather what you see is leaders fanning the embers of insecurity, the governor said.\n\nHe also stated that anyone found culpable in the destruction of government property would be made to face the full wrath of the law.",

          "text": "A United Nations rights expert has warned of \u201cmass deaths from starvation, disease and exposure\u201d in eastern Myanmar after \u201cbrutal, indiscriminate attacks\u201d by the military forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes in Kayah State.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur for Myanmar, called for urgent international action, saying attacks by the military \u2013 which took power after a February coup \u2013 were \u201cthreatening the lives of many thousands of men, women and children\u201d in Kayah or Karenni state.\n\n\u201cLet me blunt,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cMass deaths from starvation, disease, and exposure, on a scale we have not yet seen since the February 1 coup, could occur in Kayah State absent immediate action.\u201d\n\nMass deaths from starvation, disease and exposure could occur in Kayah State after many of the 100,000 forced to flee into forests from junta bombs are now cut off from food, water and medicine by the junta. The international community must act.\n\n\u2014 UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews (@RapporteurUn) June 8, 2021\n\nThe plea came hours after the UN office in Myanmar said the violence in Kayah had displaced an estimated 100,000 people, who were now seeking safety in forests, host communities and southern parts of neighbouring Shan state.\n\nThose fleeing and those in locations affected by the bombing and artillery fire were in dire need of food, water, shelter, fuel and access to healthcare, the UN office said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis crisis could push people across international borders seeking safety,\u201d it warned, calling for all parties to \u201ctake the necessary measures and precautions to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure\u201d.\n\nThis picture taken on June 1, 2021 shows people taking refuge in a jungle area in Demoso, Kayah state, after they fled from fighting between the Myanmar military and members of the People\u2019s Defence Forces (PDF) [Stringer/ AFP]\n\nThis picture taken on June 3, 2021 shows people taking refuge in a jungle area in Demoso, Kayah state [Stringer/ AFP]\n\nMyanmar has been in chaos since the military takeover, with daily protests across the country and fighting in border areas between the military and armed ethnic minority groups. Human rights groups say security forces have killed at least 849 people since the coup and detained 5,800 others.\n\nPeople living in Kayah told Al Jazeera the military has launched indiscriminate air attacks and shelling in civilian areas after fighting broke out on May 21 between the security forces and a civilian resistance group calling itself the Karenni People\u2019s Defense Force (KPDF).\n\nThere have been several deaths, including that of a 14-year-old boy who was shot dead in Loikaw township and a young man who was shot in the head with his hands tied behind his back. The military has repeatedly attacked churches in the predominantly Christian area, in one instance killing four people who were among 300 villagers sheltering at a Catholic church in Loikaw.\n\nSecurity forces have also attacked and threatened humanitarian workers, while Andrews said he had received reports that soldiers were \u201cstopping aid from reaching these desperate people\u201d by setting up military blockades and laying landmines on public roads.\n\n\u201cAny pressure or leverage UN member states can put on the junta must now be exerted so that junta leader Min Aung Hlaing will immediately: (1): open access roads and allow lifesaving aid to reach those in need, and (2) stop terrorizing the population by ceasing the aerial bombardment, shelling, and shooting of civilians.\u201d\n\nAndrews said the military\u2019s attacks against civilians in Kayah was the \u201clatest in a series throughout Myanmar causing massive displacement and humanitarian suffering, including in Mutraw in Karen State, Mindat in Chin State, and Bago City, among other areas\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, the international community must cut off access to the resources the junta relies on to continue these brutal attacks against the people of Myanmar,\u201d he added.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s military has so far ignored international criticism of its violent crackdown and showed little sign of heeding a \u201cFive-Point Consensus\u201d agreed between Min Aung Hlaing and Southeast Asian leaders in April. The agreement \u2013 reached at a special summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \u2013 called for an end to violence, political talks and the naming of a regional special envoy.\n\nOn Monday, ASEAN foreign ministers met a Myanmar military envoy in China\u2019s Chongqing and expressed concern over the army\u2019s \u201cpainfully slow\u201d progress on implementing the consensus. Wunna Maung Lwin, the military\u2019s foreign minister, however, told the meeting: \u201cThe only way to ensure the democratic system that is disciplined and genuine\u201d was through a military drafted five-point programme announced in the wake of February\u2019s coup.\n\nThat plan has little similarities with the ASEAN consensus, and includes the establishment of a new elections commission \u2013 the military has claimed without evidence that the November 2020 election was fraudulent \u2013 measures against the COVID-19 pandemic as well as efforts for economic recovery.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has backed the ASEAN plan.\n\nIn a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang met Wunna Maung Lwin and called for the implementation of the \u201cFive-Point Consensus\u201d and an end to \u201call kinds of violence\u201d in Myanmar.\n\n\u201cWe encourage all parties in Myanmar to engage in political dialogue within the constitutional and legal framework and restart the process of democratic transformation,\u201d Wang said in the statement.",
