          "text": "No fewer than 723 cases have been managed at the case management centre for the Lassa fever disease.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the death toll from the disease has continued to rise as the country has so far reported 151 deaths.\n\nTwenty-three states have also reported confirmed cases of the disease.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control noted this on its website on Sunday\u2019s Lassa fever situation report.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that Lassa fever, an endemic disease in Nigeria, occurs throughout the year. Still, more cases are recorded during the dry season.\n\nSince the last outbreak of the disease in 2016, the NCDC noted that there had been an increase in the number of recurring cases.\n\nIn 2019, the centre noted that 796 cases were reported, while in 2020, 1,165 cases were confirmed during the height of the pandemic.\n\nThe NCDC also confirmed a total of 4,632 suspected cases in 2021.\n\nThe centre stated, \u201cSo far in 2022, 151 people have lost their lives; the highest deaths reported in four years.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, from week 1 to week 17 in 2022, 151 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate of 19.6%.\n\n\u201cIn total, for 2022, 23 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 95 local government areas. Of all confirmed cases, 68% are from states namely, Ondo (28 %), Edo (25%) and Bauchi (15%).\n\n\u201cThe predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (range:1 to 80 years, median age: 30 years). The number of suspected cases has increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2021.\u201d\n\nAlso, NCDC noted that while 51 health workers have been affected, 723 persons have been hospitalised.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe Federal Ministry of Environment is also implementing a Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high burden states.\n\n\u201cLassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria. Its symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, general body weakness, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pains, chest pain, and in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and other body areas.\n\n\u201cThe time between infection and appearance of symptoms of the disease ranges from three to twenty-one days. Early treatment and diagnosis increase the chances of survival.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, South-East zone, on Sunday, advised the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to borrow a leaf from former President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua and reconsider his hard stance on the incarceration of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThis is following the Buhari-led regime\u2019s insistence that it would allow the courts to decide Kanu\u2019s fate.\n\nBut speaking during a prayer rally in Enugu by the PFN, the National Vice Chairman, South-East of the Christian body, Bishop Maxwell Korie, said the stand of the Federal Government was not in anyone\u2019s interest.\n\nThe cleric, who expressed worry over the level of insecurity in the zone, said dialogue remained the solution to the problems.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned with the level of insecurity in the South-East zone and having reviewed the situation, we urge the Federal Government to invite the agitation groups to a dialogue table to negotiate their issues and misgivings.\n\n\u201cThe past administration of the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua used dialogue to solve the problems of the Niger Delta region. So, we advise the incumbent administration of Muhammadu Buhari to borrow a leaf from the Yar\u2019Adua administration.\n\n\u201cThis is the sure and fastest way towards resolving these issues.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the 2023 presidential election, he re-echoed the PFN stand that the body would vote against any political party that fielded a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nHe said, \u201cAny joint ticket of two Muslims in the office of the President and the Vice President in the forthcoming 2023 general elections shall not be tolerated. It is dead on arrival.\n\n\u201cAll the political parties should take note of this, especially the two major political parties, the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cAll PFN blocs have already been instructed to mobilise and vote against such a political party that fields two Muslims in the presidential election come 2023,\u201d he added.\n\nHe disclosed that the solemn Assembly and prayer rally was born out of God\u2019s vision to the National President of the PFN, Bishop Francis Wale Oke.\n\nHe stated that it is the church\u2019s responsibility of Jesus Christ to preserve Nigeria as one single entity and prevent it (Nigeria) from disaster and destruction.\n\nIn his remarks, the Enugu State Chairman of PFN, Bishop Godwin Madu, urged Christians to despair and remain prayerful and resolute.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Meanwhile, the banking sector closed flat.\n\nCommenting, analysts at Cordros Capital, a Lagos-based investment banking firm, said: \u201cIn the near term, we think the bears are likely to book profit across most counters given the five-week bullish run in the market. Thus, we see more of a \u201cchoppy theme\u201d as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the MPC meeting scheduled later in the month.\u201d",

When properly searched in the presence of the owners on Wednesday 11th May, 67,100 tablets/capsules of Tramadol and 12,650 ampules of pentazocine, morphine and dopamine were recovered.\n\n\u201cOn the same day, NDLEA operatives in Kaduna arrested a notorious drug dealer, Shehu Kabiru a.k.a Dan-Zaira, wanted by the Kastina Command of the Agency for jumping bail. Recovered from him include: 45,000 tablets of Diazepam weighing 41.5kg; 50,000 tablets of Exol, weighing 15.6kg; 1,500 tablets of Rohypnol weighing 700 grams and 300 bottles of codeine weighing 41.5kg.\n\n\u201cIn Yobe State, no fewer than 7,029 tablets of Tramadol, D5, and Exol as well as 1.5kg cannabis were recovered from a drug dealer, Ibrahim Yakubu, when his hideout was raided in Unguru town on Sunday 8th May, while in Rivers state, one Chekiri Richard Obomanu was arrested at Eleme area on Wednesday 11th May with 207.2kg cannabis.\n\n\u201cNo less than 19,600 tablets of Tramadol coming from Onitsha, Anambra state to Abuja were intercepted and recovered along Okene/Abuja highway on Wednesday 11th May by NDLEA operatives in Kogi State.\u201d\n\nAlso, over 3,539 suspects have been arrested and 65,916kg of assorted illicit drugs seized within the first quarter of this year, NDLEA chair Brig.-Gen Buba Marwa (rtd) said.\n\nMarwa was speaking at the Western Naval Command (WNC), Apapa, while receiving two Epenal boats donated to the agency by the Nigerian Navy (NN) to boost its drug war.\n\nRepresented by the Director, Seaport Operations of the NDLEA, Mrs. Omolade Faboyade, Marwa said the agency broke its first quarter operational record with the arrests which included that of a \u201crogue security personnel and a well-known billionaire baron.\n\nReiterating the agency\u2019s commitment to contain proliferation of drugs in the country, Marwa said security organisations can no longer afford to work in silos, adding that illicit drug trafficking, as a transnational organised crime, required the deployment of intelligence and close-knit with key stakeholders like the navy and other security organisations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn our effort to stem the ride of narcotic drugs, we have gone the extra mile and that includes the pursuit of synergy with organisations in the security sector.\n\n\u201cSo far, our efforts in one year showed that the strategy is effective. In 2022, we recorded the arrest of more than 12,300 suspected drug offenders, including seven drug barons with 1,400 traffickers jailed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were able to counsel and rehabilitate 8,000 drug users and in the same period, also, we mopped up over 3.4 million kilograms of assorted drugs. Interestingly, drugs and illicit proceeds of drug crime worth over N130 billion were successfully recovered.\u201d",

          "text": "Operatives attached to the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT) have arrested two herders, Abdulrahman Lolo, 20, and Mohammed Sanni, 26, over alleged kidnap of a man, Jibril Saidu, 35, in Kaduna State.\n\nThe suspects allegedly kidnapped their victim at Bandoko near Katari, along the Kaduna-Abuja Highway, Kachia Local Government Area on April 29.\n\nThey were said to have stormed the village around 11:30pm with the aim of kidnapping a woman who sells Fura, in order to rape her but changed their mind after meeting her husband at home whom they took captive.\n\nThe Nation gathered that the suspects had monitored the women before they eventually attacked that night and had planned to move her into the notorious Gbadoko forest where they would gang-rape her.\n\nHowever, when they broke into her home, they found the woman with her husband and went further to demand the key to his motorcycle, stripped, bound and blindfolded the man before taking him hostage.\n\nAccording to information, the suspects went away with the man and his motorcycle, adding that the man\u2019s mother raised the alarm as soon as they left his premises.\n\n\u201cThe mother of the husband raised the alarm and the residents came out but could not go after the invaders fearing that they may be armed.\n\n\u201cThe villagers immediately organised local vigilantes to secure the community and then sent a distress call to the IRT operatives attached to Operation Puff Adder for urgent action.\n\n\u201cWhen the police arrived, the villagers assisted in showing them directions and they chased after the kidnappers. Around 5am on April 30, the police officers were able to trace the invaders into their hideout at Gbadoko forest where the suspects on sighting the police officers, abandoned their victim and motorcycle and fled into the thick forest.\n\n\u201cThe police officers continue their chase after them and were able to arrest one of the kidnappers, Abdulrahman Lolo, a 20-year-old herder,\u201d said a source.\n\nFrom Lolo\u2019s interrogation and further investigations, operatives arrested Sanni, while efforts were on to apprehend other fleeing members of the gang.\n\nIn his confessional statement, Lolo said: \u201cI and one Abubarka Baya rear cows in the same village. Abubakar asked me to follow him to a Fulani ruga settlement in the same area. Our plan is to abduct a woman for the purpose of raping her, but it turned out to be kidnapping of her husband. \u201cWe only made use of torchlights, cutlasses and sticks, not gun. Others who went together with me for the operation are: Sani, Abubakar, Umar and Seif. All of us are boys of Alhaji Lolo of Gadam Mallam-Maman.\n\n\u201cThe other boys mentioned have been going out for operations before, but this is my own first time. The role I played was to mount road and pass information to other members who escaped when police chased us.\u201d\n\nCommending the police for rescuing him, the victim said the suspects had threatened to kill him if he failed to cooperate with them.\n\nJibril said: \u201cAn unidentified group of persons invaded my house, flashed torchlights in my eyes and I could not see. They threatened to kill me and my family if I do not cooperate with them. They ordered me to remove my cloths, and at the same time, requested for the key of my motorcycle, which I quickly surrendered to them.\n\n\u201cThey used my cloths to blindfold my eyes and tied my two hands to the back. They led me out of the house to my bike and drove me away. I thank the IRT men for rescuing me.\u201d\n\nConfirming the arrests police spokesman, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, said the Inspector-General of Police (IG) Alkali Usman, has directed the Commander of IRT, DCP Olatunji Disu, to ensure prompt prosecution of all cases and ensure peace returned to Abuja-Kaduna highway.\n\nAdejobi noted that, police officers were more effective when members of the public provide them useful and timely information.",

The mob later set his unconscious body on fire before help could come his way,\u201d said a source.\n\nHis murder has generated outcry on the social media with the #JusticeForDave currently trending.\n\nA colleague of the deceased said the incident occurred in front of a bar where they has gone to perform, adding that Imoh had gone to set up the instruments.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe called on the police to intervene, they showed up and even fired two shots in the air to disperse the mob. IT DIDNT WORK!!\n\n\u201cThey were only able to rescue two of our musicians who were already beaten to a pulp! Sadly, our sound engineer Dave became the casualty.\u201d\n\nOne Ope King who said the deceased was her brother-in-law, wrote: \u201cThis is my brother-in-law!

Lagos is no longer safe\u2026\n\nLagos Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, has ordered homicide detectives at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) to go after the remaining members of the mob.\n\nLagos Police spokesman (PPRO), SP Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed the killing said all the culprits have been arrested.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can authoritatively confirm that all the perpetrators of this heinous crime have been arrested. They will all be prosecuted. Say no to jungle justice!\n\n\u201cOne must not take laws into one\u2019s hand no matter the degree of provocation.

          "text": "Muslims who kill Christians in Nigeria over blasphemy will not smell Paradise, popular Kaduna-based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has declared.\n\nHe was reacting to the killing of a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education (SSCOE) Deborah Samuel over alleged blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad last Thursday.\n\nGumi stated categorically that Nigeria is not an Islamic state, adding that Muslims have agreement with people of other faiths to live together peacefully.\n\nHe said any Muslim who kills Christians with whom they have agreed to live peacefully on religious guise has committed a grievous sin.\n\nThe Islamic scholar spoke in one of his preaching\u2019s at Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna.\n\nHe said it is unfortunate some Muslim clerics were quoting verses they don\u2019t understand and telling people to kill whoever insults their religion.\n\nQuoting some Quranic verses and jurisprudence, the cleric said killing a non-Muslim under the guise the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad is not an excuse \u201cbecause Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\u201d\n\nGumi said some Muslims in Nigeria that want to defend Prophet Muhammad should be ashamed of themselves because they are corrupt.\n\nHe explained the best way to defend the Prophet is to follow his teachings.\n\nAccording to Gumi: \u201cWe the clerics need to wake up and teach the Muslims their religion. We must leave this state of ignorance, we have turned like animals. We the Muslims are not the only ones in this country.\n\n\u201cIt is not only that we are not the only ones in this country, we must know that there was nothing the unbelievers did not do to Prophet Muhammad but he was patient because he was conscious that if he killed them, the unbelievers he was trying to bring to the fold of Islam will tag him a killer.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are neither Muslims not Christians in Nigeria and everyone is trying to win their souls. Also, there people who are not Muslims, whom we are preaching Islam to so that they can enter the fold of Islam and be salvage in the hereafter.\n\n\u201cIf we now begin to kill people, they will say it is even from the leader of our faith, Prophet Muhammad that we have learnt it. They will say their religion is a religion of bloodletting. At a time we are trying to draw attention of people to see the beauty of Islam, we are now scaring them away.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we even see some clerics who are telling people that whoever insults your religion just kill then. They are quoting verses they don\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201d There is no one who has the will to kill anyone except through the Islamic justice system. And in doing this, the conditions of such justice must be completed before anyone can be killed.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur religion is a civilised religion. The white people Learnt rule of law from Islam. But today we are the ones in this level of lack of civilisation, to the extent that an Islamic cleric is quoting Qur\u2019an and Hadith spreading and encouraging barbarism.\n\n\u201cPeople that have not been able to perfect their own acts of worship the way they are supposed to. People who don\u2019t know how to pray properly are now the ones that say they want to dispense justice to people who commit blasphemy.\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that, in the Islamic perspective, the world is divided into two, the Islamic world and the non-Islamic world, that is countries that are governed by the Islamic law and those that are governed by other laws.\n\n\u201cThose who are not Muslims are divided into two; there are non-Muslims that you engage in war and there non-Muslims that you have agreement with. Those you have agreement with are also divided into two; those who are living under the Islamic laws and those that are not binded by the Islamic laws.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s non-Muslims are not living under the Islamic laws, we all have an agreement under the Nigerian Constitution to live together. So, Prophet Muhammad said whoever kills a soul of non-Muslim that is under such agreement of living together will not smell the fragrance of paradise. Such person\u2019s distance to paradise will be like a journey of 40 years.\n\n\u201cKilling a non-Muslims under the guise that, the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad is not an excuse because Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\n\n\u201cWhat Allah asked us to do in the face of blasphemy in a society like ours, is to be patient and preach to the people and make them understand our religion. In our kind of society, we don\u2019t have the right to kill for blasphemy, otherwise, even many people who call themselves Islamic clerics who have equally been killed because they have fallen into blasphemy by calling Allah human being or saying they know tomorrow or those who have indirectly turned to Babalawo.\n\n\u201cThe Prophet told us that, a time will come towards the end time, when people will feeling like taking other people\u2019s life. So, he said instead of doing that, it is better for you to look for a rock and be boxing it, so that, you don\u2019t the urge of killing anytime.\n\n\u201cSo, who do we leave just justice for in the face of blasphemy? It is the authority. We don\u2019t have the right to take up arms and kill anyone, except in self defence, like when some comes for your life or an armed robber invades your house. You are not the one to defend Islam, in fact, you are making the work of those calling people into Islam difficult.\n\n\u201cThe right thing the students who killed the lady in Sokoto ought to do is to report her to the school management, then the management reports to the Governor or Sultan for them to know how to stop her. Just by hearing her commit blasphemy, you just went and carried out jungle justice on her, who taught you that? What do you want our country to turn into? We must leave these acts of barbarism.\n\n\u201cIs it even we the Muslims of Nigeria that want to defend Prophet Muhammad? We that are corrupt? We that cannot even be differentiated from unbelievers in corrupts acts. The best way to go if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his examples by being upright in all fronts.\u201d",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHer comment triggered sharp reactions as someone volunteered the lady\u2019s location and house with a warning to get her. The threat by some people to give her Deborah treatment made security agents to evacuate her and her family late Saturday. Security agencies were subsequently placed on red alert as the police and other sister agencies were seen patrolling the streets of Maiduguri to nip any uprising in the bud.\n\nMeanwhile, outrage and condemnation have continued to trail the lynching of Deborah. While the Northern Governors Forum condemned the act of self-help as exhibited by the mob saying it could threaten law, order, general peace and security of the society, popular Kaduna-based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, told those that participated in the act that they would not make paradise.\n\nAlso, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) from 19 Northern states and Abuja, conglomerates of Fellowship of Churches of Christ in Nigeria, known as Tarayyar Ekklesiyoyin Kristi a Nijeria (TEKAN), Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria, and Are Onakankafo of Yorubaland, Otunba Gani Adams, yesterday, joined in condemning Deborah\u2019s killing, describing it as an evil act.This is as the Sokoto State Government announced the suspension of the resumption of basic and secondary schools in the state by one week. The schools were initially scheduled to resume yesterday and today for boarding and day students. Also, corps members serving, especially those in the Sokoto metropolis, have been advised to remain at home due to the 24-hour curfew. This was contained in another statement from the spokesperson of the scheme in Sokoto State, Malam Sani Idris.\n\nChairman, Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong in a statement said the governors were concerned about the development which is clearly an extra-judicial measure of addressing perceived infraction.\n\nLalong said any attempt to adopt self-help in addressing grievances whether religious or otherwise, would only lead to further chaos that could threaten law, order, general peace and security of the society.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nWhile commiserating with the family of the victim, Lalong said Northern governors want security agencies to be allowed to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure that the law took its full course on anyone found wanting.\n\nThe governors also appealed for calm following reports of the hijack of a peaceful protest which later turned violent and led to the imposition of a curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSheikh Gumi, in one of his preachings at Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna, said any Muslim who kills a Christian in Nigeria because the prophet was allegedly insulted would not smell paradise.\n\nHe said Nigeria was not an Islamic State and that Muslims in the country have agreement with people of other faiths to live together peacefully and that anyone who kills them on religious guise has committed a grievous sin.\n\nThe Islamic scholar said it was unfortunate that some Muslim clerics were quoting verses they do not understand and telling people to kill whoever insults their religion.\n\nQuoting some Quranic verses and jurisprudence, the cleric said Killing a non-Muslim under the guise that the person uttered a blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad is not an excuse, \u201cbecause Allah has told us in the Qur\u2019an that the non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now that the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce.\u201d\n\nGumi said some Muslims of Nigeria that want to defend Prophet Muhammad should be ashamed of themselves because they are corrupt, adding that the best way to go if we want to defend the Prophet is to follow his teachings.\n\nRegardless, CAN from 19 Northern states and Abuja have demanded that all christian leaders terminate their participation in Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), until their counterparts in Islamic faith show commitment to tame their followers on equal terms.\n\nIts spokesperson, Jechonia Gilbert, in a statement condemned what it termed gruesome and barbaric murder of Deborah Samuel by some religious extremists. The organisation said Nigeria is a country governed by the rule of law and order, hence any act of lawlessness and criminality must not be swept under the carpet. It also discouraged Christian parents across the nation especially, Northern states from sending their children to any school in Sokoto State, pending when the federal and state governments would be willing to secure the lives of students both in Sokoto and other states that are hostile to Christians and Christianity.\n\nCAN also called on the Federal and Sokoto State government not to resort to usual rhetorics but demonstrate political will and capacity to bring the perpetrators of the criminality to justice, otherwise, others may take queue from it and turn Nigeria to a country of lawlessness at every slightest provocation.\n\n\u201cWhile CAN does not and will not encourage casting aspersions on any religion or religious leader of any faith, it frowns at hiding under the gab of any religious extremism to perpetrate any form of criminality against its members especially in Northern Nigeria. God Almighty is not and can never be a weak God for mere mortal to fight and defend Him. On the contrary, it is He who keeps, watches and defends us. CAN believe that life is sacred and must never be taken by another unless as directed by the State. We appeal and counsel those who feel and think that killing and oppressing Christians is a demonstration of their service to their God to learn from history. Those that tried it in Egypt and their experiences should be enough warning. There is a Red Sea awaiting them, even those who are secretly encouraging them, must partake in the Red Sea experience,\u201d CAN warned.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe was received by a crowd of supporters at the airport and on the streets, APC chieftains and senior state government officials, led by Secretary to the State Government, Abdulkadir Adamu, who represented Governor Badaru Abubakar who was out of the state.\n\nAt a town hall meeting with delegates, the vice president restated his view that decisions about the 2023 elections should be based on what should be the best for the country.\n\n\u201cWe should make a decision based on the future of our children; we can make progress; we can move on. All I ask you to do is what is in the best interest of Nigeria; vote in the interest of our children.\u201d\n\nHe also restated how his training and experience in governance serving as deputy under President Muhammadu Buhari would help him to lead the country effectively as president.\n\nMohammed, who was in Anambra, Ebonyi and Enugu, at the weekend, said the South East and North East have the most legitimate claim to the presidency as both zones were yet to produce a president. Nevertheless, he pledged to support who ever emerges as candidate so as to ensure the opposition party wrests power from the APC.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAddressing delegates in Anambra, he noted that if elected, he would offer visionary leadership and tackle the myriad of problems confronting the country. He told Ebonyi and Enugu delegates that he would run an all-inclusive government and implored them to support him to clinch the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nIn a related development, Saraki said if elected, he would deploy technology to combat security challenges facing the country and put an end to it.\n\nResponding to questions from newsmen after a meeting with delegates in Kogi State, he said he has the solutions to all the problems confronting the nation.\n\nAccording to him, since the beginning of the current democratic settings in 1999, the North Central zone has not been given any opportunity to clinch the presidency, adding that the time is now ripe.He also said if elected, he would give equal opportunities to all irrespective of tribe and religion to attain the peak in their chosen careers.\n\nA\u2019Ibom gov denies blocking Atiku from seeing delegates\n\nGovernor Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom State and PDP presidential candidate, has denied plans to shield Akwa Ibom delegates from Abubakar Atiku, describing the rumour as the handiwork of mischief-makers trying to divert attention.\n\nA statement by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Ini Ememobong, described the alleged plot as spurious allegations, laced with foul and profane language.\n\n\u201cNothing can be farther from the truth as this. The said news is totally incompatible with the known accommodating disposition of Governor Emmanuel.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the governor, who has been in communication and contact with all other presidential aspirants (Atiku inclusive) was informed the former vice president will be visiting today to meet with delegates and thereafter see him (Governor Emmanuel) by 4pm, a proposal that was unhesitatingly accepted. It is, therefore, pure mischief for anyone to insinuate that the governor is preventing Atiku from seeing delegates. Other presidential aspirants have visited the party in Akwa Ibom without a hitch, so why would Atiku\u2019s be different?\n\n\u201cIn the light of current circumstances surrounding Atiku\u2019s media posture, especially online, we will like to discard the news item as not coming from him or his media handlers.We also want to believe this spurious statement does not have the authorisation of the presidential aspirant himself, especially since the allegation is not personally signed off and is not posted on any of his verified social media accounts. We urge the public to discountenance the fake news and treat it as an act of mischief of the highest order.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cOur delegates and team are waiting to receive the aspirant on the agreed date and time,\u201d he said.\n\nSpokesperson for the Udom Emmanuel Presidential Campaign Council, Bola Bolawole, said Governor Emmanuel is noted as an apostle of politics without bitterness.\n\nSenate: APC clears Nwaoboshi, Dafinone, Onowakpor\n\nAPC senatorial screening committee, yesterday, screened three senatorial aspirants from Delta State.\n\nThey include Peter Nwaoboshi, incumbent senator representing Delta North, former chairman of the state board of internal revenue, Joel-Onowakpo (Delta South); and Ede Dafinone (Delta Central.)\n\nSpeaking after his screening, Onowakpo said the screening has cleared way for him to face other contenders if any, adding that with God on his side, his supporters and the implicit confidence the party leadership has in him, he was confident the journey to the red chambers has been shortened.\n\nHe insisted that the APC was prepared more than ever before to take over Delta State in 2023. He said the ongoing exodus from the PDP to APC is enough evidence to the fact that the people of the state have embraced the APC because of the calibre of men presently piloting the affairs of the party in the state.\n\n\u2026 Onolemenme solicits delegates\u2019 votes, promises to transform Esanland\n\nA contender for the Edo Central senatorial seat, Mike Onolemenme, has solicited PDP delegates votes with a promise to transform Esanland from a largely rural place to an urban setting if voted to win the party ticket.\n\nThe former minister of works made the plea to individual delegates via a voice note he sent to all delegates of the senatorial district.\n\n\u201cI am personally soliciting your votes in the upcoming primary that will take place on Saturday, May 21, 2022\u201d, he said, adding that so much is at stake for the senatorial district.\n\nHe, therefore, said the delegates must get it right for Esan people.\n\n\u201cI am banking on you to win the primary. There is so much at stake. And we must get it right for Esan people. Engage and talk to other delegates you know to vote for me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe believed he can win the primary with votes from the delegates and go on to win the general election.\n\n\u201cIt is an important election that has the potential to transform Esan land from rural enclave to urban area with enhanced standards of living.\n\n\u201cSince an election can be won by a single vote, your votes matter, I assure you, you will not regret supporting me and your votes will be a step forward to making Esan land a better place,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\n\n*CAN calls for nationwide protests May 22\n\n*Kukah suspends Catholic masses, says residence not attacked\n\n*El-Rufai bans religious protest in Kaduna\n\n*Tears as Deborah is laid to rest in Niger\n\n\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos, Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nIn a move to avert major religious riots over the killing of a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, Miss Deborah Samuel, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, yesterday, declared a 24-hour curfew in Sokoto metropolis.\n\n\n\nDeborah was killed last Thursday by some fanatical students of the school over an allegation of blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in a WhatsApp post.\n\nThe curfew came as the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan-Kukah, has also suspended all masses in the Sokoto metropolis, but clarified that his residence was not attacked.\n\nMeanwhile, the remains of Deborah were also yesterday laid to rest in her home town, Tunga Magajiya, in the Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\n\n\nFollowing the protests in Sokoto, Governor Nasir-el-Rufai of Kaduna State has banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\nBut the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called on all its members to embark on a peaceful protest nationwide on May 22, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe declaration of the curfew in Sokoto followed the protests that greeted the condemnation of the killing by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III.\n\nDespite the tension that followed the condemnation by the Sultan, more condemnations have, however, greeted the despicable act.\n\n\n\nThe Sultan had on Friday condemned the killing of Deborah and charged the security agents to bring the perpetrators of the dastardly act to book.\n\nThis was said to have angered the extremists, who mobilised in the early hours of yesterday to the Sultan\u2019s palace in Sokoto.\n\n\n\nThe irate youths, who described Sultan\u2019s comment as anti-Islam, demanded that those arrested over the killing should be released with immediate effect.\n\nPalpable fear enveloped the Sokoto metropolis as the protesters, in their hundreds, trooped to the streets to express their displeasure over the detention of the two suspects arrested by the police over the killing of Deborah.\n\nMajor streets such as Ahmadu Bello Way, Kano Road, where banks are located, and Emir Yahaya Road, were deserted with business places and shops closed.\n\n\n\nHowever, an attempt by the protesters to attack the Palace of the Sultan was resisted by security agents.\n\nBut despite the heavy presence of security personnel in some strategic areas within the state capital, the protesters stormed Ahmadu Bello Way church line, where Catholic, Anglican, Baptist, ECWA, and Cherubim &Seraphim churches are located.\n\n\n\nThe protesters set a car ablaze around St. Mary Catholic Church and destroyed properties in the church.\n\nTo avert major religious riots, Tambuwal therefore declared a 24-hour curfew within the metropolis.\n\nIn a state-wide broadcast, the governor stated that as the Chief Security Officer of the state, he relied on the power conferred on him by sections 176 (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Sections 1 and 4 of the Public Order Act, as well as Section 15 of Sokoto State Peace Preservation Law, to impose a curfew within the Sokoto metropolis for the next 24 hours.\n\n\n\nHe appealed to the people of the state to continue to obey law and order.\n\n\u201cEveryone should, please, in the interest of peace go back home and observe these measures, for the re-establishment of peace, law, and order in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the remains of Deborah were yesterday been laid to rest in her hometown, Tunga Magajiya, in the Rijau Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\n\n\nTears flowed freely as she was being buried around 6:30 pm at the Christian cemetery in Tunga Magaiya.\n\nTunga Magaiya youths had insisted that Sokoto State Government should have been responsible for her burial.\n\nHer uncle, who is the Pastor of ECWA in Tunga Magajiya, Emmanuel Maaji, led the prayers at the cemetery.\n\nKukah Suspends Catholic Masses\n\nAlso, as part of measures to save the Catholic Church from further attacks, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Hassan-Kukah, has suspended all masses in the Sokoto metropolis.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the Director of Social Communications of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Rev. Fr. Christopher Omotosho.\n\n\n\nOmotosho noted that Kukah\u2019s residence was not attacked though rampaging hoodlums vandalised and torched two of the parishes presided over by the fiery preacher during the protests embarked upon by the Muslim youths.\n\n\u201cDuring the protest, groups of youths led by some adults in the background attacked the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral at Bello Way, destroying church glass windows, those of the Bishop Lawton Secretariat were also attacked and a community bus parked within the premises vandalised.\n\n\n\n\u201cSt. Kevin\u2019s Catholic Church Gidan Dere, Eastern By-pass, was also attacked and partly burnt; windows of the new hospital complex under construction, on the same premises, were shattered.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were promptly dispersed by a team of Mobile policemen before they could do further damage.\n\n\u201cThe hoodlums also attacked the Bakhita Centre located along Aliyu Jodi Road and burnt down a bus within the premises.\u201d\n\nKukah commended Tambuwal \u201cfor acting promptly by declaring the 24-hour curfew to stem the protests\u201d.\n\nHe also commended the security forces for promptly rising to the occasion to prevent further damage to the church\u2019s facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Bishop said no life was lost in the attacks and noted, \u201cContrary to information in circulation, we wish to disclaim that there was an attack of any sort on the residence of Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah.\n\nKukah appealed to Christians to remain law-abiding and pray for the return of normalcy.\n\n\u201cAll Masses in Sokoto metropolis have been suspended until the curfew is lifted,\u201d the statement added.\n\nCAN Calls for Nationwide Protests May 22\n\nMeanwhile, CAN has called on all its members to embark on a peaceful protest nationwide.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the General Secretary of CAN, Joseph Daramola, the President of the religious body, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, directed all secretariats to stage the protest on Saturday, May 22, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have been directed by the CAN President, His Eminence, Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo A. Ayokunle, to request all Church leaders, through your various Churches to organise a peaceful protest in honour of one of our daughters, Deborah Yakubu, who was gruesomely murdered on Thursday, May 12, 2022, at the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto in Sokoto State by some Islamic extremists.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe protest will take place on May 22, 2022, in the afternoon by 3p.m. in every Secretariat of the Christian Association of Nigeria nationwide and not on the streets to avoid further loss of lives,\u201d Daramola explained.\n\nIn a related development, Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna State has also banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, announced the ban in a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna.\n\n\n\nHe said the ban became imperative \u201cgiven moves by some unpatriotic elements to organise series of for-and-against protests related to a security development in one of the northern Nigerian states.\u201d\n\nHe urged citizens of the state to remain calm as they go about their lawful pursuits and to immediately report any such activity or security concern to the security agencies.\n\nMore Condemnations Trail Killing of Deborah\n\nMeanwhile, more condemnations have continued to trail the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn its reaction to the gruesome murder, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) expressed outrage over the killing and called on Tambuwal and President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure justice.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by ECWA President, Dr Stephen Baba Panya, the church stated that \u201cthe brutal killing and burning of Deborah by some misguided Muslim students is nothing short of overt criminality which we at the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) roundly condemn.\u201d\n\n\n\nPanya queried the legitimacy of a government that cannot guarantee the security of its citizens, saying: \u201cWhile our faith in this country is still very strong because we know that there are laws that ought to govern the conduct of all citizens like it is in every civilised clime, we are at a loss which provision under our nation\u2019s jurisprudence permits the brutal, senseless and shameful killing and setting ablaze of a fellow Nigerian by any misguided group, under whatever pretext with no one held accountable.\u201d\n\n\n\nECWA called on Buhari to prevail on the Inspector General of Police and all relevant law enforcement agencies \u201cto ensure that all the perpetrators of this dastardly and despicable act are not only fished out, but that they are brought to justice according to law.\u201d\n\n\n\nA former President of the Senate, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has also condemned in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a statement he signed, Anyim who is a presidential aspirant on the platform of the PDP, described the killing as cruel, illegal, callous, and inhuman.\n\nNYSC Urges Corps Members Not to Panic\n\nMeanwhile, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Sokoto State has enjoined the corps members serving in the state not to panic as their safety is guaranteed.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday, the state Coordinator of NYSC, Alhaji Muhammad Nakamba, urged the corps members to be law-abiding and remain indoors as announced by the government, especially those within the Sokoto metropolis.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the management of the scheme in the state had contacted all the security agencies to ensure the safety of its corps members throughout the curfew period and beyond.\n\nNBA Rejects Calls to Cancel Sokoto Conference\n\nIn another development, the Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Dr. Monday Ubani, has rejected the call by some lawyers to cancel the conference of the NBA-SPIDEL scheduled in Sokoto to protest the killing.\n\n\n\nUbani advised lawyers to be circumspect over the incident.\n\nHe maintained that it was preposterous for lawyers to call for the cancellation of the 2022 NBA-SPIDEL Conference in protest against the killing of Deborah, which was carried out by lawbreakers in the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe barbaric act was not authorised or approved by the state government to our knowledge. The state government has issued a statement condemning the act and requested that the crime perpetrators be brought to book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving said that, it will be preposterous for someone who is a lawyer to be suggesting that we should cancel our conference that is billed to take place in Sokoto because of the acts of lawbreakers in the state,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said he had sent a message to Tambuwal and the Attorney General of Sokoto, requesting a statement that the safety of the lawyers would be guaranteed.\n\n\n\nUbani argued that calling for the cancellation of the Sokoto conference was like asking for conferences billed for Owerri to be cancelled because of the killings of two army personnel \u2013 husband and wife \u2013 by unknown gunmen or asking for the cancellation of conferences in Abuja because of some of the killings that had taken place there recently.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Before Another Deborah is Lynched",
          "text": "SIMONKOLAWOLE! BY SIMON KOLAWOLE\n\nThe stoning to death of Deborah Samuel, a student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, over alleged blasphemy is a timely reminder that retail religious extremism is very much alive and kicking in northern Nigeria. It has been quite a while since killings over \u201cblasphemy\u201d took place in the north and the tendency is to think we have overcome this impulsive, irreversible reaction to a perceived religious offence. We are certainly not yet out of the woods. Deborah\u2019s killing, which I learnt was recorded on video and shared on social media, shocked many young Nigerians who were likely seeing such a gory incident on our shores for the first time in their lives.\n\nPerhaps the most unforgettable case took place in Kano in December 1994. Gideon Akaluka, a trader, was accused of \u201cdesecrating the Qur\u2019an\u201d and beheaded. His head was mounted on a stick and paraded on the streets of Kano like a trophy. We heard that Gen Sani Abacha, then-head of state and himself a Muslim, was so furious he did not subject the suspects to a formal trial before executing them. In the end, the sheet of paper that Akaluka \u201cdesecrated\u201d was apparently the leaflet instructions of a medication, written in English and Arabic. There are people who still don\u2019t know that Arabic is a language and not a religion \u2014 and that there is an Arabic Bible for Arab Christians.\n\nAnother religion-fuelled lynching that I can immediately recall happened in March 2007. The victim was Mrs Christianah Oluwaseesin, a secondary school teacher in Gandu, Gombe state. She was supervising an Islamic Religious Studies exam. According to what we were told, a student wanted to take her bag into the hall. The teacher seized and threw it outside, and the student screamed that it contained a Qur\u2019an. The mother-of-two was subsequently lynched \u201cfor desecrating and mutilating the Qur\u2019an\u201d. The principal, a Muslim, who tried to save her was battered while three classroom blocks, the school clinic and the library were burnt. Suspects were arrested and that was it.\n\nFor a while, there seems to be a pause in Muslim/Christian hostilities in the north \u2014 save for the intractable crisis in southern Kaduna, which dates back to at least 1987, and the Plateau killings that exploded in 2001 and keep exploding till today. The general lull, in my opinion, is not because anything has changed in the animosity but possibly because there is a bigger enemy at the door: Boko Haram. Since the group launched into full-scale terrorism in 2009, it has been taking victims from both religions. Contrary to what you read on social media, Boko Haram has evidently killed more Muslims than Christians and was at a time targeting mosques in Kano, Yobe and Borno states.\n\nSurely, before the Boko Haram era, religious killings were common in the north but it was usually as a result of confrontations between Christians and Muslims. With Boko Haram becoming a common threat, the confrontations reduced. The sense flowing from this is that by the time the Boko Haram era is subdued or exterminated, normal hostilities between Christians and Muslims may resume. It appears to be a conflict without end, always on ice and waiting for the opportunity to rupture. There are many reasons responsible for this perpetual state of hostilities and I would think that a country that has responsible leadership will work day and night to manage this animosity with dexterity.\n\nWill this enmity end anytime soon? The Sokoto incident is not an encouraging signal. If students of a higher institution \u2014 where teachers are being trained \u2014 can take law into their hands in this manner, lynching and burning the body of a fellow student, it only offers more than a passing glance at the future. The factory for the production of Boko Haram and ISIS militants is very much in full production. We typically think these terrorists recruit street urchins, but the conduct of the tertiary school students in Sokoto shows clearly that the pool of talents, as it were, is larger than the uneducated and unemployed youths out there. Boko Haram would have their eyes on them.\n\nBefore I proceed, I need to make something very clear: I do not support insulting people\u2019s religious sensibilities in the name of \u201cfree speech\u201d \u2014 although I must emphasise here that nothing on earth can justify jungle justice. Deborah\u2019s killing remains outrageous and stands condemned. But every freedom comes with responsibility. For some people, religion provides the highest form of emotions and any attack on their beliefs will trigger the worst in them. It is important that we understand our differences and respect the boundaries. It is, however, also very important to respond to offences within the limits of the law. Even if somebody kills your mother, there is a process to seek justice.\n\nMeanwhile, I want to commend all the Muslims and Muslim groups who have been courageous enough to condemn the killing of Deborah. It is a hard thing to do because they too can be attacked by the extremists. Every Muslim is hurt when the Prophet is insulted, but everyone doesn\u2019t react the same way. You can be angry and still restrain yourself from taking an irreversible action. Many Muslims have been sending messages to me quoting verses in the Qur\u2019an that condemn jungle justice. In an Islamic society, if someone is accused of blasphemy, there is a laid-down process to deal with it. This is to avoid miscarriage of justice. The extremists, however, always act differently.\n\nI have read some comments on social media that show how ignorant many people are about the ethnic and religious make-up of Nigeria. Some are using this opportunity to call for \u201crestructuring\u201d. But Deborah was a Christian from Kebbi state, not Ondo or Rivers. Will \u201crestructuring\u201d relocate Zuru Christians from Kebbi to Anambra? Some are asking what Christians \u201care still doing in the north\u201d, perhaps unaware that there are indigenous Christians in every northern state. Many attacked Lord Lugard yet again for the amalgamation of 1914. But was it Lugard that created northern Christians? I am not against people playing politics but a little dose of logical reasoning will not kill anybody.\n\nHaving said that, however, I admit that our society has been shaped for ages to think and act in a particular way and this cannot change overnight. We need to work on it. In the north, religion is a major marker of identity. People identify themselves first by their religion before their ethnicities. This should put in perspective the unending conflicts and tensions along religious lines. (This is what some people are trying to introduce to Yorubaland, egged on by busybodies. As I warned in a previous write-up, it never ends well and I hope Yoruba people will not take the bait.) Ethnic groups in the north are dominated by a religion. Hence, ethnic conflicts inevitably appear to be religious.\n\nHow do we prevent more Deborah cases? The starting point is for religious leaders across the divides to continue to preach the message of mutual respect and tolerance. The message of disrespect and jungle justice has to stop. The message of peace and love must become pervasive. Christians and Muslims must commit to respecting each other\u2019s beliefs. We need to be sensitive to what others hold dear and also know how to react with civility when we are offended. I have Catholic buddies whose beliefs about the Virgin Mary I do not share, but I am sensible enough not to go there. They may not lynch me because Christians take these things differently, but they will still be offended.\n\nTwo, government has to work with religious leaders and experts in conflict management to develop a system that will promote peace and pre-empt conflicts. There should be an alert procedure when tensions arise to prevent people from taking the law into their hands. There is no jurisprudence in the world that does not allow for fair hearing. In fact, Islamic jurisprudence allows for fair hearing, contrary to what the extremists want us to believe. Also, there should be an improved early-warning mechanism to flag potential confrontations and violence. Tensions can be nipped in the bud before things get out of hand. Interfaith dialogues must also be strengthened for better co-operation.\n\nThree \u2014 and this is a long-term project \u2014 cross-religious education is very critical to dealing with our mindsets. I think the education ministry recently tried to introduce it but it was shot down because of the fear of \u201cIslamisation\u201d. It is tragic that in many parts of the north today, all a Christian student knows about Islam is what fellow Christians teach them and all a Muslim knows about Christianity is as taught by fellow Muslims. What they are taught is left to the imagination. People grow up with resentment, hate and disdain towards each other. Being a friend to someone of a different religion is taught as \u201ccontamination\u201d \u2014 punishable by hellfire. This is full of dangers.\n\nFinally, there must be consequences for jungle justice. Nobody should ever get away with taking the law into their hands \u2014 whether over religion or something else. It is most unfortunate that violence broke out in Sokoto on Saturday with people taking to the streets to demand the release of suspects. This is impunity. It is annoying. In a state ravaged by under-reported killings by bandits, where lies their priority? Truly, the government has a long way to go. A peace-building project is complicated and will take sincere and thinking leadership to deliver. The killing of Deborah was not just because of the WhatsApp message. That was just a trigger. This jungle justice mindset needs overhauling.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTHUMBS UP!\n\nWith President Muhammadu Buhari failing to do the needful when his ministers started campaigning all over the country without resigning, one rare Nigerian stood out. His name is Dr Chukwuemeka Uwaezuoke Nwajiuba, a 54-year-old lawyer from Imo state who is seeking APC\u2019s presidential ticket. He did the honourable thing by resigning. No desperation to hold on to his job. This most likely influenced Buhari\u2019s belated decision to ask his politicking ministers to resign. Nwajiuba, a founding member of APP/ANPP, was elected into the house of reps in 1999 aged 32. He unsuccessfully contested for Imo governorship in 2003, 2007 and 2011. He is a rare Nigerian politician. Exemplary.\n\nBIRD IN HAND\n\nDr Chris Ngige, the (former) minister of labour and productivity, dramatically pulled out of the presidential race on Friday by opting to return to the cabinet \u2014 after attending a valedictory session presided over by President Buhari. We seem to understand why he pulled out \u2014 a bird in hand, as our forefathers would say, is worth two in the bush. But he tried to mask the entire drama around the withdrawal of his resignation as being in the \u201coverall interest of the nation\u201d. Come on! How can serving 12 more months as minister be of more \u201cnational interest\u201d than being president for a possible eight years? As they say on Naija Twitter, we play too much in this country. Hilarious.\n\nFREE ZONE\n\nThe PDP has finally ditched power rotation, obviously based on its calculations on how to reclaim power from the APC. I foresee its northern presidential hopefuls eventually agreeing to queue up behind one of their own to ward off the challenge from Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state and Mr Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra state. The potential biggest loser would be the south-east which has always voted for the PDP in presidential elections since 1999 and desires to finally produce an Igbo president. PDP\u2019s new disposition is all the more intriguing because it was the party that \u201ccreated\u201d power rotation. Compliance, or lack of it, has done much damage since 2010. Politics!\n\nDANGER AHEAD\n\nOn Monday, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) decided to extend its strike by three months. That is almost a whole semester, if I am not mistaken. There has been no love lost between ASUU and the government since this year\u2019s strikes started on February 14. Our children in public universities are going to lose a whole academic year again. I remember my younger sister spending six years on a four-year course in the 1990s because of long ASUU strikes.

          "text": "By Chu Maoming\n\nSome Nigerian friends have recently expressed concerns about China\u2019s COVID situation and showed their support to China\u2019s efforts to fight the disease. I truly appreciate the precious and valuable support at the difficult time. It will help me and my fellow Chinese strengthen confidence in defeating the disease. I would like to assure my Nigerian friends that China will be able to win the battle.\n\nAs the highly contagious and latent Omicron variant is sweeping the world, multiple Chinese regions have been overshadowed by the current COVID-19 resurgence. But China has been rising to the challenge.\n\nThrough a resolute and full implementation of the dynamic zero-COVID approach, and with the whole-hearted support of the Chinese people, Shenzhen in southern China resumed normal work and production in late March as the resurgence subsides, while community transmission has been cut in Jilin Province since mid-April. Racing against time, Beijing has carried out multiple rounds of nucleic acid testing, and has grasped the basic picture of hidden transmission in society. Data shows the epidemic situation is steadily improving and under effective control in Shanghai. Daily new COVID-19 cases have fallen from a peak of 27,000 to 3,000 at the time of writing , and nearly two-thirds of the infections have recovered in the city. Over 70 percent of Shanghai\u2019s 1,800-plus major enterprises have resumed work and production, and the resumption rate of the first batch of more than 660 key industrial enterprises in the city has exceeded 90 percent.\n\nChina\u2019s anti-epidemic experience has demonstrated that its dynamic zero-COVID policy is not only the best option but also the bottom line that must be maintained for the country\u2019s current epidemic prevention and control work.\n\nYet, the country\u2019s effective anti-pandemic efforts such as temporary lockdowns, brief closures of factories and stores, and suspension of offline classes in schools, have been repeatedly questioned by a number of Western media outlets as being excessively strict. While it is undeniably true that halting normal production can be costly, it is also true that the virus kills.\n\nWorldwide, the virus has claimed over 6 million lives. In sharp contrast, the death toll was about 5,000 on the Chinese mainland.\n\nBy pursuing the dynamic zero-COVID approach, China has managed to safeguard people\u2019s lives and well-being and has minimized the epidemic\u2019s impact on economic and social development to the largest extent.\n\nThe stringent anti-epidemic measures inevitably lead to short-term economic pains, but dynamic zero-COVID is overall a counter-epidemic policy that ensures economic development.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, China\u2019s GDP increased by 4.8 percent year on year. Against the backdrop of global inflation, domestic prices remain steady. The value of goods trade in the period rose 10.7 percent. China\u2019s major industrial firms saw their profits up 8.5 percent year on year.\n\nAs a result, it is not difficult to conclude that China\u2019s dynamic zero-COVID policy complements and bolsters the normal operation of the economy and society. The policy has woven a strong safety net for the 1.4 billion Chinese people.\n\nHumanity is a community with a shared future. Solidarity and cooperation remain the most powerful weapons against global and regional g hands with the rest of the world to combat malaria, or joining international cooperation in the fight against SARS, bird flu, Ebola and COVID-19, China has always been giving a helping hand to other countries to tide over difficulties.\n\nFacing the COVID-19 pandemic, China has carried out its largest emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. It has provided hundreds of billions of anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations and supplied 2.1 billion doses of vaccine to more than 120 countries and international organizations. It is making COVID-19 vaccines an accessible and affordable public product for developing countries.\n\nFrom eliminating major infectious diseases such as malaria, to promoting international cooperation in the fight against COVID-19, China has always put people and their lives in the first place, which is responsible for not only the health and lives of the Chinese, but also the global public health cause. With concrete actions, China is practicing the vision of building a global community of health for all and building a powerful joint force for the world to fight COVID-19.\n\n*Chu Maoming is China\u2019s ConsulGeneral in Lagos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The security agencies should do the needful before this becomes a religious war.\n\n\"This is nauseating and disheartening indeed. Any politician who failed to mourn with the nation especially the Christians in this sorrowful time should forget our votes in 2023. We will mobilize Christian youths across the nooks and crannies of the country to ensure that such persons are stopped because he or she will be a misrepresentation of the nation. Nigeria is a secular state, not a religious nation.\n\n\"We call on all Christian youths to continue to be peaceful and not take laws into their hands. God must surely fight to avenge the killing of Deborah. Her death will unearth the evil agenda of the wicked ones in Nigeria.\"",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google unveils first smartwatch, new phones, virtual cards and more",
          "text": "Google on Wednesday and Thursday held its annual developer conference where it revealed an expanded line of new products and services.\n\nAt its first in-person developer conference in 3 years, the tech giant announced 3 new smartphones and its first in-house smartwatch as well as plans to release a new tablet next year. Google also announced updates to several of its most popular tools including Maps, Google Translate and its core search product.\n\nHere are some major announcements made:\n\nNew Pixel Watch and Pixel phones\n\nIn 2019, Fitbit was acquired by Google for $2.1 billion, a move many saw as a hint that Google was planning to go head-on with the likes of Apple and Samsung, which are already market leaders in smartwatches.\n\nTwo years later, Google has finally launched its first in-house built watch. The Pixel watch can be paired with Android devices only and is 4G-compatible, which means it can function on its own without being near a phone\u2014but to do this it requires its own data plan.\n\nThe tech giant did not reveal a price for the wearable, but it said it would be a \u201cpremium product\u201d when it launches in the 4th quarter of the year.\n\nThere are already many third-party Android watches which run on Google\u2019s Wear operating system but so far Google has not had its own device until now.\n\nAs part of its annual tradition, Google announced its new mid-tier phone, the Pixel 6A. It also unveiled its next flagship phones: the Pixel 7 Pro with a triple rear camera system and the Pixel 7 with two rear cameras.\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, Google announced that it\u2019s getting back to releasing tablets after announcing that it will be focusing solely on building in 2019. The new Android tablet is set to be released in 2023.\n\nUpdated Search and Maps\n\nSource: Google\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that Google processes approximately 63,000 search queries every second, 5.6 billion searches per day and approximately 2 trillion global searches per year. Google search which started from only text queries has over the years added the option to use voice and picture queries options.\n\nNow Google\u2019s new multi-search feature\u2014Multi-search Near Me\u2014allows users to search using text and images at the same time. The tech giant pointed out that the use cases for this feature include searching for a meal or outfit, and finding local results from restaurants, retailers and more.\n\nSource: Google\n\nFor a long time, Google Map has been the most popular Map app in the world, helping people around the world including Africans navigate through cities and rural areas. Now it\u2019s getting a new feature that allows users to view their cities in a more immersive way.\n\nThe new feature, immersive view, fuses together Street View and aerial imagery in order to offer a digital model of the world and a new way to explore cities, key landmarks, restaurants, venues, and other places of interest.\n\nGoogle maps\u2019 new immersive view for cities comes off as a challenger to Apple\u2019s 3D mode map view. In addition to this, Maps also now offers to find the most fuel-efficient route to get there with eco-friendly routing and offer users the ability to access Google Maps Live View in other third-party apps with the ARCore Geospatial API.\n\nVirtual cards\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle is rolling out virtual credit cards to help protect users\u2019 financial information while they\u2019re shopping online. The feature generates a virtual card number that users can autofill instead of their actual card information on Android mobile devices or in Google\u2019s Chrome browser, masking their real credit card number from the companies they\u2019re shopping from. These virtual cards are typically used for one-time purchases, but users will also be able to use these cards for subscriptions.\n\nVirtual cards will roll out this summer initially only for US users with Visa, Mastercard American Express and Capital One credit cards.\n\nTranslation and AR glasses\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle Translate has added support for 24 additional languages, bringing the total number of languages the product supports to 133.\n\nOver 300 million people across Africa, Asia and South America speak these newly-added languages. 10 of the 24 new languages added to Google Translate are spoken in Ghana, Togo, Sierra Leone, Mali, South Africa, Eritrea, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nClosely related to this announcement was Google unveiling Augmented Reality (AR) glasses that hint it plans to join companies like Snap and Meta who have AR glasses ambitions. Google showed off a pair of AR glasses that were capable of real-time translation during a conversation. The tech giant revealed no details on whether this will be a product people can buy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s first attempt at creating smart glasses was roughly a decade ago, but it didn\u2019t take off as expected due to its limited launch, high initial pricing and privacy concerns.\n\nAds and user privacy\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle made a set of security and privacy announcements which will roll out later in the year.\n\nA notable one is the My Ad Centre hub, a new control centre that will give users more control and visibility over how their ads are personalised across Google\u2019s apps and sites, including Google Search, YouTube, and the Discover feed in Google app.\n\nIt\u2019ll let users customise the types of ads they see by selecting from a range of topics they are interested in or opt to see fewer ads on a given topic. For example, if you want to see fewer ads about fashion, you can indicate.\n\nThe hub will also make it easier for users to request that their personal information such as phone numbers, email and home addresses be scrubbed from search results.\n\nThese announcements come after Google reported its 2022 Q1 revenue which was up 23% from the same period last year, reaching $68 billion, while its net profit dropped to $16.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s $17.9 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank edges close to eNaira use case with much-needed upgrade",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), eNaira, will get an update that will allow it to perform more functions such as bill payment and USSD access.\n\nThis was revealed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Lagos Branch Controller, Bariboloka Koyor, during a sensitisation campaign on the eNaira in Oshodi, Lagos.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, Koyor said, \u201cstarting from next week, there will be an upgrade on the eNaira Speed Wallet app that will allow you to do transactions such as paying for DStv or electric bills or even paying for flight tickets.\u201d\n\nWhat was wrong with the eNaira?\n\nChimezie Chuta, Founder, Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), told Techpoint Africa on a phone call that the upgrade had been in the works for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chuta, the CBDC, which launched in October 2021, had to go through a complete rework as some inconsistencies were revealed.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there were faults that would not have allowed the eNaira to achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nThere were issues with setting up the eNaira Speed Wallet application at launch. In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptance among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out just weeks after launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the Index, over 35,000 transactions have been completed on the eNaira, which was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the Index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll conducted by Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, 36.9% (58) of which voted \u201cI don\u2019t own a Wallet.\u201d\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% (38) of those who own a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira Wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira (*997#) would make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how the eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without Internet connectivity. This includes setting up a wallet and sending and receiving eNaira.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first tier of Speed Wallet users can set up a wallet without a Bank Verification Number (BVN). However, they will have a daily transaction limit of \u20a650,000 ($121.50).\n\nA National Identification Number (NIN) will be required in place of the BVN.

If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing. (Editor\u2019s note: You really don\u2019t.)\n\nHowever, I\u2019m happy. I mean, it\u2019s the weekend again. Aren\u2019t you glad?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, today is Techpoint Africa Pitch Friday! Now, you remember, huh?\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja by 5 p.m.\n\nWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll meet your next startup co-founder or be inspired to start your own. Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "title": "Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

As part of this partnership, MARA will become the official crypto partner of the Central African Republic and an advisor to the President on crypto strategy and planning.\n\nMARA\u2019s launch comes at a critical inflection point in Sub-Saharan Africa. Political and economic instability has led to devaluation of currencies across the region, while the current centralized financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled to tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These tired systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralized alternative.\n\nMARA\u2019s mission is to become the portal to the crypto economy for the African population. While cutting-edge technologies such as cryptocurrency have shown incredible promise among Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s predominantly young and technologically-native population, there are considerable hurdles to using them. Many existing global exchanges cannot operate in the region due to regulatory challenges as well as difficulty reaching the African consumer in an authentic way. These barriers to access significantly restrict both the number of people who can participate in the crypto economy and the potential uses for digital currency in the region.\n\nThe MARA suite of products addresses a variety of essential crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA\u2019s products include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA Wallet \u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\n\u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge. Pro-Exchange \u2013 a full-feature cryptocurrency platform focused on experienced users that offers a comprehensive suite of trading options and technical analysis tools.\n\nMARA Chain \u2013 a layer-1 blockchain, powered by the native MARA token, that gives savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.\n\nThe MARA executive team is led by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin, and Kate Kallot, and is joined by board advisors Kojo Annan and Tatiana Koffman.\n\n\u201cMARA\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing a decentralized alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries,\u201d says Chi Nnadi, co-founder and CEO of MARA. \u201cOur goal is to close the gap in opportunities for Sub-Saharan individuals and establish a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors from North America and Europe, MARA\u2019s onboarding, support, and ecosystem reflects the needs of Africans. KYC/AML is compliant to global standards, and is compatible with international financial regulations. Customer support is easily accessed and will be available in both local and international languages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with MARA as it embarks on building a digital financial system for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d says Schuster Tanger, Co-Founder of TQ Ventures. \u201cWith the right resources, this region has potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. To that end, the local knowledge and specialized skills of the MARA team is quite promising.\u201d\n\nMARA will initially launch in Kenya, Nigeria, and surrounding regions. The MARA Wallet app will be available in the App Store and Google Play stores. Pre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can jump up the queue by referring others, and earn crypto rewards by doing so, while increasing their odds of winning additional prizes and rewards in the process. Once onboarded, the MARA Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time, without processing times or delays.\n\nAbout MARA\n\nMARA is building Africa\u2019s portal to the crypto economy through a Pan-African suite of products that addresses a variety of crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA will initially launch in Kenya and Nigeria, with a simplified user-friendly consumer app through which users can easily buy, sell, send, and withdraw cryptocurrencies. MARA will also launch a pro-exchange for experienced users who prefer a full set of trading options and technical analysis tools. The MARA Chain will launch later in 2022, giving savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy. MARA\u2019s executive team includes former executives from Amazon, PayPal, Uber, NVIDIA, Founders Bank, Rappi, and more.

          "title": "2023: Seven women who want Buhari\u2019s office",
          "text": "In line with the theme of this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day, seven smart, fearless female politicians have indicated interest to \u201cbreak the bias\u201d against female presidency in Nigeria by aspiring for the office of the President in the upcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nIf any of them succeeds, she would, on May 29, 2023, take over from President Muhammadu Buhari, who has been in office since May 29, 2015.\n\nHowever, the number of female aspirants pales into insignificance compared to that of their male counterparts which at the last count was 38 across the political parties.\n\nAnd this is despite the waivers on nomination fees extended to female aspirants by various political parties.\n\nThe female aspirants are Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi of the Social Democratic Party; Uju Ohanenye, first female presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress (APC), Carol Nwosu of the African Action Congress (AAC), Ibinabo Joy Dokubo, also of the APC; Patience Key of the People\u2019s Redemption Party; Olivia Diana Teriela, of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP); and Angela Johnson of the All Progressives Grand Alliance.\n\nOkunnu-Lamidi, who was the first woman to declare her interest in contesting for President of Nigeria in the 2023 general election, said she was motivated by her desire to rekindle hope and make Nigeria work for all Nigerians. Her intention was made known in January this year.\n\nShe said her motivation for vying for presidency stemmed from her desire to make Nigeria work for its diverse populace while also harnessing the undoubted power of its teeming youths.\n\nWhile describing 2023 as a defining moment for the country, the 38-year-old graduate of Business Management restated her confidence in playing a leading role in writing a new history and restoring hope for Nigeria.\n\nOn her part, Ohanenye said the number of male aspirants in the race would not intimidate her.\n\n\u201cI fear that men will want to muscle me out, but I am standing firmly for the people I am here to protect. They will want to push me over, but they cannot intimidate me. It has encouraged me,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOhanenye, a legal practitioner, said there was a need to involve the average person in the country\u2019s governance and create job opportunities for the teeming unemployed youths.\n\n\u201cNigerian youths are brilliant and should not be allowed to be engaged in anti-social activities. I am going to localise the construction of roads and many other things,\u201d she said.\n\nRead also: The persistent marginalisation of women in Nigeria\n\nNwosu of the AAC said if elected into office, her government would give unalloyed support to the oneness and unity of Nigeria, stressing that she was committed to building a united, peaceful and harmonious nation with the ability to accommodate and cater for all her citizens.\n\nShe said she would tackle the challenges that have bedevilled the nation\u2019s quest for a strong and stable federation and unlock its potential.\n\nShe also pledged to give 35 percent of appointments to Nigerian women, youths and people living with disability.\n\nDespite the interest already shown by these women, political analysts say it is still a far cry from the 35 percent affirmative action approved by the United Nations. The seven women represent less than 20 percent of the 38 male presidential aspirants.\n\nChinwe Obaji, former minister of education, said she expected more women to take part in politics as that was the only way to wrest power from the men and give women a pride of place in the polity.\n\n\u201cI applaud the women that have indicated interest to contest for various positions in the country as well as their fresh push for more accommodation. With this development, women are expected to make more impact in the 2023 general election compared to their efforts in the previous presidential polls,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the last 60 years of Independence, not many women have shown keen interest in contesting for the office of the president or state governor.\n\nIn 1999, only two candidates \u2013 Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP and Olu Falae of the Alliance for Democracy, AD/All Peoples Party, slugged it out, with Obasanjo emerging the winner.\n\nSo far, 2003 remains the best attempt by women to occupy the presidential villa also called Aso Villa. Of the 20 presidential candidates, two were women \u2013 Sarah Jubril of the Progressive Action Congress, and Mojisola Adekunle Obasanjo of the Masses Movement of Nigeria.\n\nWhile Mojisola Obasanjo polled 3,757 votes at that election, Jubril scored 157,560 votes, the highest any woman has ever got in a presidential election in the country.\n\nSince then, the fortunes of women have been dwindling at the presidential polls. In a pool of 27 candidates in 2007, there was only one woman \u2013 Mojisola Obasanjo, who garnered a miserly 4,309 votes.\n\nIn 2011, with 63 political parties, 20 of which fielded candidates, there was also only one woman \u2013 Ebiti Ndok of the United National Party for Development, who polled 21,2017 votes.\n\nSarah Jubril\u2019s efforts to be on the ballot did not succeed. She got one vote at the PDP presidential primary.\n\nThe 2015 presidential election was not different; Oluremi Sonaiya, a professor, was the only female in a crowd of 14 presidential candidates. She got 13,076 votes.\n\nThe presidential election held in 2019 had 73 candidates, including six women \u2013 the highest so far in the history of Nigeria\u2019s political system.\n\nAs was the case in previous elections, women altogether polled 25,594. While Buhari got 15,191,847 of the total votes cast, his closest rival Atiku Abubakar of the PDP got 11,262,978 votes, with a wide margin of 3,928,869.\n\nThe female presidential aspirants were Oby Ezekwesili (ACPN, 7,223 votes); Angela Johnson (AUN, 1,092 votes); Olufunmilayo Adesanya-Davies (MAJA, 2,651 votes); Eunice Atuejide (NIP, 2,248 votes); Rabia Yasai Hassan Cengiz (NAC, 2,279); and Maina Maimuna Kyari (NPC, 10,081) votes.",

The respondents affirmed that they would invest in the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) if it ever approached the market.\n\nAigbogun noted that in making the decision, the Awards Review Committee was guided by the achievements of Ossiomo Power and Infrastructure Limited, which include its \u201ctrack record as an independent power company dedicated to providing power to the Benin Industrial and Enterprise Park as well as several local communities in Edo State. Other considerations are the company\u2019s contributions towards attracting new businesses and investors through the development of critical infrastructure; demonstrated commitment to national and economic development and the local jobs it has created.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has blamed the increasing rate of drug abuse in the state on the lingering strike action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nAddressing journalists after the state\u2019s security council meeting at Government House in Benin City, he said drug abuse is the second biggest security threat in the state.\n\nThe security meeting was attended by representatives of various security agencies in the state.\n\nHe said the the state recorded 19 drug abuse cases for the month of February, 34 cases for the month of March, and 23 similar cases for the month of April.\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cDrug abuse ranks among the top two of serious security concerns in our state. Our analysis shows that there is a high rate of consumption of illicit drugs in the last few months which is not unconnected with the lingering ASUU strike which has kept many students at home and idle.\n\n\u201cThe strike is one of the factors that is driving the use of illicit drugs in our state. I therefore use the opportunity of this council meeting to appeal to ASUU and the federal government to do all they can to please end this strike as soon as possible for the interest of the children of this country so that we don\u2019t keep them at home, destroying their lives.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop. One way we hope that we can reduce the use of drugs is if we take these children back to school.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the other is the rate of accidents. We have observed slight reduction because of the rain and we also want to use this medium to further appeal to the federal government that the major arterial roads, the major truck roads leading into Edo be repaired, particularly the Benin-Auchi and Okpekpe-Okene Roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese roads account for quite a number of the deaths we have recorded as a result of vehicular accidents. The state has enjoyed relative decline in other incidents, which shows that Edo is becoming safer,\u201d the governor said.\n\nIn his response, Edo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abutu Yaro, said that the facts speak for itself, noting that Edo is safer now than before.\n\nThe Police Commissioner said the security agencies will continue to do their best in improving the security situation.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nFormer Senate President Bukola Saraki says Nigeria must get it right by voting him as the next president of the country in the 2023 general elections.\n\nSaraki, a Presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), stated this on Saturday in Asaba while soliciting the support of the Delta State party delegates to fly the PDP presidential ticket, ahead of the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nHe said Nigeria needed a courageous and business-conscious leader to tackle the security and economic challenges facing the country.\n\nHe said the country needed to be fixed urgently, adding \u201cwe cannot afford to make the mistake of not putting the right person because the insecurity that we are all suffering today in this country does not know tribe or religion.\n\n\u201cBoth northerners and southerners are suffering the poverty and insecurity; we have highest level of unemployment today at 33 per cent and cost of living is very high.\n\n\u201cWith the numerous challenges facing our nation today, we need to find people who have the capacity to lead because leadership is key today in this country; you cannot give what you do not have.\n\n\u201cThere are certain qualities that we need today from the next president, and if those qualities are what I have, let us do the right thing and support me.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody who can unite Nigeria, who the youths and the old, North and South can be comfortable with.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody who can bring investments, who the private sector would be comfortable with, somebody who would also have the courage to stand for what is right and take bold decisions when that time comes\u201d.\n\nSaraki added that the country needed a president that was business-friendly and understood the private sector and able to change the country\u2019s mono-economy status.\n\n\u201cAs you all know as entrepreneurs, money only goes to where it sees safety. A president or government that is business-friendly is what we need now, one who understands the private sector.\n\n\u201cI was happy today when I got in to the Asaba Airport and I looked and compared it to about a year ago; you can see the difference and the innovation of the governor in bringing that change.\n\n\u201cWe need a president that is bold and courageous to take decisions. It is not going to be easy because the challenges ahead are enormous.\n\n\u201cDevolution of powers is so important; we must be able to restructure this country and give more powers to states.\n\n\u201cYou need somebody who has the capacity to do that and you all know that to restructure, you need constitutional amendments; so you need somebody with legislative experience that can unite this country.\n\n\u201cSomebody, whether in the North or South, that will be fair to all and you know that I am that person that can unite this country.\n\n\u201cWhen the party needed somebody to reconcile our party members, I was brought on board to chair the National Reconciliation Committee of our great party and today many states have come together because of the work we did.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody that can bridge the gap between the young and the old. We need somebody that can create jobs and shore up employment and that can only be done through agriculture, through non-reliance on oil.\n\n\u201cI have stated this in my manifesto that within 24 months, we will earn the same amount we are earning from 30 billion dollars from non-oil \u2013 whether it is gas or petrochemical, and unless we do that, if we continue to rely on oil we can\u2019t get away from the current challenges.\n\n\u201cI am a great team player and we were able to hold the National Assembly together because we were able to carry everyone along,\u201d Saraki said.\n\nOn his part, Gov. Okowa said that the country truly needed a leader who had what it takes to provide solutions to the myriads of problems bedeviling the country.\n\nHe congratulated Saraki for his role in the 8th Senate, describing him as a very bold and courageous leader who stood to defend the independence of the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe people of Delta are very knowledgeable people; they have heard you and I believe that during the time of discussion it is our prayer that you find favour in the sight of the delegates.\n\nEarlier, Chairman of PDP in Delta, Chief Kingsley Esiso, said that the party\u2019s hierarchy would meet and take the right decision.\n\nHe commended Saraki for the visit.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are also expecting an influential presidential aspirant from the opposition to join the APC.\n\n\u201cSo, you can see the party is very progressive and properly ready for Lawan\u2019s emergence.\u201d\n\nOn the call for the postponement of primary by some political parties, Kalu said he did not expect the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to listen to them.\n\nHe said the parties were duly informed and should have prepared well as mandated by the electoral body.\n\n\u201cExtension of the dates will only support irresponsibility. Nigerians find it difficult to keep to time and appointments and that is why they would always seek extra time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI support INEC to stick to their timetable, otherwise we will be living with postponement after postponement. Such a trend is not healthy for a society and its people.\n\n\u201cWe complain of indiscipline but not ready to be practical about the requirements of discipline.

We must commend you and your team for the giant strides you have made in all sectors.\n\n\u201cYour government has taken security as topmost priority; you have continuously invested in the sector with the resultant effect on the peaceful atmosphere reigning in the nooks and crannies of the State.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, security is the bedrock of socioeconomic development.\n\nIf there is no security, nothing can be achieved. It gladdens our hearts that your government has done a lot to change the face of Osun and you are still doing all to keep the State.\n\n\u201cIndeed, your record will speak for you. Whether they like it or not, Osun will continue to remain great and peaceful.\n\n\u201cOur presence here has further exposed us to so many good things you have achieved. We have been briefed on your tremendous support for security outfits and personnel and for this singular reason, we are ready to continue to support you in this regard to keep Osun safe.\n\n\u201cIn the course of our tour, we were taken to some of the Primary Healthcare Centres revitalised and fully equipped by your administration. I have seen all you have done in the health sector. Even my village was not left out of this benefit.\n\n\u201cOur prayer is for God to continue to guide and protect you as you move the State forward\u201d, he said.\n\nIn his brief remarks, Governor Oyetola thanked the members of the delegation for choosing the State and for taking the trouble to travel down to Osun on the need to proffer solutions to adverse effects of climate change in the country.\n\nOyetola who seized the opportunity to reel out some of his government\u2019s interventions to ensure favourable climatic and atmospheric conditions in the state said several efforts had been made to keep Osun afloat despite the effects of the global climate change.\n\nGovernor Oyetola reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to continuing to champion the cause of the masses through the provision of quality, responsible and responsive leadership on all fronts.",

Aminu Waziri Tambuwal for his prompt declaration of 24-hours curfew to calm the ongoing protests in the state.\n\nThe protesters had earlier attacked the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral at Bello Road and St. Kevin\u2019s Catholic Church, Gidan Dere, destroying windows and a community bus parked within the premises.\n\nAlthough, no life was lost during the protest. The development however prompted Governor Tambuwal to swiftly declare a 24-hours curfew in the city. He also cancelled his consultative visits.\n\nRecall that the governor was billed to visit six states for the ongoing consultations over his presidential bid. He however canceled the visits to ensure normalcy is restored to the state. \u201cThe peace of the state is more important than my aspiration\u201d he noted.\n\nReacting, Most Reverend Kukah, in a statement signed by the Director of Social Communications of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Reverend Father Christopher A.

          "text": "A Kaduna based Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, has stated that any Muslim who kills a Christian in Nigeria for insulting or blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad (SAW) will not smell paradise.\n\nSpeaking while reacting to the killing of Sokoto student, Deborah Samuel, over alleged blasphemy against the Prophet, Gumi said Nigeria is not an Islamic state, adding that Muslims in the country have agreement with people of other faiths to live together peacefully and anyone who kills others on religious guise has committed a grievous sin.\n\nThe Islamic scholar lamented in one of his preachings at Sultan Bello Mosque in Kaduna, that it was unfortunate that some Muslim clerics were quoting verses they don\u2019t understand and telling people to kill whoever insults their religion.\n\nQuoting some Quranic verses and jurisprudence, the cleric said killing a non-Muslim under the guise of blasphemous statement against Prophet Muhammad was not a tenable excuse.\n\n\u201cAllah has told us in the Qur\u2019an that non-Muslims will insult Allah and His Prophet. In fact, it is now the blasphemy will start after the killing of that lady in Sokoto, the insult will increase, not reduce,\u201d he said.\n\nGumi noted that some Nigerian Muslims that want to defend Prophet Muhammad should be ashamed of themselves because they are corrupt, adding that \u201cthe best way to go if we want to defend the Prophet, is to follow his teachings. We the clerics need to wake up and teach the Muslims their religion. We must leave this state of ignorance, we have turned like animals.\n\n\u201cWe the Muslims are not the only ones in this country. We must know that there was nothing the unbelievers did not do to Prophet Muhammad, but he was patient, because he was concious that if he killed them, the unbelievers he was trying to bring to the fold of Islam will tag him a killer. There are people who are neither Muslims not Christians in Nigeria, and everyone is trying to win their souls.\n\n\u201cAlso, there are people who are not Muslims, whom we are preaching Islam to, so that they can enter the fold of Islam and be salvaged in the hereafter. If we now begin to kill people, they will say it is even from the leader of our faith, Prophet Muhammad that we have learnt it. They will say their religion is a religion of bloodletting. At a time we are trying to draw attention of people to see the beauty of Islam, we are now scaring them away.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that, we even see some clerics who are telling people that whoever insults your religion, just kill them. They are quoting verses they don\u2019t understand. There is no one who has the will to kill anyone except through the Islamic justice system. And in doing this, the conditions of such justice must be completed before anyone can be killed.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nAssociation of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has developed a roadmap campaign plan needed to save the naira from further decline and enhance exchange rate stability.\n\nThe ABCON National Executive Council said the move to save the naira was agreed by the body at the conclusion of its meeting in Lagos, where it unveiled strategies for save the local currency, bridge the exchange rate gaps and curb volatility in the forex market.\n\nThe naira exchanges at N596 to dollar at the parallel market and N415.83 to dollar at the official market creating a rate gap of N180.17 per dollar.\n\nThe ABCON President, Alhaji (Dr) Aminu Gwadabe said there was urgent need to enhance dollar liquidity in the market and ensure stability of prices in the economy.\n\nThese steps, he said would save the local currency and economy from the impact of election spending that has kept inflation at double digits for a very long time.\n\nThe ABCON boss disclosed that the depreciation of the naira against global currencies was due to pressure from rising dollar demand without sufficient liquidity to meet the demands from retail end users, manufacturers and other key players in the economy.\n\n\u201cThe naira has consistently come under serious pressure due to dollar scarcity making it difficult for forex end users, manufacturers and key industry players to access dollar needed to meet their needs. ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market. The suggested the strengthening of over 4,500 BDCs to bring forex closer to the retail end users and boost market liquidity.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that with the establishment of world class healthcare facilities in Nigeria, the country was set to become a destination for medical tourism, in addition to reversing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nMohammed who spoke after a media tour of Duchess International Hospital in Lagos, said the world class healthcare facilities springing up in Nigeria will also curb medical tourism abroad, conserve foreign reserves and create jobs.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here at the Duchess International Hospital. During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nHALO Financial Services Ltd, a fintech start-up has launched with an innovative approach to help Nigerians manage and grow their money.\n\nSpeaking at a media round table to introduce the company, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Chidimma Onyeokoro disclosed that Halo enables communities to provide financial services to their members. Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses. We have a micro finance bank license and an asset management license. This allows us to offer a full spectrum of financial services from basic banking to sophisticated investments. It also means we are regulated by both SEC and CBN, so our risk management and corporate governance is very rigorous.\u2019\n\nNoting that the company is keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offers multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, there is an app, mass market customers can transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities can access a managed service.\n\nShe stated that the fintech space in Nigeria is extremely competitive, so to meet Halo\u2019s very ambitious goals they have built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities, and more importantly, possess the right skills and experience to help communities and their members navigate the financial landscape and reach their goals.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Federal Government is working on a funding structure for public universities in the country as part of moves to tackle the incessant strikes by lecturers in these institutions.\n\nThis is according to the former Minister of State for Education Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba who noted that the government\u2019s funding of public universities is unsustainable.\n\n\u201cI have proposed, and the Minister of Education (Adamu Adamu) will continue discussing this with Mr President, a new scheme in which universities have a different way of earning money to be able to care for themselves,\u201d he said on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics.\n\nThe presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 election maintained that with the number of public universities in the country, these schools have to get new ways of making money to fund their institutions.\n\n\u201cBecause you see, there are only 50 of these federal universities and there are 200 others. However, these 50 alone are more than 75 percent of the number of students in the entire university structure \u2013 about 2.2m of them,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important we give them a funding structure; we need to bring a funding structure to the table because this coming hand-in-cap to the Federal Government at all times cannot be continued and is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: APC Inaugurates Screening Committees In Abuja\n\n\u2018Point of Departure\u2019\n\nNwajiuba, who last week resigned his position in the cabinet to concentrate on his presidential dream, said \u201cthis (a new funding structure) is something I would implement if you give me your mandate to be president.\n\n\u201cI know that even if it is not implemented now, the universities autonomy law needs to be reactivated.\u201d\n\nThe former minister\u2019s comment adds to the debates about funding for public universities in the country. Lecturers in these institutions have been on strike since February 14, pushing their demands, which include better funding for universities.\n\nBut the APC chieftain believes ASUU should reconsider strike as a means to press home their demands.\n\n\u201cIn the last 20 years, we have had nearly 16 strikes. So, my position has not been that \u2018Please, ASUU is talking rubbish\u2019,\u201d Nwajiuba said. \u201cNo, this is not true. ASUU is making a case for the entire university system.\n\nHe, however, said, \u201cthe only point of departure is that we have asked ASUU that strikes cannot cure the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need our children back in school. It hurts parents; it hurts us,\u201d the presidential aspirant noted. \u201cMy own children are here. I don\u2019t have children in private universities.\u201d",

He livestreamed the attack online.\n\nUS President Joe Biden condemned what he called an \u201cabhorrent\u201d act.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism,\u201d said Stephen Belongia, from the FBI\u2019s Buffalo office, adding there was evidence of \u201cracial animosity.\u201d\n\nCBS news reported that the attacker shouted racial slurs during the shooting and suggested that he had a racial slur written on his weapon. He also apparently posted a manifesto online which included racist language and ideas.\n\nThe suspect is believed to have driven for some 200 miles to reach the predominantly black area of the city. Thirteen people were shot in total and the majority of the victims were black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said.\n\n\u201cHe exited his vehicle. He was very heavily armed.
