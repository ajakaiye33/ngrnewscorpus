I will bring that aspect into the basket and quickly develop the state to match the dreams and vision of the present administration.\n\n\u201cEbonyi indeed has been blessed with visionary leaders simply because our very first executive Governor, Distinguished Sen. Dr Sam Ominyi Egwu built a solid foundation upon which Chief Martin Elechi took off from.\n\n\u201cWith the present challenges facing Nigeria and Ebonyi State now, Ebonyi requires a man of ideas. It takes a man who can create wealth to manage wealth.\n\nDr Ezeh called on PDP to ensure that zoning in maintained in Ebonyi State noting that Ebonyi State was created as a prayer answered from oppression and neglect.\n\n\u201cWe are one people.\n\nWe must do all to bring down the tension around equity and zoning\u201d.\n\nHe called on professionals and technocrats to embrace politics noting the words of Haile Selessie that \u201cevil thrives when people who should speak keep silent\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that Dr Ezeh is the current President of Ebonyi Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture and also the 2nd Deputy President, South East Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (SECCIMA) and National Officer of NACCIMA the head of organized private sector (OPS) in Nigeria.

That is why today we have to talk about security in the whole of Europe. That is our main goal \u2013 peace in Ukraine and the security of our citizens.\n\n\u201cFor this, we are ready to talk to everyone, including you. In different formats and in any place.\u201d\n\nAs Russian troops closed in on Kyiv yesterday, Zelenskyy issued a new statement urging talks.\n\n\u201cI would like to address the President of the Russian Federation once again. Fighting is going on all over Ukraine. Let\u2019s sit down at the negotiating table to stop the deaths of people,\u201d he said.\n\nKyiv has floated the idea that Ukraine could promise to take a neutral status on NATO membership in order to end the violence.\n\nPutin urges Ukraine army to remove govt\n\nLater yesterday, Putin called on the Ukrainian army to overthrow the government whose leaders he described as \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201ca gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis\u201d.\n\nPutin also accused \u201cUkrainian nationalists\u201d of deploying heavy weapons in residential areas of major cities to provoke the Russian military, without providing evidence; a claim that could fuel fears Moscow is creating pretexts for justifying civilian casualties.\n\nIn a televised address, he urged the Ukrainian military to \u201ctake power in your own hands\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt seems like it will be easier for us to agree with you than this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,\u201d he said, referring to Zelenskyy\u2019s government.\n\nNATO holds emergency summit over crisis\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said yesterday that U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts have agreed to send parts of the organisation\u2019s response force to help protect allies in the east over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking after chairing a NATO meeting, Stoltenberg said the leaders decided to send parts of the NATO Response Force and elements of a quickly deployed spearhead unit.\n\nHe did not say how many troops would be deployed, but confirmed that the move would involve land, sea and air power.\n\nThe NRF can number up to 40,000 troops, but Stoltenberg said that NATO would not be deploying the entire force.\n\nParts of a force known in NATO jargon as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), which is currently led by France, will also be sent.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday released a video of himself and his senior aides in Kyiv to reassure the nation as Russian troops were closing in on the capital.\n\nIn the video Zelenskyy recorded in the street outside the presidential office, he said he and his top officials were staying in the capital.\n\n\u201cOur troops are here, citizens are here,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that \u201cAll of us are here protecting the independence of our country. And it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, Glory to Ukraine, Glory to Heroes.\u201d\n\nRussian troops bore down on Ukraine\u2019s capital yesterday with gunfire and explosions resonating ever closer to the government quarter.\n\nIn the fog of war, it was unclear how much of Ukraine remained under Ukrainian control and how much or little Russian forces had seized.",

They both met the deadline of February 24, 2022 as set by the Commission\u201d.\n\n\u201cArising from this and on behalf of the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the Board and Management of the NCC, I wish to congratulate the MTN and Mafab for this feat, as we look forward to accomplishing other deployment timelines in the 5G deployment roadmap, as articulated in the National Policy on 5G Networks for Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy\u201d, Danbatta stated.\n\n\u201cFor meeting the payment deadline, Danbatta has commended the two companies for their commitment to 5G deployment drive through their private investments, which he said, was a demonstration of the licensees\u2019 belief in the sound regulatory environment in the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cDanbatta also expressed appreciation to the Federal Government for its support and commitment to the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria which, he said, will bring substantial network improvements, including higher connection speed, mobility and capacity, as well as low-latency capabilities to communications services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Commission published a Public Notice on its decision to award two lots of 100MHz Time Division Duplex (TDD) available in the 3.5 GHz band through an auction process, to support the delivery of ubiquitous broadband services for the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, an Information Memorandum (IM) was issued on November 10, 2021, in which Bid Applications for the available spectrum lots were invited. By the deadline for receipt of applications on November 29, 2021, the Commission received applications from three licensed telecommunications companies, namely: Airtel Networks Limited, Mafab Communications Limited, and MTN Communications Nigeria Plc.\n\n\u201cThe Auction held successfully on Monday, December 13, 2021 at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja with the three bidders competing for the available two lots in which the Commission adopted the Ascending Clock Auction format that ended after Round 11, and proceeded to the Assignment Stage.\n\n\u201cIn the auction, MTN and Mafab emerged provisional licence winners and arising from this, the winning bid price for the auction was put at $273.6 million for each lot of 100 MHz TDD. The Provisional licence winners were then directed to pay the Winning Bid Price less the Intention-to-Bid Deposit, by February 24, 2022.\n\n\u201cIndustry stakeholders and observers have commended the Commission for the auction process, described as efficient, fair, well-organised and transparent; as well as designed to deliver the ideal outcome which saw the strongest bidders emerge as winners, raising a substantial amount for the Federal Government and setting the stage for the next phase in Nigeria\u2019s 5G roadmap.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari at exactly 12:27 signed the long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, into law.\n\nThe ceremony was witnessed by the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and some members of National Assembly committee on Independent and Electoral Commission (INEC), held at the Council Chambers of the State House.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, tabled the document for signing.\n\nThe President urged the National Assembly to give speedy attention to amendments suggested, especially deleting 84 (12), which contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote, or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nHe said the Act holds a lot of promise for improving the election processes in the country, with introduction of new technology, and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.\n\nHe said: \u201cDistinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nQuoting the section, he said \u201c84(12) No political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nThe President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.\n\nAdding:\n\n\u201cThe practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari commended the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said he received inputs from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government, after careful and thorough reviews of the Bill and its implications to democratic processes, before signing The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 into law.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that the National Assembly forwarded the Electoral Bill for Presidential Assent, via a letter dated 31st January, 2022.\n\nSenate President, commended Buhari for signing the bill into law despite his reservations on 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022.\n\nOn Buhari\u2019s request, Lawan said: \u201cYou know, this is a legitimate request. And that is why I commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he had a disagreement with the section, especially clause 84(12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.\n\n\u201cSo we will look at what he is asking, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of essence, INEC is waiting. And because we don\u2019t want to spill over some of these dates, unnecessarily.\n\n\u201cWe will be expecting a communication from Mr. President with respect to this. And then the National Assembly in both chambers will look into the request for amendment but I on the whole I think this is a wonderful development for this administration, for Nigeria, for the evolution and development and growth of democracy in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker, Gbajabiamila, described the signing as a landmark turning point in the political history after 12 years.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe it\u2019s a landmark piece of legislation, and has far reaching and I mean, far reaching implications of the provisions contained therein. I can count off head at least 10 to 15 provisions in that electoral law, that if properly executed by INEC, and the people who the laws are made for, it will be a turning point in electoral Electoral history of Nigeria. And we will not just be mouthing free, fair and credible elections, but we will actually witness free, fair and credible elections moving forward.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m happy that this day has come. It\u2019s been long coming. And I\u2019m sure everybody will be happy. I must say just like what the Senate president said. We must give it to this ninth assembly. I mean, even if we have to toot our horns in the sense that we\u2019re barely three years into our tenure we\u2019ve not even going into our fourth year yet, yet this ninth assembly has been able to put on the table for Nigerians landmark legislation and this is just another one of them.\n\n\u201cSo we have over a year left and I believe I\u2019m will begin to polish off some other piece of legislation but the major ones, we have dispatched with in the interest of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNational Chairman, Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Yabagi Sani, said the new electoral act has put paid to electoral violence.\n\nHe said: \u201cwe have gotten the fundamental ground norms that will ensure that elections are credible, peaceful, and also by bringing in the electronic transfer of results from the polling units, that, in itself has cut out a lot of things that have bedeviled electoral processes in this country.\n\n\u201cToday, we can certainly say that the amount of money spent on elections would definitely be reduced. We can also say that the kind of violence that we normally witness will be, if not completely absent, reduced to the barest minimum.\u201d\n\nOn if there will be level playing field for everybody including the smaller parties, he said: \u201cI believe that it will, because it\u2019s, in itself a step forward, it\u2019s like, a great leap forward in terms of laying the foundation for credible, reliable and free elections. But one thing, like you rightly mentioned, is the issue of money politics, because still at the polling unit, unless the law enforcement officers, arise to the occasion, we will still have cases of people who have been manipulated, the vote has been manipulated with money. And I believe that the laws are there, but what is lacking is the enforcement of those laws.\u201c",

On the other hand, global markets plunged.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the invasion by land, air, and sea began after a pre-dawn TV address, where the Russian President demanded that Ukraine\u2019s military lay down their arms. Initial reports of casualties included Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, and Russian troops.\n\nThe Ukraine\u2019s leader had said his country \u201cwon\u2019t give up its freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted.\n\nUkraine declared martial law and severed all diplomatic relations with Russia. It said weapons would be given to anyone who wanted them.\n\nThe Russian attack began around 4:30 am in Ukraine yesterday, with a barrage of over 100 ballistic, cruise and surface-to-air missiles, and included 75 medium and heavy bombers. Experts said the invasion was the largest in Europe since World War II. The fighting, described as an initial phase, could potentially become very bloody and very costly, they added.\n\nExplosions were heard in major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa. Oleksii Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said at least 40 people had been killed and dozens others wounded in the attack so far.\n\nUkrainian authorities said Russian forces had hit military assets and other defence facilities, while footage shared by Ukrainian border guards showed Russian military vehicles moving across the border from Crimea.\n\nZelenskyy had announced that Ukraine had cut diplomatic ties with Russia, declaring martial law and offering to issue weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Despite pleas to stay home, people in Kyiv were jamming roads to leave.\n\nBut as global outrage swelled, Putin met with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan yesterday. The prime minister\u2019s office posted a video to Twitter of the two leaders shaking hands and said the pair would discuss \u201cthe entire gamut of Pakistan-Russia bilateral cooperation, and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.\u201d\n\nU.S Reaction\n\nPresident Joe Biden yesterday forcefully condemned Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a premeditated attack and a brutal assault \u201cwithout provocation, without justification, without necessity.\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin has been planning this for months.\u201d\n\nBiden announced new sanctions that included banning exports to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe have purposely designed these sanctions to maximise a long-term impact on Russia and to minimise impact on the United States and our allies,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden used his strongest language to date about Putin, saying the U.S. and allies will make sure he becomes \u201cpariah on the international stage.\u201d\n\nBiden met earlier yesterday morning with his national security team and world leaders, hours after Putin ordered the attack on Ukraine in the predawn darkness.\n\nThe U.S. already has about 90,000 troops in Europe and has deployed more to the continent as tensions simmered in the weeks before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this month, about 5,000 US-based forces were sent to Europe and US military personnel already there had been shifting to help bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nBiden said members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and others had joined a global coalition to amplify a united response. He also said G-7 leaders agreed to limit Russia\u2019s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen. The president said the US would block four more major banks in addition to the sanctions imposed on VTB and Russia\u2019s military bank.\n\nBiden said the United States was taking steps to defend NATO allies.\n\nThe organisation will convene a summit today, which would \u201cbring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cThis aggression cannot go unanswered. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom,\u201d he added.\n\nBiden said his administration was going to use \u201cevery tool\u201d to protect Americans and businesses from rising gas prices.\n\nHe called on American oil and gas companies to \u201cnot exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.\u201d\n\nThe US president said, \u201cOur sanctions package is specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue. We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption.\u201d\n\nThe White House sounded the alarm last week to prepare the country for potential cyber-attacks on US companies or key parts of U.S. critical infrastructure, including pipelines, banks, commercial aviation, and hospitals.\n\nClinton Condemns \u2018Unprovoked and Unjustified\u2019 Russian attack on Ukraine\n\nFormer US President Bill Clinton yesterday condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, joining world leaders, past and present, in rebuking Putin.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s war of choice has unravelled 30 years of diplomacy, with the potential for mass civilian casualties and huge displacements both within Ukraine\u2019s borders and beyond,\u201d Clinton said in a prepared statement posted to his Twitter account.\n\nHe called the invasion \u201cunprovoked and unjustified\u201d and a \u201cbrazen violation of international law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world will hold Russia and Russia alone accountable, both economically and politically,\u201d he said.\n\nUK\u2019s Johnson Outlines Severe Sanctions against Russia, Belarus\n\nIn his address today, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged a \u201cvast invasion\u201d is underway and said the world \u201ccannot allow that freedom\u201d of Ukraine to be \u201csnuffed out\u201d.\n\nHe assured the UK will \u201cdo what more we can in the days ahead\u201d, including agreeing a \u201cmassive package of economic sanctions\u201d.\n\nJohnson continued, \u201cOur mission is clear: diplomatically, politically, economically and, eventually, militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Putin must end in failure.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister addressed the people of Russia, Ukraine and Britain separately in his address, telling those in Russia that he \u201ccannot believe\u201d the invasion has been launched \u201cin your name\u201d.\n\nHe assured Ukrainians the UK was \u201con [their] side\u201d, and told Brits the government \u201cwill do everything to keep our country safe\u201d, including working with allies for \u201chowever long it takes\u201d to ensure the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine was restored.\n\nJohnson said the United Kingdom was imposing \u201cthe largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen\u201d and that sanctions would also apply to Belarus for its role in Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine.\n\nIn coordination with the US, Johnson said the United Kingdom was imposing a \u201cfull asset freeze\u201d on the Russian-owned bank VTB that will effectively exclude Russian banks from UK\u2019s financial system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to tell the House that the United States is taking similar measures,\u201d Johnson told the House of Commons.\n\nHe said the UK would implement new trade and export restrictions similar to what the US would also impose\n\nThe prime minister said Russian companies, both private and state-owned, would be prohibited from raising funds in the UK, taking loans out of the UK, and making securities transactions in the UK\n\n\u201cThis includes all the major manufacturers that support Putin\u2019s war machine,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of protesters yesterday gathered in London to urge Britain and other democracies to step up action against Russia. Ukrainians living in the UK and activists gathered outside the prime minister\u2019s Downing Street office singing the Ukrainian national anthem.\n\nNatalia Ravlyuk, who helped organise the protest, said they wanted the \u201ctoughest sanctions and total isolation of Russia now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feel betrayed by democratic states because we have been talking about this war for eight years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just need to wake up and stop Putin now,\u201d the Associated Press quoted her as saying.\n\nNATO chief: Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion \u2018cold-blooded\u2019 and \u2018long-planned\u2019\n\nNATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, described Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as \u201cdeliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned,\u201d accusing Putin of \u201cusing force to re-write history.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, Stoltenberg called for a summit of NATO alliance leaders on Friday to address Moscow\u2019s military incursion into neighbouring Ukraine and said the military alliance would be bolstering its land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank. Stoltenberg confirmed NATO did not have any troops inside Ukraine and did not plan to send any, but said the alliance was still committed to providing Kyiv with military and technical support.\n\nUkraine is not a member of NATO but other countries close to the theatre of conflict, including Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania, are. Under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, all are entitled to direct military support if their \u201cterritorial integrity, political independence or security\u201d is threatened.\n\nG-7 leaders: Putin Has Put Himself on Wrong Side of History\u2019\n\nFollowing a virtual meeting yesterday morning, leaders of the G-7 issued a joint statement announcing they would bring forward \u201csevere and coordinated economic and financial sanctions\u201d and calling on the global community to condemn the attack in the strongest terms possible.\n\nThe leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, along with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, and NATO Secretary-General called the unfolding conflict \u201ca serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe.\u201d\n\nThe leaders called on Moscow to end the bloodshed and condemned Belarus\u2019 involvement in Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis has fundamentally changed the Euro-Atlantic security situation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cPresident Putin has re-introduced war to the European continent. He has put himself on the wrong side of history.\u201d\n\nGeorge Bush: Invasion Unprovoked, Unjustified\u2019\n\nIn a similar vein, former US President George W. Bush condemned Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine as \u201cthe gravest security crisis on the European continent since World War II.\u201d\n\nThe invasion was \u201cunprovoked and unjustified,\u201d Bush said in a statement.\n\nBush, who once described Putin as \u201cvery straightforward and trustworthy,\u201d said the US government and the American people must stand in solidarity with Ukraine and its people as they sought freedom \u201cand the right to choose their own future.\n\n\u201cWe cannot tolerate the authoritarian bullying and danger that Putin poses.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cUkraine is our friend and democratic ally and deserves our full support during this most difficult time.\u201d\n\nOil Prices Hit $105 Per Barrel\n\nOil prices jumped yesterday with Brent rising above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, after Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine exacerbated concerns about disruptions to global energy supply.\n\nSenior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, Louise Dickson, told Reuters, \u201cOil prices are soaring with no end in sight as the news of Russia\u2019s full-scale military incursion of Ukraine, immediately putting at risk up to 1 million bpd (barrels per day) of Russian crude oil exports transitioning through Ukraine and the Black Sea,\u201d\n\nAt least three major buyers of Russian oil were unable to open letters of credit from Western banks to cover purchases on Thursday, sources told Reuters.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude rose $6.61, or 6.8 per cent, to $103.45, after touching a high of $105.79.\n\nAlso, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped $4.78, or 5.2 per cent, to $96.88 a barrel, after earlier rising to $100.54. Brent and WTI hit their highest since August and July 2014, respectively.\n\n\u201cRussia is the third-largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter. Given low inventories and dwindling spare capacity, the oil market cannot afford large supply disruptions,\u201d UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.\n\n\u201cSupply concerns may also spur oil stockpiling activity, which supports prices.\u201d\n\nRussia is also the largest provider of natural gas to Europe, providing about 35 per cent of its supply.\n\nChina warned of the impact of tensions on the stability of the energy market.\n\n\u201cAll countries that are truly responsible should take responsible actions to jointly maintain global energy security,\u201d a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said.\n\nGlobally, oil supplies remain tight as demand recovers from pandemic lows.\n\nReflecting the tightness, the premium on Brent contracts for loading in one month over contracts for loadings in six months, a metric closely watched by traders, hit a record high at $11.55 a barrel.\n\nAnalysts said Brent was likely to remain above $100 a barrel until significant alternative supplies become available from US shale or Iran, for example.\n\nThe United States and Iran have been engaged in indirect nuclear talks in Vienna that could lead to the removal of sanctions on Iranian oil sales.\n\nAnalysts are warning of inflationary pressure on the global economy from $100 oil, especially for Asia, which imports most of its energy needs.\n\n\u201cAsia\u2019s Achilles heel remains its vast import needs for energy, with surging oil prices bound to take a hefty bite out of income and growth over the coming year,\u201d said HSBC economist Frederic Neumann.\n\nHouse Seeks Immediate Evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine\n\nAs the conflict worsens, the House of Representatives has directed its leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa, and Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Hon. Yakub Buba, to liaise with the Foreign Affairs Ministry, National Intelligence Agency, and Ukrainian embassy to see that Nigerian students in Ukraine were immediately evacuated.\n\nMoving a motion of urgent national importance at the plenary yesterday, Hon. Ahmed Munir lamented that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was deteriorating by the hour.\n\nMunir pointed out that Nigeria had a significant number of undergraduate and graduate students currently studying in Ukraine, with a good number of them under government scholarships. This, he said, included a number of Nigerian diplomats and their families in the Kiev Embassy and Nigerian expatriates across Ukraine.\n\nHe expressed concern that if a strategic plan was not put in place to secure and provide safe passage for Nigerian citizens, they may be trapped or worse, harmed.\n\nThe lawmaker urged his colleagues to mandate its Committees on Foreign Affairs and diaspora, in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to ascertain the exact figures of Nigerians affected by this conflict and put in place a comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and evaluation mechanism.\n\nContributing, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, amended the prayer calling for an interface with the ministry, NIA and embassy for immediate evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine.\n\nGbajabiamila said since a state of emergency had been declared on the conflict, urgent action needed to be taken to ensure safety of the citizens.\n\nThe Speaker told the lawmakers that if nothing positive came out of their meeting with the stakeholders today, then they should immediately contact the chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, regardless of the cost and head to Ukraine tomorrow (Friday) and evacuate the students on Monday.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cThis is a very important motion that we discussed. Time is of the essence. A state of emergency has been declared, I listened to the news yesterday, even America said it\u2019s not going to be bloodless. We should be more proactive and I think it\u2019s better late than never. It\u2019s important that at this point to forget all the bureaucratic bottlenecks, and look out for our citizens, especially students.\n\n\u201cAction needs to be taken now and my thought is that leader of the House Hon. Ado Doguwa, and Chairman, Foreign Affairs, Hon. Buba Yakub, should liaise with the ministry foreign affairs, NIA and embassy in Ukraine and if nothing positive comes out of it, then we should liaise with chairman Air Peace. Whatever it\u2019s going to cost the House, you need to leave this country latest tomorrow and come back on Monday with many of our students.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Kenyan influencers were paid $10 to $15 to discredit controversial bills on Twitter",
          "text": "In the past 3 years, the Kenyan parliament has discussed two pieces of health legislation that has sparked online debates. The bills are the Reproductive Healthcare Bill and the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, also known as the Surrogacy Bill.\n\nAccording to a new report by Mozilla Foundation, Kenyans\u2019 conversations on Twitter on these health bills have been manipulated by disinformation campaigns sponsored by an anti-choice Spanish advocacy group, CitizenGO. The report shows that CitizenGO, a group that has been linked to the Spanish far-right, by exploiting the Twitter Trends algorithm, was able to input itself in these conversations in an attempt to influence debates around health bills.\n\nAccording to briefs seen by the researchers of the report, the messages the campaign used to attack activists contained cartoon caricatures and memes that echo messaging by American and European right-wing groups.\n\nThe Reproductive Healthcare Bill was introduced to the parliament in 2020 and is supposed to outlaw forced sterilisations; make prenatal, delivery and postnatal services free and provide rights to reproductive healthcare services to every woman in Kenya, including adolescents. In 2021, the Surrogacy Bill proposed Kenyan politicians should develop standards and regulations around surrogacy\u2014an arrangement where a woman (a surrogate mother) carries a child in her belly on behalf of another woman, who receives the child after birth.\n\nOdanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation based in Nairobi, reviewed content posted between 2019 and 2021 and discovered that CitizenGo, and accounts linked to it, had tweeted 20,811 times and engaged in 11 campaigns\u2014when a large number of accounts tweeting using a predetermined hashtag or keyword. 10 of these problematic campaigns made it to the Trend section.\n\nThe Mozilla report reveals that CitizenGO paid the owner of these accounts or \u201cdisinformation influencers\u201d around $10 to $15 to make tailored tweets that discredited the bills.\n\nThe campaign made multiple false and misleading claims about surrogacy and reproductive health. For example, a tweet in the campaign claimed that children of surrogates display behavioural and emotional issues\u2014a claim the report revealed the African Population Health Research Center (APHRC) had debunked. Those tweets went on to attack journalists, activists and politicians that advocated for reproductive rights or the two reproductive bills.\n\nIn response to this report, Twitter has permanently suspended 240 accounts connected to this disinformation campaign for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.\n\nA booming disinformation industry\n\nLast year, Madung and Brian Obilo, another Mozilla fellow, discovered, through a series of interviews with social media influencers who coordinated disinformation attacks, were responsible for spreading the hashtag #AnarchistJudges. The tweets under this hashtag, which trended countrywide, cast suspicion on the competence and integrity of court officials that were against the Constitutional Amendments Bill of 2021 in Kenya.\n\nLike this campaign, it was also coordinated through WhatsApp and social media influencers were paid between 10$ to 15$ per campaign to tweet predetermined malicious tweets.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation report noted that the campaign had all the patterns of a disinformation campaign: heavy repetition of content under hashtags, newly created accounts tweeting political content, synchronised posting period and false tweets.\n\nHeightening Twitter Trend\u2019s criticism\n\nTwitter\u2019s Trends section helps users identify the most discussed topics on the platform and also help them find popular information or discussion. They vary depending on geographical location and personal interest.\n\nBut the feature has come under fire multiple times over the years for spreading hate and disinformation, and at some point, external critics and Twitter employees suggested eradicating the feature altogether, after it struggled to deal with disinformation around the US presidential election. One of Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up the feature was by adding more context to trending topics.\n\nMadung expressed concerns about the potential influence of these disinformation actors in the upcoming Kenya election: \u201cHealth is a political issue & more so reproductive health. As we mentioned in the report, there\u2019s clear evidence that these groups will be looking to exert their influence on candidates and citizens to ultimately affect the ballot in favour of candidates that agree with them.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended that Twitter should assess individual countries and map out how the Trends section can be used to push disinformation; establish collaborations with local researchers, and develop a transparent partnership with fact-checkers and civil societies, all of whom can offer context about the region. Last year, Twitter was forced to disable the Trends feature in Ethiopia as it was increasingly used to push by warring parties to spread hate campaigns. By the way, researchers could not find any tangible impact of this intervention on the subsequent volume of hate speech on the platform.\n\nLast year, a Buzzfeed investigation revealed that Nigerian influencers paid to tweet in a coordinated manner successfully manipulated Twitter Trends in order to sway public opinion and court judgement in favour of Venezuelan politician, Alex Saab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to manipulate (content) in jurisdictions such as ours where the volume of content is not as high as countries such as the US,\u201d Madung tells TechCabal. With African countries increasingly vulnerable to disinformation actors on Twitter, a collaborative effort between Twitter, policymakers, civil societies and media organisations will be crucial to keep online discourse saner and difficult to manipulate.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s 5G race: MTN and Mafab pay $547.2m licence fee",
          "text": "Today, February 24 2022, marks a milestone in the race for Nigeria\u2019s 5th generation (5G) mobile network spectrum. The winners of the bid for 3.5GHz 5G spectrum, MTN and Mafab have each completed payment of the $273.6m licence fee required by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nAside the $273.6 million payment, MTN paid additional $15.9 million, being the bidding sum it offered at the assignment state of the spectrum auction, making it clinch its preferred Lot 1 (3500-3600 Megahertz-MHz) in the 3.5Ghz spectrum; while, Mafab Communications, which bided lower at the assignment stage, consequentially settled with Lot 2 (3700-3800Mhz) at no extra cost.\n\n\u201cI wish to officially announce that NCC has received and confirmed payments from MTN and Mafab for their acquisition of 1 slot of 100Mhz each in the 3.5Ghz spectrum auction, which was successfully conducted by the Commission on December 13, 2021, \u201d Umar Danbatta Executive Vice Chairman, NCC said. \u201cThey both met the deadline of February 24, 2022 as set by the Commission.\u201d\n\nMafab emerges winner\n\nOn December 13, 2021, when the NCC announced that the MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications were the winners of the bid for the 5G licence, it came as a surprise to many as Mafab is an unknown player in the telecommunications space.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Transparency Nigeria Group petitioned the Federal Government and all relevant security agencies to launch an investigation into the business practices of Mafab Communications Limited.\n\n\u201cMafab Communications was incorporated in 2020, has no comprehensive tax history, and appears to have been specifically set up by connected insiders for the purpose of acquiring one of the highly valued 5G licences,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nHow MTN and Mafab won\n\nThe top bidders were Airtel Networks Limited, Mafab Communications Limited and MTN Communications Nigeria Limited, with the bidding price starting at $199,374,000. After 11 rounds of auction over a duration of 9 hours, the bid price rose to over $200 million with all 3 companies still active.\n\nThe auction process came to an end when MTN and Mafab posted an exit bid of $273 million, while Airtel posted a final bid of $270 million. Simply put, Airtel offered to pay the least amount among the three companies for the 5G licence, thus falling out of the race.\n\nPrior to the auction, Airtel, MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications had paid an initial non-refundable 10% deposit of $19.75m each, which was statutory and mandatory to qualify them to participate in the bid process.\n\nThere were also allegations put out that Mafab is connected to former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, but the NCC has denied the allegations.\n\nThe NCC also added to its claims that the auction was free and fair by pointing out that it had earlier awarded Mafab with international data access (IDA), inter-connect data exchange (IDE) and Value-Added Service (VAS) licences. The earliest licence being the IDA issued in October 2020, 4 months after Mafab was incorporated.\n\nMafab Communications Limited was registered on July 8, 2020, according to the company\u2019s website and TechCabal\u2019s search on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) site. It claims to provide and operate local Interconnect and International carrier services; there\u2019s no information about clients on its website.\n\nThe company is led by Musbahu Muhammad Bashir, the chairman of the Althani Group, an Abuja-based holdco that oversees a group of companies, including Eman Homes & Estate, Althani Investment Limited, Salam Takaful Insurance, and Mafab Communications.\n\nDeployment Phase\n\nAfter payment of the licence fee, the next phase for the bid winners is to deploy the 5G network service across Nigeria. According to the Information Memorandum of the 3.5GHz spectrum licence, the licencees have a rollout obligation plan spanning a period of 10 years, beginning from the date the license is award. Between the first and second year of the licence, the operators are expected to roll out the service in, at least, one state in each geo-political zone.\n\nFrom the third to fifth year, they are obligated to cover all the zones. Between 6 to 10 years, they should cover all the states in the country, according to guidelines set out in the Information Memorandum.\n\nRight of Way and energy costs\n\nAt the deployment phase, the two operators will have to deal with the Right of Way (RoW) fees of different Nigerian states. In 2020, the Nigerian government tried to get different states to reduce their RoW charges for fibre cables and adopt the agreed \u20a6145 per linear metre signed by the National Executive Council.\n\nBut only 7 states agreed to this while 29 states stuck to their guns\u2014states like Benue, Ogun and Lagos charge \u20a62,500, \u20a64,000, \u20a6750 per linear metre. The argument of the 29 states is that RoW is a source of revenue for their governments, but the big picture is that if any of these states reduce the fees, they may attract significant broadband investment from telcos.\n\nTelecom operators also have to contend with the heavy power demand of the 5G network infrastructure. Due to Nigeria\u2019s insufficient power system, telecom operators in the country have to generate and distribute the power they use.\n\nThese are some of the obstacles MTN and Mafab will have to surmount along the journey to deploying 5G network in Nigeria.\n\nWhy 5G matters\n\nThe advent of 5G comes with significant advantages, one of which is higher bandwidths. This translates to the ability to transfer large volumes of data at extremely high speed and very low latency. Simply put, 5G is faster than previous generations of mobile networks. It can, for instance, transfer data at 10 gigabits per second\u2014up to 100 times faster than 4G.\n\nThe increase in data transmission speed is important because new technologies and revolutionary innovations such as driverless cars and remote classrooms require faster connectivity and reduced latency to function optimally.\n\n5G networks are expected to make an estimated contribution of $13.2 trillion in economic value globally according to a recent WEF report. It\u2019s also expected to generate 22.3 million jobs from direct network investments and residual services.\n\nThe race to deploy 5G in Nigeria is still on, as MTN and Mafab head into the deployment phase.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "What Flutterwave\u2019s fintech as a service means for the African tech ecosystem",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after announcing its Series D round that sent its valuation over the $3 billion mark, African fintech startup, Flutterwave, at a virtual event, announced additional services to its existing offering. In addition to its payment infrastructure, the startup unveiled the addition of Apple and Google Pay, Grow (its SME financing service), and fintech as a service (FaaS).\n\nStartups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure. The announcement is the first of its kind in Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem, and this article provides some insight into the implications for African startups.\n\nWhat is fintech as a service?\n\nAkurateco, a Dutch software provider, defines fintech as a service as offering financial technology as a service. Startups that provide FaaS often provide an API that enables other startups or institutions to provide various financial services, including payments, wallet provision, and card issuance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the technology provider is completely responsible for developing and maintaining its platform, while the startups it serves focus on providing unique services for their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave founder and CEO, Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAfrican API fintech startups have gained more attention in recent years, but they often focus on a few services. While startups like Mono and Okra concentrate on providing financial data and payment APIs, Flutterwave intends to provide an API that meets all of a business\u2019 financial needs.\n\nIn Flutterwave\u2019s case, a grocery delivery startup, for instance, that signs up to use its FaaS API can choose a custom offer that enables it to provide a wallet and payment option for its customers while it focuses on aggregating meal choices for its customers.\n\nHow does FaaS affect the ecosystem?\n\nIn a statement explaining why B Capital invested in Flutterwave\u2019s Series D round, Matt Levinson, a partner at the firm, said, \u201cFlutterwave may ultimately build one of the most consequential fintech businesses in the world, enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to transact online and connect Africa to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy including fintech as a service in its offerings, Flutterwave is definitely on the path to doing that, but how does this affect other startups in Africa?\n\nImproved customer service\n\nCustomers are usually the biggest beneficiaries when businesses make changes to their business model, which could well be the case. By enabling other companies to integrate financial services to existing offerings, they allow the businesses to expand already existing offers.\n\nAll things considered, this should enable them to focus on their core business, providing customers with a better experience and increasing competition among startups.\n\nFaster time to market\n\nThe time needed to add a new feature to a startup could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, but with fintech as a service, a startup could launch a new feature in as little as days. This cuts down their time to market and allows them to receive feedback faster.\n\nHowever, the tech is not all they stand to benefit from. Providing financial services often means that businesses deal with customers\u2019 data. Consequently, regulators often have to step in to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntegrating Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS API will help them bypass most regulatory requirements. Yet, while it allows them to get to market faster, it also reduces the startup\u2019s ability to innovate and could reduce the quality of its services.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAn individual\u2019s financial data could be used to exploit the person, and that explains why the fintech industry is probably the most regulated sector in Nigeria. Providing a FaaS API is not limited to fintech companies, with other industries capable of integrating with them.\n\nOutsourcing the provision of their fintech services could, therefore, leave startups at the mercy of the service provider as they often lose control over the quality and security of their fintech service.\n\nAccording to Jan Chapman, Co-founder and Managing Director of MSP Blueshift, \u201cwhen a startup outsources its fintech services, it is often required to share sensitive data with its service provider. This can put the startup\u2019s data at risk and expose it to fraud or identity theft. The startup may also be limited in its ability to control how its data is used and may not have the same level of security as it would if it developed its fintech platform.\u201d\n\nIncreased regulatory oversights\n\nProviding FaaS services to startups would see Flutterwave dealing with data from the businesses that sign up and could open it up to increased regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely possibilities of more regulatory oversights in niche cases, especially if it involves private data, but generally, standardisation and provision of FaaS through APIs means that there is more compliance built right from the go,\u201d says Rafiq Lightwala, Founder of Investify, a Pakistani fintech startup.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS offering is a welcome development for startups that may need to ride on its infrastructure, it could also throw up quality control, regulatory, and security issues. However, going by some of its appointments in the past year, the startup seems prepared for problems that may arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRussian military activity in eastern Ukraine has increased recently, with threats of a larger invasion looming. Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, has unequivocally stated that Ukraine has no historical claim to independence; on Monday, February 21, 2022, he said that modern Ukraine was \u201centirely created by Russia.\u201d\n\nAnd on Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, potentially igniting a European war over Russia\u2019s demands for an end to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) eastward expansion.\n\nBut what could have caused the conflict? While tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, had existed for some time, the situation began to spiral out of control in early 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged US president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to join NATO in January of last year. This infuriated Russia, which began sending troops near its Ukrainian border for \u201ctraining exercises\u201d and increased the number of troops sent in 2021.\n\nSadly, 14,000 people have died in Ukraine since 2014; I\u2019m sure many more will perish if caution is not exercised. Plus, I think this conflict has the potential to spark World War III. Do you think so? Leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) data protection laws have long been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d globally. Nonetheless, because technology has changed our lives in ways no one could have predicted in the last 25 years, the rules must be rewritten.\n\nThe EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, one of its most significant achievements in recent years. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, enacted when the Internet was in its infancy.\n\nAnd over the last four years, some progress has been made in protecting personal data since the GDPR was implemented.\n\nLarge technology companies have come under intense scrutiny. Due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing, they have had to backtrack and seek ways to protect user privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, Facebook and Google are under increasing pressure to better balance privacy and ad targeting, with their fortunes on the line as users revolt, regulators loom, and Apple seizes the opportunity to improve its image.\n\nPer Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free as of December 2021; that figure is 94% on the Apple App Store.\n\nBut is Apple more secure than Google in terms of privacy?\n\nResearch shows that an iPhone or an Android device constantly sends data to Apple or Google, including your location, phone number, and local network details.\n\nSo, how do Google and Apple strike a balance between privacy concerns and profit motives? In the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo covered and provided more insight into this.\n\nPlease read the article here, The Google/Apple dilemma: Balancing the pain points of privacy and profit\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022, and explosions have been reported in the country\u2019s east.\n\nWhy should you care? The cryptocurrency market has fallen sharply as the war in Ukraine escalated, with missiles continuing to pour down on the country\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and its airport being captured by airborne troops.\n\nThe missile reports have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, causing a selling hysteria that has resulted in a loss of nearly $500 million in liquidations for the entire crypto market as of the time of writing.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, $462.91 million in cryptocurrency has been \u2018rekt\u2019 \u2013 financially lost \u2013 since two nights ago, Wednesday, February 23, 2022. Also, the crypto market is down more than 10%, as many altcoins have suffered significant losses.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order occurred on Bitfinex, where LINK \u2013 an Ethereum token \u2013 worth $3.21 million was liquidated. During the sell-off, Bitcoin and Ethereum lost $129.95 million and $116.68 million, respectively.\n\nRecall that the flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Russia\u2019s stock markets experienced a \u201cbloodbath\u201d at the start of the trading session on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe crash occurred as investors reacted to Western governments\u2019 promised sanctions in response to Putin\u2019s shocking announcement that Russia had launched military action against Ukraine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow Do We Take Care of Our Mental Health at Work?

If that file exists, then vistors will see the message Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.\n\nTo stop that message from being displayed to vistors, just delete the .maintenance file. The automatic upgrade should be executed again, just in case it failed.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhen an update is released, notification of that release is displayed at the top administration screens saying WordPress x.x.x is available! Please update now. Not every blog will see that message at the same time. Your blog is programmed to check for updates every 12 hours, but the timing of that check is purely random. So if your blog just checked for updates minutes before an update was released, you won\u2019t see the update message until your blog checks for updates 12 hours later.\n\nIf you want your blog to check right now for updates, you can delete the update_core option name record in your wp_options table. Note that plugins and themes each have their own check and update cycle, controlled by the records update_plugins and update_themes, in wp_options.\n\nRelevant discussion thread:\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade? # Why did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade?\n\nA core upgrade copies all the new files from the distribution over the old ones, so if you changed existing files in the WordPress default theme (e.g. wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/style.css), those changes got overwritten with the new version of that file.\n\nPlease note, a core upgrade goes through a list of \u201cold files\u201d, as defined in wp-admin/includes/update-core.php, and deletes those files. Any files not on the list, and not in the distribution, are preserved.\n\nRemember, that before upgrades, whether automatic or manual, both the WordPress Files and database should be backed-up as explained in WordPress Backups.\n\nA better way to modify the default theme is by using a child theme. It\u2019s a little more work to set up, but worth the effort because your customizations will be safe when the main theme is updated.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do you repair a MySQL database table? # How do you repair a MySQL database table?\n\nEvery once in a while, it may be necessary to repair one or more MySQL database tables. According to the How to Repair MyISAM Tables at dev.mysql.com there are a number of reasons to repair a table including errors such as \u201ctbl_name.frm is locked against change\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t find file tbl_name.MYI (Errcode: nnn)\u201d, \u201cUnexpected end of file\u201d, \u201cRecord file is crashed\u201d, or \u201cGot error nnn from table handler\u201d.\n\nHere are the steps to repair a table in a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin:\n\nLogin to hosting account. Login to phpMyAdmin. Choose the affected database. If you only have one database, it should choose it by default so you don\u2019t need to do anything. In the main panel, you should see a list of your database tables. Check the boxes by the tables that need repair. At the bottom of the window just below the list of tables, there is a drop down menu. Choose \u201cRepair Table\u201d\n\nRemember, that it is advisable to have a current backup of your database at all times. See also WordPress Backups\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do I empty a database table? # How do I empty a database table?\n\nRefer Emptying a Database Table\n\nTop \u2191\n\nEmailed passwords are not being received # Emailed passwords are not being received\n\nDescription: When users try to register with your blog or change their passwords by entering their username and/or email, WordPress indicates that their password has been emailed to them, but it is never received.\n\nReason and Solutions: WordPress uses the standard PHP mail() function, which uses sendmail. No account information is needed. This is not generally a problem if you are using a hosting service, but if you are using your own box and do not have an SMTP server, the mail will never send. If you are using a *NIX box, you should have either postfix or sendmail on your machine; you will just need to set them up (search the Internet for how-to\u2019s). If you do not want to go through setting up a complete mail server on your *NIX box you may find msmtp useful \u2014 it provides \u201cA secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail hub\u201d. On a Windows machine, try a sendmail emulator like Glob SendMail.\n\nMore help can be found on this thread of the WordPress Support Forums: https://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=24981.\n\nWindows Host Server Specific: Check your \u201cRelay\u201d settings on the SMTP Virtual Server. Grant access to 127.0.0.1 . Then in your php.inifile, set the SMTP setting to the same IP address. Also set smtp_port to 25 .\n\nEnsure Proper Return Address is Used: By default, the WordPress mailer fills in the From: field with wordpress@yourdomain.com and the From: name as WordPress.\n\nThis is fine if this is a valid e-mail address. For example, if your real e-mail is wordpress@yourdomain.com, your host should pass the email on for delivery. It will probably send your mail as long as yourdomain.com is setup to send and receive mail, even if wordpress is not a valid mail box. But if you set you real email as the From: address and it\u2019s something like wpgod@gmail.com, the mail may not send because gmail.com is not a domain handled by the mail server.\n\nTreated as Spam: Your email message may have been routed to a spam folder or even worse, simply discarded as malicious. There are a couple measures you can use to convince recipient\u2019s mail servers that your message is legitimate and should be delivered as addressed.\n\nSPF: (Sender Policy Framework) This is the most common anti-spam measure used. If you are on a hosted system, there is a good chance your host has set this up for the mail server you are using. Have WordPress email you and check the message headers for evidence that the message passed the SPF check. You can get a message sent by following the Forgot Password link on the login page. To keep your old password, do not follow the link in the message.\n\nIf your system email failed the SPF check, you can set up the credentials if you have access to your DNS records and your mail server\u2019s domain belongs to you. Check the return path of the email your system sent. If the mail server listed there has your domain name, you can set up SPF credentials. There are several how-tos on the Internet.\n\nDKIM: (Domain Key Identified Mail) This system is also used. You can use both SPF and DKIM in the same message. Again, just as with SPF, you can check if your receiving mailserver verified your host\u2019s domain key by examining the mail header. There is a fair chance no signature key was provided, indicating your host chose to not use this protocol. Also as with SPF, if you can edit your DNS records and the mail server belongs to your domain, you can set up DKIM credentials yourself. Some how-tos exist if you search the Internet.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria? # Why can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria?\n\nClearing your browser cache and cookies may resolve this problem. See also I Make Changes and Nothing Happens\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem? # How do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem?\n\nDescription: You get a warning message on your browser that says:\n\nWarning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at\n\nReason and Solution:\n\nIt is usually because there are spaces, new lines, or other stuff before an opening <?php tag or after a closing ?> tag, typically in wp-config.php. This could be true about some other file too, so please check the error message, as it will list the specific file name where the error occurred (see \u201cInterpreting the Error Message\u201d below). Replacing the faulty file with one from your most recent backup or one from a fresh WordPress download is your best bet, but if neither of those are an option, please follow the steps below.\n\nJust because you cannot see anything does not mean that PHP sees the same.\n\nDownload the file mentioned in the error message via FTP or the file manager provided in your host\u2019s control panel. Open that file in a plain text editor (NOT Microsoft Word or similar. Notepad or BBEdit are fine). Check that the very first characters are with no blank lines or spaces after it. Before saving, or use the Save as dialog, ensure the file encoding is not UTF-8 BOM but plain UTF-8 or any without the BOM suffix.\n\nTo be sure about the end of the file, do this:\n\nPlace the cursor between the ? and > Now press the DELETE key on your computer Note to MAC users: The \u201cDELETE\u201d key on a PC deletes characters to the right of the cursor. That is the key noted here. Keep that key pressed For at least 15 seconds Now type > and save without pressing any other key at all. If you press another key, you will bring the problem back. DO NOT PUT CODE IN UNNECESSARY CODE BLOCKS, PUT THEM IN A SINGLE PHP BLOCK.\n\nWrong:\n\n<?php some code; ?> <?php some other codes; ?>\n\nCorrect:\n\n<?php code; some other code; ?>\n\nUpload the file back to your server after editing and saving the file.\n\nNote: Also check the encoding of the file. If the file is encoded as UTF-8 with BOM, the BOM is seen as a character which starts the output.\n\nInterpreting the Error Message:\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/blog/wp-config.php:34) in /path/blog/wp-login.php on line 42 , then the problem is at line #34 of wp-config.php , not line #42 of wp-login.php . In this scenario, line #42 of wp-login.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #34 of wp-config.php .\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/wp-admin/admin-header.php:8) in /path/wp-admin/post.php on line 569 , then the problem is at line #8 of admin-header.php , not line #569 of post.php . In this scenario, line #569 of post.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #8 of admin-header.php .\n\nTop \u2191\n\nTo resolve this and similar issues, disable your plugins one at a time until you find the source of the issue. Generally, this will be due to two or more plugins trying to use the same resources (for example, JQuery or other Java-based tools).\n\nIn addition, it could be that there is a problem with your browser. A common resolution is to empty the browser\u2019s cache. Please consult the documentation for your preferred browser to learn how to do this.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nIf an error 404 occurs when using the Pretty Permalink choices such as Day and Name in Administration > Settings > Settings_Permalinks_Screen it could be a result of the mod_rewrite module not being activated/installed. The solution is to activate mod_rewrite for the Apache web-server. Check the apache\\conf\\httpd.conf file for the line # LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n\nand delete the # in front of the line. Then stop Apache and start it again. Note: you may have to ask your host to activate mod_rewrite.\n\nSee also Using Permalinks.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 Members of the All Nations For Christ Bible Institute International Alumni Association have announced plans to hold a mega conference that will bring together men and women who were raised by the late Archbishop.\n\nThe conference tagged \u2018Sons of Benson Idahosa Conference (SOBIC) is scheduled to hold in September later this year and will be a convergence of every man and woman whose life has been impacted directly or indirectly by the Archbishop Benson Idahosa of blessed memory.\n\nThis was made known at the inauguration of the Alumni by the President of the Church of God Mission International Archbishop Margaret Benson-Idahosa on Sunday in Benin City.\n\nVice Chairman of the Alumni association Bishop Dr. Robertson Akwazi while speaking at the occasion disclosed that the Man Archbishop Benson Idahosa\u2019s life and time is one that will continue to serve as a point of reference in the Church, not just in Nigeria but the world all over.\n\nBishop Akwazi also known as AA Global said, it would be unimaginable just how many great men and women of God today will show up for the event which coincides with the week of his birthday.\n\n\u201cWe decided that since we are the Idahosas that you can see not only in Nigeria, but in Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, South Africa and the World all over, now is the time to cause his voice to be heard once again throughout the Land. He said the Archbishop Dr Margaret Idahosa has given the alumni a fresh mandate, to raise men, women and leaders who will impact not just on the Church but the society for good. \u201d\n\nApostle Joshua Olaoye in his remarks, highlighted the fact that the Bible Institute had birthed well over 15,000 leaders spread across the globe, stating that the Alumni Association was one that has come in good time. The essence of its validation by the Archbishop Margaret Benson-Idahosa he said was one that cannot be overestimated.\n\nAnother member of the AA Governing Body, Bishop Chris Otaigbe said \u201dThe Sons of Idahosa Conference is kick-starting a movement and it will be a yearly event. The conference will shake the Nation for good. Amongst the Sons of Benson Idahosa, we have Papa Ayo Oritsejafor, our immediate past PFN Chairman, Pa Felix Omobude, Archbishop Nicolas Duncan Williams, we are bringing everybody together to cause his voice to be heard once again as we converge. If the man Benson Idahosa were here with us , a lot of the manifestations in our midst today would not have happened. \u201d\n\n\u201dThe Provost of the School Dr. Habib Usman, added saying \u201d I believe in historical legacies, and Idahosa being a foundation Apostle, he set the platform for everyone to run through. And in terms of the school graduating 15,00 students, that is not a mean number. And saying this covers all seven continents of the world, is not an assumption, its a reality, because we have seen students from Australia, from India, currently we have students from America studying with us. We have seen students from all 32 countries in Africa come to study with us here in Benin city.\n\n\u201cSo the impact that All Nations has made in the sphere of Christianity, not just Pentecostalism, is not something that can be scribbled down with an academic pen. It is beyond our explanation. Those of us in our 40s and 50s will recall the proverbial saying \u2018As poor as a church rat\u2019, Those were the days when the Church was designated to be meant for poor people. With Archbishop Benson Idahosa coming into the center stage of Christianity, that expression no longer exists. It is noteworthy here to state that the introduction of prosperity doctrine to the church was necessitated by the fact that Nigeria just came out from civil war because we know that Nigeria was in civil war when the church started. And Papa Idahosa was able to tell the church that we can come out of that poverty, and the rest is what you and I are able to attest to.\n\nThe Sons of Benson Idahosa Conference (SOBIC) 2022 is scheduled to come up in September later this year. And is expected to attract participants from within and outside Nigeria. Guest Speakers expected at the three-day event include Archbishop Ayo Oritsejafor, Archbishop Duncan Williams from Ghana, Archbishop David Oyedepo, and a host of great men and women of God spread across the globe.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Electoral Act: Buhari Asks NASS to amend section stopping appointees from contesting elections",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has asked the National Assembly to amend the section of the Electoral Act which bars political appointees from electoral contest.\n\nBuhari made the demand while signing the bill at the presidential villa in Abuja on Friday.\n\nSection 84 (12) of the bill makes it mandatory for political appointees who want to run for office in 2023 to resign.\n\nWhile signing the bill into law, Buhari said section 84(12) of the act contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote, or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions. Section 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election.\n\n\u201cThe practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "West Africa\u2019s leading airline, Air Peace has said it did not disrespect the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero.\n\nThe airline said this while responding to a letter of complaint written by a cousin to the Emir, Prince Isa Bayero.\n\nThe Emir\u2019s cousin had asked the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to take punitive actions against the airline over what he called \u201cdisrespect\u201d to the Emir and people of Kano.\n\nPrince Bayero was said to have called the Air Peace Chairman, Mr. Allen Onyema to delay the airline\u2019s morning flight to Kano because their flight from Banjul, the Gambia, was delayed which prevented them from arriving on time to the airport.\n\nBut, Chief Operating Officer, Air Peace Ltd, Toyin Olajide (Mrs) in a statement expressed shock over what she called the deliberate falsehood against the airline, insisting that the Airline holds the Emir in the highest regards.\n\nAccording to the Air Peace, contrary to the insinuation that the Emir was disrespected, the Airline even protected the image of the Emir.\n\nAccording to Olajide, \u201cRather than disrespect the revered Emir of Kano, Air Peace did everything to protect the name and image of the Emir from ridicule by not succumbing to what Isa Bayero wanted us to do.\n\n\u201cIf we had agreed to stop and delay an aircraft, already set to take-off, for another one hour only for the doors to be opened and the Emir to walk in, there would have been a very serious uproar in the media nationwide against both the airline and the Emir. This we pleaded with Isa Bayero to understand but he refused to accept.\n\n\u201cHow could Isa Bayero want the Management of Air Peace to stop and delay a fully boarded plane with doors already shut and aircraft already moving while our respected Emir and eight others in his entourage, including Isa Bayero, were still at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos after arriving from Banjul?\u201d\n\nThe COO explained that from the telephone log evidence on the phone of the Chairman/CEO, Allen Onyema, Mr. Isa Bayero, called at about 5.52am, at a time he was still sleeping.\n\nShe said from the same log, it could be seen that he called him again at 5.59am which obviously woke him up.\n\nThe COO added, \u201cOn seeing that it was Isa Bayero calling, he took the call. Isa told our Chairman that he and the Emir of Kano had just landed the Murtala Mohammed International Airport Lagos from Banjul, Gambia and would be proceeding to Kano same morning.\n\n\u201cHe told the Chairman to delay our first flight of the day, the 6:15 am Lagos-Kano flight for him and the Emir with another eight persons. It was not true that our Chairman refused flatly. He rather told Mr. Isa Bayero to give him a few minutes to call the airport to find out the status of the flight. I was the one he called. To show his desire to help, he called me immediately and intimated me with the request.\n\n\u201cI am the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Air Peace. I quickly called the local airport from where we carry on our day to day domestic flight operations and was told that the aircraft had since finished boarding and was almost taxiing out.\u201d",

This is the only serious party in the country, all others are contraptions. Under PDP, we saw development and unity but now, there is no development. I want to see the unity of PDP leaders on the Plateau because this is home. If they are not united, if I have a problem, where will I go?\n\n\u201cI want everyone to work together and bring back all our members who were angry and left PDP. Plateau is the home of PDP, we must work together to return to power and save the country. I don\u2019t want Plateau to be in opposition when we win the election at the federal.

          "text": "By Nehru Odeh\n\nWhen popular spoken word and performance artist Dike Chukwumerije published his poem, Fix the Politics, in 2020, it was borne out of his desire to inspire Nigerians to take active part in politics and choose who governs them in order to create social change.\n\n\u201cUntil they are there in the highest Office/ Men and women with a heart for selfless service/ No region, no religion \u2013 just commitment to Nation\u2026/Until we elect them, we labour in vain,\u201d the poem concludes.\n\nHowever two years on, Kininso Koncepts Production, a creative/cultural hub has adapted it into a movie entitled Fix Politics. And this is indeed timely as the nation is just few months away from the 2023 General elections.\n\nThe film, produced with the support of the Centre for Information Technology and Development and the MacArthur Foundation was screened on Friday via Zoom before a selected audience as part of preview session before its formal release.\n\nFix Politics, which interrogates bad governance and dirty politics such as corruption, tribalism and nepotism and other issues and inspires Nigerians to participate in politics in order to make a change. It features seasoned actors and veterans such as Bimbo Manuel, Jude Chukwuka, Ede Paul Azino, Segun Adefila as well as Nollywood fresh and finest cinema faces such as Sambasa Nzeribe, Caroline Igben, Tope Okowoniyan, Emmanuel Anya, Olasunkanmi Adebayo, Nnamdi Agbo, Precious Eminue and popular Instagram comedian, Eriaka Edgar.\n\nAccording to a statement by Kinonso Koncepts Production Nigeria, Nigeria is at its electioneering season and as a timely project, Fix Politics aims to sensitize and create awareness for the citizens, particularly the youth and the government on the part they must play as stakeholders to curbing these issues and we must start now.\n\nWhen TheNEWS asked the director of the film Joshua Alabi what the movie is about, he said: \u201cThe film is actually an original poem written by Dike Chukwumerije and it basically talks about tribalism, corruption, bad governance and what we do about our nonchalant attitude towards issues of governance and politics. It also talks about the issues of politicians in office who do nothing but sit there making money, publishing white papers and riding expensive SUVs.\n\n\u201cWe are just asking on a general note that since 2023 is just a few months from now, are you prepared to take on these responsibilities? What do we want to do? Do we want to run away from this country? Or some of us want to stay and do something at the grassroots? We all can\u2019t be presidents or governors. So what do you intend to do? What is your role? Or what do you think is your role?\u201d Alabi said during the preview screening session.\n\nAlabi also said since the movie is geared towards conscientizing the citizens and raising their social awareness, it won\u2019t be restricted only to the cinemas.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be on the social media space. We can have it on our phones. It is not a film that is for the cinema. It is what we want everyone to be able to watch any time to remind themselves of the roles they need to play. It it works, the onus is on us. If it doesn\u2019t it is on us. We have our individual roles to play. It would be on WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube. It would be on every platform,\u201d he maintained.\n\nAt the preview screening session, the movie had a dramatic and poetic start as each of the cast took turns to recite parts of the poem, thus giving the audience insights into what they were about to watch.\n\nKininso Koncepts Production has in the past 10 years produced theatre and performance contents for corporate bodies and NGO/Chaos on major issues such as domestic violence, rape, insurgency, child trafficking, Justice and security, peace and reconciliation, health and safety, anti-corruption, malaria, human rights and gender equality. These works have served as catalyst for social orientation especially as it concerns Nigerians and youths.",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019ll usher in robust democracy, NASS \u2026It\u2019s historic \u2013 INEC, holds extraordinary meeting Saturday \u2026Buhari institutionalising credible elections in Nigeria \u2013 APC \u2026Action a death knell for APC \u2013 PDP \u2026Atiku, Saraki, Ekweremadu hails Buhari, NASS \u2026NBA thumbs up president, says it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Friday called on members of the National Assembly to immediately amend some sections of the Electoral Act 2022 that contravene the rights of political office holders to vote and be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nThe president made the call before assenting to the Electoral Act at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election.\n\nQuoting the Section, the president said, \u201c84(12) No political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election,\u201d the President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.\n\n\u201cThe practical application of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under sections 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension, as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it would not be right for the country\u2019s democratic processes to overstretch beyond constitutional limits.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restrictions into the constitution on account of practical application of Section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said the Electoral Act 2022 holds a lot of promise for improving the election processes in the country, with introduction of new technology and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.\n\n\u201cFrom the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11), among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting Section 84(12) accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe president commended members of the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe president said he received inputs from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the government, after careful and thorough reviews of the Bill and its implications to democratic processes, before signing The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 into law.\n\nINEC\u2019s declarations\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that it fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with the implementation of the newly signed 2022 Electoral Act in earnest.\n\nTo this end, the Commission has summoned an extraordinary meeting scheduled for today Saturday, February 26, 2022.\n\nA statement issued Friday by the National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education, Barrister Festus Okoye, described the assent as \u201chistoric,\u201d noting a statement would be issued on the way forward after the commission\u2019s extraordinary meeting.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cToday, Friday, February 25, 2022, the president of the Federal Republic Nigeria signed the Electoral Bill 2022 into law.\n\n\u201cThis is historic, being the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in 1999 that the Electoral Act is repealed and re-enacted. It contains many progressive provisions that will facilitate the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe nation now has the Electoral Act 2022 which replaces the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Together with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the new Act constitutes the principal law to govern the conduct of future elections, including the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cGiven the tight timelines contained in the new law, the Commission fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with their implementation in earnest.\n\n\u201cConsequently, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission is scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday, February 26, 2022. Thereafter, a statement will be issued on the way forward.\u201d\n\nNBA\u2019s commendations\n\nIn its reaction, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) lauded President Buhari for signing the Electoral Amendment Bill into Law.\n\nIts chairman, Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Dr. Onyekachi UbanI, gave the commendation Friday in Lagos, describing the assent as \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nUbani, however, said that assent to the bill came at the right time with the 2023 general elections underway.\n\n\u201cIt is a commendable step in the right direction, better late than never.\u201d\n\nSenate\u2019s promise\n\nReacting to the president\u2019s action, the Senate declared that it would expunge Section 84(12) that runs contrary to some provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nA statement issued by its spokesperson Friday, Senator Ajibola Basiru, read in part, \u201cThe Senate has taken notice of Section 84(12) of the Act, especially the concerns raised by Mr. President, and assured Nigerians that the National Assembly will give the Section the desired legislative attention.\u201d\n\nReps\u2019 take\n\nOn its part, the House of Representatives stated that signing of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into Law by President Buhari \u201cwill usher in a more robust democracy.\u201d\n\nIts spokesperson, Benjamin Kalu, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Friday in Abuja.\n\nKalu said signing the bill into law had opened various options of participation in politics, adding that there would be no room for excuses.\n\nAccording to him, this is a happy day for democracy in Nigeria; the ninth assembly has been a great voice to this achievement.\n\n\u201cWe have stood on the side of Nigerians to ensure that what was worth doing at all was worth doing well.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank the chairman of the National Assembly and the President of the Senate, Sen. Ahmed Lawal. We also thank the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\n\u201cThe two chambers have exhibited a lot of maturity in governance by not involving themselves in any ego trip, but by collaborating and cooperating with the executive.\n\n\u201cI am happy that finally, the president again, leaves a legacy that all of us will always remember. The president has done what was very difficult for many past administrations,\u201d Kalu said.\n\n\n\nAPC applauds\n\nApplauding President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law, the All progressives Congress (APC) described It as \u201ca big win for our electioneering processes and our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s national secretary, John James Akpanudoedehe, called on Nigerians to join the APC government \u201cto completely stamp out past practices of electoral fraud weaponised by past administrations of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\u201d\n\n\u201cSince 2015, when the President Buhari-led APC government came into being, our commitment and support for constitutionally-permitted innovations that will improve the transparency and credibility of Nigeria\u2019s electioneering processes and internal democracy, have not been in doubt. The new Electoral Act is another pointer.\n\n\u201cFrom legal backing given to election management bodies to review election results declared under duress, provisions for people with disabilities and special needs, electronic transmission of election results among other key provisions, current and coming generations will fondly remember President Buhari as the courageous leader who institutionalised credible elections and internal democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe note with appreciation the patriotic efforts of the National Assembly, civil societies, development partners and indeed all well-meaning Nigerians whose collective efforts and support has birthed the new Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe task of improving the credibility of our elections is a collective and continuous one. As a party and government, we will continue to champion needed reforms,\u2019 he said.\n\nPDP thumbs down\n\nDespite the avalanche of commendations from across the country, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the president\u2019s action as \u201ca death knell for the All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d\n\nThe party, in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, however, congratulated Nigerians, particularly civil society organisations, for fighting on its side in putting pressure on President Buhari to finally assent to the Bill.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe newly signed Electoral Act is a death knell for the All Progressives Congress (APC) which thrives in manipulations, ballot box snatching, ballot box stuffing and alteration of election results at the collation centers against the expressed Will of the people.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that President Buhari and the deflated APC has come to their wits end and bowed to the sustained pressure by the PDP and Nigerians for the entrenchment of processes that can guarantee free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe victory by Nigerians in resisting the APC and compelling President Buhari to sign the new Electoral Act clearly signposts the inevitable triumph of the will and aspiration of the people to kick out the APC through a process that ensures that votes cast at the polling units count.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu hails Buhari\n\nIn his reaction, a former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, has commended President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 into law, saying \u201cthe journey to the new Electoral Act was by far the most frustrating.\u201d\n\nHe said this in a post on his verified Facebook page titled, \u2018The New Electoral Act Is Progress For Our Democracy,\u2019 shared on Friday shortly after the president signed the Bill into law.\n\n\u201cAfter the major electoral reform of 2010 that also involved amendments to the 1999 Constitution to, among others, open the doors to technology in our electoral system, check some executive excesses, manipulations by political parties, and strengthen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) through financial and administrative autonomy, our expectation after amendments to the Electoral Act in 2015 was that the new administration would support the National Assembly to further straighten our electoral laws and system.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, four times, the amendments were turned down in the 8th National Assembly, apparently thwarted by narrow, partisan interests and ambitions.\n\n\u201cThe efforts in the current National Assembly also faced similar challenges, but it is heart-warming that it has finally materialised with the presidential assent.\n\n\u201cWith the electronic transmission of election results, early primary elections, and adequate time for INEC to prepare for elections, among other breakthroughs, our elections will never be the same again and more Nigerians will be encouraged to exercise their franchise, knowing that their votes will count.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s call\n\nAccording to former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, the Independent National Electoral Commission should roll out election guidelines ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to him, this will enable political parties to commence the process of choosing their leaders in 2023.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cNow that the legal framework for the 2023 elections is in place following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Electoral Bill, @inecnigeria needs to roll out the election guidelines in earnest so that the political parties and Nigerians can fully commence the journey to choose their leaders in 2023.\n\n\u201cI wish to acknowledge the work of the legislature in bringing this law with innovations into fruition. I also pay tribute to the nudge of civil society and patriotic Nigerians in making this brand new Electoral Act a reality.\u201d\n\nSaraki\u2019s thumb-up\n\nOn his part, a former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has commended President Buhari, the National Assembly, CSOs and other Nigerians who remained persistent in insisting that \u201cNigeria deserves a new law that will guarantee free, fair and peaceful polls in 2023 and beyond.\u201d\n\nSaraki in a statement by Yusuph Olaniyonu, Head of Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office, noted that while President Buhari \u201cdeserves commendation for working with the federal legislature and rising above partisan interest to give the country a new law that could reform the electoral process, the big applause should go to the members of the civil society organisations who for the past one year have kept up the pressure and continuously agitated for the passage of the new Electoral Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new Electoral Act brings us closer to having free, fair, and peaceful elections in which people\u2019s votes count, where the majority will have their way and the minority will have their say. For too long, the old electoral law had been part of the problem. We can now seek to elect our leaders having in mind the current challenges facing our country.\n\n\u201cWith a new Electoral Act, we can move on to debating real solutions to the problems of insecurity, creation of jobs, strengthening of the economy, cementing national unity and building a better future for all Nigerians,\u201d Saraki said.",

          "text": "Russia said on Friday it was partially limiting access to Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s Facebook, accusing it of \u201ccensoring\u201d Russian media, the latest in a series of steps against U.S. social media giants.\n\nMoscow has been trying to exert tighter control over the internet and big tech for years, something critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom, and is part of a wider crackdown against outspoken opponents of the Kremlin.\n\nThe state communications regulator said that Facebook had ignored its demands to lift restricts on four Russian media outlets on its platform \u2013 RIA news agency, the defence ministry\u2019s Zvezda TV and websites gazeta.ru and lenta.ru.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Russia\u2019s restrictions on Facebook would involve. Last year Moscow slowed down the speed of Twitter in a punitive move.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the decision of the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, starting from Feb. 25, partial access restrictions are being imposed by Roskomnadzor on the Facebook social network,\u201d the regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in a statement.\n\nFacebook, which had no immediate comment, has already irked Russia\u2019s authorities. Moscow routinely fines the company small sums for what it says is a failure to delete illegal content quickly enough.\n\nIn December, it issued a much bigger fine of 2 billion roubles ($24.27 million) for what it described as a repeated failure to delete content.\n\nMoscow has also increased pressure on domestic media, threatening to block reports that contain what it describes as \u201cfalse information\u201d regarding its military operation in Ukraine, where Russian missiles were pounding Kyiv and families cowered in shelters.",

          "title": "US: Three Minneapolis Ex-Police Officers Guilty of Violating George Floyd\u2019s Rights",
          "text": "Three former Minneapolis police officers were found guilty by a federal jury on Thursday of depriving George Floyd of his civil rights by failing to give aid to the handcuffed Black man pinned beneath a colleague\u2019s knee.\n\nThe jury also found that the conduct of officers Tou Thao, 36; J. Alexander Kueng, 28; and Thomas Lane, 38, during the arrest on May 25, 2020, caused Floyd\u2019s death, a finding that can affect the severity of their sentence.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIt is a rare instance of police officers being held criminally responsible for a colleague\u2019s excessive force. All three men were convicted of denying Floyd\u2019s constitutional right to medical care while in police custody.\n\nThao and Kueng were also convicted on a charge of denying Floyd\u2019s right to not face excessive force by failing to stop their colleague Derek Chauvin from kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was convicted last year in a state court of Floyd\u2019s murder.\n\nThao, Kueng and Lane will remain free on bail pending their sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled. Prosecutors have not yet said what sentence they will request, but the men may face years in prison.\n\n\u201cThis is just accountability,\u201d Philonise Floyd told reporters after the verdict was read. \u201cIt could never be justice because I can never get my brother back.\u201d\n\nThe verdict marked a second victory this week for prosecutors in the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, coming just two days after a jury in Georgia found three white men guilty of federal hate crimes in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man who was gunned down while running through a mostly white neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s historic for our country, because oftentimes officers kill Black and brown men and women, and we get little to no consequences,\u201d said Brandon Williams, George Floyd\u2019s nephew. \u201cA lot of times we don\u2019t even get charges, let alone convictions.\u201d\n\nKILLING SPARKED PROTESTS\n\nFederal prosecutors argued in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul that the men knew from their training and from \u201cbasic human decency\u201d that they had a duty to help Floyd as he begged for his life before falling limp beneath Chauvin\u2019s knee.\n\nFloyd\u2019s killing sparked protests in cities around the world against police brutality and racism.\n\nIt also led lawmakers to propose such measures as restricting chokeholds, banning \u201cno-knock warrants,\u201d and legislating to curtail the U.S. Supreme Court doctrine known \u201cqualified immunity\u201d that limits lawsuits over police use of excessive force.\n\nThose proposals were included in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives last year. Philonise Floyd on Thursday again urged lawmakers to pass the measure that has stalled in the Senate, where Democrats are unlikely to get the necessary Republican votes.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison last year after a state murder trial. Although race was not part of the state or federal charges, Chauvin\u2019s conviction was seen as a landmark rebuke of the disproportionate use of police force against Black Americans. In December, Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charge of violating Floyd\u2019s rights.\n\nUnder Chauvin\u2019s plea agreement, federal prosecutors will seek a 25-year sentence, concurrent with his state prison sentence. His three former colleagues are also due to stand trial in Minneapolis in June on state charges of aiding and abetting Floyd\u2019s murder.\n\nBYSTANDER VIDEO\n\nWidely seen cellphone video showed Thao stood steps away from Floyd, rebuffing the demands by horrified onlookers that Chauvin get off Floyd\u2019s neck. Kueng and Lane were to Chauvin\u2019s right, pinning down Floyd\u2019s buttocks and legs.\n\nAll three testified in their own defense. Each acknowledged they knew they had a duty of care to people in their custody. But they and their lawyers told jurors they did not realize at the time that Floyd was in dire need of medical aid or that Chauvin\u2019s use of force was excessive.\n\nProsecutors repeatedly played videos showing Floyd\u2019s distress was plain to bystanders, including children and an off-duty firefighter, who shouted that Floyd was passing out and begging the police to check his pulse.\n\nThe three defendants all described deferring to the authority of Chauvin, the most senior officer at the scene with 19 years at the Minneapolis Police Department. read more\n\nKueng and Lane, who first handcuffed Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill in a nearby store, also noted they were rookies only a few days out of training, which lasted more than a year. Thao had been on the force for eight years.\n\nMedical experts have testified that Floyd almost certainly would have survived the arrest if he had been rolled onto his side once the officers restrained him, as the officers acknowledged they had been taught to do.",
