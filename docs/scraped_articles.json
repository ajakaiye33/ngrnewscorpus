          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), says all those who tried to cover up the shootings at the Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020, must be sanctioned for complicity.\n\nSpecifically, Falana said the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed; the Attorney General of Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN); as well as the managers of the toll gate, the Lekki Concession Company; should be sanctioned for trying to cover up the \u201ccrimes against humanity committed at the toll gate\u201d during the EndSARS protests last year.\n\nFollowing the shootings and the reported killings at the Lekki toll gate, the Lagos State Government had constituted the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and other matters to, amongst other things, probe the Lekki incident.\n\nOn Monday, after about a year, the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led panel submitted its report to the Lagos State Government, noting that at least nine persons were confirmed dead at the Lekki toll plaza when soldiers stormed the tollgate to disperse EndSARS protesters on October 20, 2020.\n\nThe 309-page report stated, \u201cThe atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags and while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a massacre in context.\u201d\n\nIt recommended that all army officers deployed in the Lekki tollgate should be made to face appropriate disciplinary action, stripped of their ranks and dismissed as they were not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\n\nThe United States, the United Nations, the United Kingdom and Amnesty International have since called on the Nigerian authorities to ensure that the panel\u2019s report is handled transparently.\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who received the report on Monday, constituted a Committee to bring forward a White Paper within the next two weeks to be considered by the Lagos State Executive Council.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the panel\u2019s report negates the consistent claim by the Federal Government of Nigeria that there was no \u201cmassacre\u201d at the toll gate, a focal gathering point during last year\u2019s nationwide demonstration against extrajudicial killings and police brutality by operatives of the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nMinister of Information, Lai Mohammed, had at various times maintained that the Lekki incident was a \u201cmassacre without bodies\u201d and had threatened to sue Cable News Network and other international bodies that claimed otherwise.\n\nMalami had also said those who attacked the youths at Lekki toll gate weren\u2019t soldiers but wore military camouflages while the LCC had allegedly removed the closed-circuit television at the toll gate in a move that had been widely described as a cover-up.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Falana said those who released the Lekki panel report feared cover-up by the government, hence, they released the report to the public to know their findings.\n\nHe spoke on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nFalana, who said the report is one of the best so far in the country, added that there is no room for a cover-up.\n\nThe human rights lawyer noted that Mohammed, Malami, the LCC and all those who tried to cover up the killings at Lekki must be sanctioned.\n\nWhen asked whether the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), should speak on the report of the panel, Falana said, \u201cNo, not yet; the President made a broadcast last year in 2020 based on the information given to him. I\u2019m sure you are aware that five times, the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has said nobody was killed. The Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN), said those who appeared in Lekki were not Nigerian soldiers but people just put on military uniforms to perpetrate atrocities.\n\n\u201cEven the military denied that (but) it was when the young people who are advanced in technology and who took photographs in the night when the soldiers were shooting, it was at that stage that the military said, \u2018Yes, we were shooting, we only shot into the air\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd the panel found that even LAWMA (Lagos State Waste Management Authority) went there to do a clean-up in the night, in the early hours of 21st (of October 2020) so that there would be no trail but by the time the panel visited the scene of the incident they were still able to pick some expired bullets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe panel painstakingly analysed the evidence of every witness before arriving at the conclusion. So, it is difficult to cover up what happened on that day,\u201d he added.\n\nOn what should happen to the federal officers who allegedly tried to cover up, the senior advocate said, \u201cThey are all going to be sanctioned. Anybody who attempted to cover up would be sanctioned, any of them including those who managed Lekki, the LCC, because they disabled their system in order to cover up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny regime in the world that says these are federal officers and we are not going to sanction them, if you don\u2019t, these are materials for the ICC (International Criminal Court). Under the Rome Statute, the ICC will only intervene if a government is unwilling or unable to prosecute those who engaged in crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression. If by the time the (Lagos State) government issues its White Paper, recommendations are made and these people are not prosecuted, that is not the end of the matter. No President can behave as in the \u201880s, that this is an internal affair.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

James Odu, Public Relations Officer and Com. Victor Okon, Director Of Operations, Unified Commercial Drivers Association of Cross River State, the various Unions stated that the increment was due to the incessant hike in fuel and spare parts price in the market.\n\nThe Drivers lamented that the prices of spare parts and fuel has quadrupled since 2015 and they can no longer bear the burden, so the increment was inevitable.\n\n\u201cWe the Commercial Drivers of Calabar Metropolis have decided to increase transportation fare from 50 to 100 naira short distance due to high cost of spare parts, fuel and other commodities in the market.\n\n\u201cThe increment will take effect from Monday, November 22, 2021\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\n\u201cThe price of these commodities skyrocketed between 2015 and 2021 as engine oil that usually goes for 2,500naira was now 8,500 and so many other parts.\n\n\u201cBelgium tyre that sells for 3,000 is now 7,000 naira, fuel which was 87 naira is now 170 per litre in major parts of the Metropolis, Audi engine which sold for 60,000 is now 210,000 naira Timing belt that sells for NGN2,000 is now NGN15,000; and so on,\u201d they stated.\n\nVanguard however gathered that the planned hike of the price of the transport fair did not go down well with many commuters in the state capital adding that it was going to lead to a huge increase in the prices of goods and services.\n\nMany of them who spoke with Vanguard expressed shock adding that the timing was wrong and advised drivers to maintain the current price till the end of 2021 because the price of fuel would still come down.\n\nPascal Bajie told Vanguard that, their plight was valid, but the timing was wrong adding that increasing the price during the yuletide season was not such a good idea.\n\n\u201cThe fuel price, increase, we know is due to the season, and we also know that there is some increment here and there, but the effect of hiking transport fare will be huge, they should reconsider their stance on the matter before 22nd November.\n\nAnother commuter, Mr. Anthony Chijioke said the effect of adding the extra 50 naira would lead to a rise in the price of so many other items.\n\n\u201cThe other day it was Sachet water, today it is transport fare, I wonder what hope is left for the common man whose salary has not been increased but is expected to pay a higher price for goods and services, the move is insensitive,\u201d Chijioke bemoaned.\n\nRecall that the Association for Table Water Producers of Nigeria ATWAP had earlier in the month increased the price bag of sachet water 200 naira per bag.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Afe Babalola slams WAEC, NECO for shift in exam calendars",
          "text": "\u2026Says they are toying with students\u2019 lives\n\nBy Adesina Wahab\n\nThe Founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, ABUAD, Aare Afe Babalola, SAN, has decried the shift in the examination calendars by the West African Examinations Council, WAEC and the National Examinations Council, NECO from April to June to between August and October in the year.\n\nThis, according to him, is negatively affecting the chances of final year secondary students to secure admission to tertiary institutions.\n\nBabalola, in a statement signed by him and which was made available to our correspondent on Thursday, said the shift was also affecting the admission plans of tertiary institutions.\n\nWhile acknowledging the fact that the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic globally led to some disruptions, he opined that the two bodies ought to have got over the jolt and revert to their normal calendars by this year.\n\n\u201cThe West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) was established in 1952 primarily to conduct Senior School Certificate Examination specifically between the months of March and July to enable University students to prepare for admission into universities in the months of September/October annually. The set-up by West African countries was in conformity with international standard.\n\n\u201cGranted that Covid-19 Pandemic disrupted this arrangement in 2020, Universities all over the world including most of the universities in Nigeria (Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD) included have made use of Virtual Learning System to ensure that the age-long system of academic calendar was not disrupted.\n\nWith the combination of Physical and Virtual Learning, Universities all over the world have continued to meet their obligations to the students and their parents. Therefore, they have been able to complete sessional examinations and admit students annually. Consequently, last year session ended in June and this year session began in September, 2021 in ABUAD and many other universities.\n\n\u201cWAEC which used to conduct yearly examination between April and June and released results between July and August, conducted this year\u2019s examination from 16th August to 1st October, 2021. In spite of the fact that it was late in conducting the examination, surprisingly, it is yet to publish the result.\n\n\u201cNECO on the other hand which used to conduct its examination between May and July conducted this year\u2019s examination from July 5, 2021 to August 16, 2021. The result was not released until October 30, 2021.\n\nThe effect of this delay by both NECO and WAEC is most damaging for both students, parents and universities. The undue delay has dislocated the programmes of the Universities to the detriment of the university-bound students. It has also created a lot of problems for the universities, teachers, the government and proprietors of private universities who in any event must pay their teachers in order to retain their services.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the worst damage done by WAEC and NECO is that most of these students, if not all,may lose a whole year or substantial part of a year idling away and suffering in silence.\n\n\u201cA loss of a year or less or more by anybody may cause irreparable damage forever. According to the saying by C. R. Lawton in Forbes Magazine that:\n\n\u201cTime is the one thing that can never be retrieved. One may lose and regain a friend; one may lose and regain money; opportunity once spurned may come again; but the hours that are lost in idleness can never be brought back to be used in gainful pursuits. Most careers are made or marred in the hours after supper,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cAs a concerned University Proprietor, I call on the Federal Ministry of Education, the National Universities Commission and the Federal Government to call upon WAEC and NECO to address the problem they have created for University-bound students, teachers, parents and the country at large and call on WAEC to release the result immediately. It should also be warned to take the future of the students into consideration in fixing the date of their examination and release of result in such a way that their future will not be adversely affected.\u201d\n\nHe noted that his call became necessary because of the importance of education to human beings.\n\n\u201cEducation is power. Education is the surest pathway to overcome disease, poverty and ignorance and also to acquire clean and unquestionable wealth. It is an insurance for stable government, clean environment and avoidance of imminent damage to the climate and our mother earth.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason and others that prosperous and advanced countries spend as much as 26-33 percent of their budgets on education annually. Unfortunately, in Nigeria the investment by State and Federal Government through budget allocation is sometimes as low as 5% of the annual budget!!\n\n\u201cCivilized countries such as England, Canada, USA, Japan, Australia etc, have standardized and predictable academic calendar when schools or universities will resume and close,\u201d he noted.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The security detail initially barricaded all road along the street and stopped vehicular and human movements. Not willing to leave anything to chance, the security was further reinforced by 1.39pm when personnel of the Department of State Services (DSS) Special Force stormed the secretariat on a patrol van and power bikes to provide backups.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe situation was so tensed that women party members from Bauchi State that accompanied their leader on solidarity visit were not allowed access into the Buhari House for hours between 10am and 3.00pm.\n\nThe security personnel later relaxed their surveillance when the protesters did not show up by afternoon and allowed passers-by and motorists to access the road without subjecting them to screening or interrogation. They, however, strategically positioned their patrol vehicles at both Valencia Hotel and Barcelona Hotel ends of the street and at the back of the secretariat to forestall any attempt by the protesters to access the party headquarters.\n\nA semblance of calmness, however, returned to the secretariat by evening when the deployed security agents thinned down.\n\nA member of the party\u2019s internal security said the massive deployment was a response to threat from certain \u201cdisgruntled\u201d party members.\n\n\u201cWe had security report that some people have plans to come and protest here. The national leadership had to order the deployment of police and other security agencies to forestall any breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cThis is the second time we are seeing this kind of deployment at the secretariat. It actually showed that some party members are really aggrieved and there is a limit to what they can do to continue to stop the protesters. The committee should also know that they have overstayed their welcome and should be ready to conduct the national convention. They cannot be there forever. From six months to one year and still counting,\u201d the source said.\n\nAsked why the deployment, the National Secretary, APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, said the party\u2019s national leadership did not want to be caught off guard.\n\n\u201cOh, nothing is happening. They have been there several times whenever we need to safeguard the secretariat. You are not in position to read security reports, so you cannot ask me. If something happens now, they will say what were they doing.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that have to do with security that you are not aware of. It is a routine thing, the police liase with FCT Minister, the IG and other people if they have any information. Not only here, if you are coming to Abuja, going to the airport, we have duty to protect the people who work here, we read security reports and I am sure you are fully aware we have every security agency in our secretariat. We are only acting on security reports, there is no cause for alarm.\u201d\n\nThere had been several instances of police occupation of the APC secretariat to forestall plans of aggrieved members protesting the outcome of the congresses across the country to disrupt activities.\n\nVirtually in all the states of the federation, the party has been engulfed in crisis, resulting in the emergence of parallel ward, local governments and state executives. The situation is the same from Rivers, Akwa-Ibom, Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Kano, Enugu, Abia, Imo, Osun, Ogun, Kwara, Delta to Gombe and other States.\n\nWithin two week, protesters from Bauchi State had grounded the secretariat to demand urgent intervention of the national leadership to the crisis rocking the party in the state. Aggrieved party members from Oyo State had equally stormed the party headquarters to demand the reconciliation of the warring factions in the state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, yesterday said getting appropriate financing for major projects remains key challenge in the global transition to renewable sources of energy.\n\nKyari, who spoke on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition Conference (ADIPEC) in the United Arab Emirates, insisted that no nation should be stampeded into abandoning fossil fuels because each country has its peculiar energy history.\n\nThe NNPC GMD noted that with the commencement of the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), investors were beginning to pour into the country especially to invest in the deep-water segment of the oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to the NNPC helmsman, Artificial Intelligence (AI) remained the future of the strategic application of technology in the industry, explaining that although Nigeria is still at the very basic stage, it also has the advantage to procure the most modern carbon-free systems.\n\nKyari argued that the Nigerian oil industry had become more competitive with the new PIA, maintaining that the country now has a clearer fiscal environment and a stronger regulatory ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are at the threshold of history. Our country has changed and our industry has changed because we have a new legislation that has brought clarity in the way we do our business. We have a much more competitive fiscal environment and much more modern regulatory environment and we are seeing the outcome of all these coming up.\n\n\u201cOur partners are coming up to invest, especially in the deepwater and also a lot of efforts are going on to bring back all of the production that we have lost and we are very excited for our country.\n\n\u201cI think the key challenge of the energy transition is financing what we need to do today, to produce gas and consume gas in the best possible manner and you can\u2019t produce hydrogen without properly doing it. The key challenges is financing and also realising that different countries have different circumstances, that jurisdictions are different and that we can\u2019t move at the same pace,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe urged proponents of the energy transition to appreciate the basic fact that the circumstances of every nation is peculiar and take it into consideration.\n\n\u201cCountries have different exposures and the handling (of the transition) must be in different manners and I am not sure this is properly appreciated,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn the application of technology in the transition process, he added: \u201cArtificial intelligence is the way to go in the future. We saw this coming, but currently we are at the basic level , but we are making efforts to ensure that we automate our systems and our processes.\n\n\u201cWe will make use of the best technology that is available. But Good enough for our country, we are starting from almost ground zero in sub-Saharan Africa and so carbon production petroleum systems will now be based on the basis of current technology that is available and clearly the emissions will be quite low in this circumstances,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that although climate change is real, there are real problems in the world, noting that for this reason, every stakeholder must work together.\n\n\u201cWe should work towards net-zero by 2050, for some countries 2060, but obviously it\u2019s a step we must take and I think it\u2019s a good development,\u201d Kyari stressed.\n\nOn the importance of the conference, he stated that ADIPEC had brought everyone on the table to realise that the entire industry needs to work together to achieve net-zero by 2050 or \u201cshortly after that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Executive Director, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr. AbdulKabir Ahmed, has said the implementation of the PIA has opened more opportunities for investors in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nSpeaking on a panel at the same event, on the theme \u2018\u2018Building the Energy Company of the Future: New Business Models and Investment Flows\u201d, Ahmed emphasised that since the PIA became law, many opportunities had been made available to investors, especially in the area of gas.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some kind of opportunities as far as the law is concerned. We have seen several bottlenecks that have been removed and those who wish to invest are encouraged to come and invest and it is everybody\u2019s destination for now and those who have investments they want to make are welcome,\u201d he said.\n\nHe attributed the rising gas prices to certain uncertainties brought about by production and supply challenges coupled with the climate change issue.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of uncertainties, not only in terms of production and supply, but we also have nature itself playing its own role and we can look at it from this perspective.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the climate change, the winter, the direction of the timing whether it is prolonged or shortened, it now gives you this kind of energy demand. Then, you cannot determine when the winter will begin and that can spur volatility,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAhmed explained that the NNPC will continue to do more in deepening the gas sector by finding the most convenient way of transporting gas, adding that the corporation will continue to build infrastructure in addition to the pipelines that are being built.\n\n\u201cA lot of confidence is being reposed in Nigeria as an investment environment. Now, that is leading to the Train 8. We are also contemplating on it. So, if Train 8 is being contemplated, then that means that that environment is still viable for investors to come in,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Bandits have sent threats to the Fa'a Gaya community in the Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State demanding N30million ransom so that they would not invade and launch terror on the community.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from a save-our-soul call made to the government and civil societies that the bandits were on the heels of attacking the community.\n\n\n\nAn authoritative source noted that the villagers, living in fear and trepidation of the terror of bandits had gradually started to desert the community as efforts to get the intervention of security agencies have proved abortive.\n\nAccording to him, the bandits called initially with a phone number which was not registered and later called with another, traced to a name and location which the leaders provided the police but the police refused to launch an investigation into the matter.\n\nHe said, rather than investigate, the police instead detained a young man whom the bandits contacted initially.\n\nHe also stated that the police have since harassed community leaders who have gone to report to the police.\n\nHe said that the community is not far from Garaha, the village where the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, hails from.\n\n\u201cThe number of soldiers stationed at the SGF home can provide adequate security for the whole of Fa'a Gaya if the military are really interested in protecting people.\n\n\u201cKidnappers have threatened to wipe out one village called Fa'a Gaya in Hong LGA of Adamawa State. The kidnappers called the villagers with this mobile phone number 09046824117 and asked them to pay N30,000,000 within 3 days or they will come to the village, kill all of them and burn down the whole village.\n\n\u201dWhen we checked the mobile phone number, the one that was used to call the elders of Fa'a Gaya the above mobile number is not registered.\n\n\u201cAnother number called them this evening, it is registered with the name Kalu Telor at Wuse this is the phone number 09021780601 and negotiating with the elders of Fa'a Gaya a Killba community in Hong LGA of Adamawa State and the elders even offered the kidnappers N1 million but the kidnappers came down from N30 million to N5 million naira and they said they will still continue with the negotiation tomorrow.\n\n\u201dThe community reported to Nigeria Police but no action has been taken yet, therefore we are calling for Killba prominent political leaders to take action before it will be too late and innocent lives lost in that community.\n\n\u201cThe police arrested the first person the kidnappers contacted and instead of tracing the phone number to the people issuing threats, they have detained the young man.\n\n\u201cNow, the bandits are contacting another elder in the community, and they also want to detain him \u2014 for what? We have provided phone numbers to the police, they should do the needful. They are now harassing innocent residents who are also potential victims.\n\n\u201dThe kidnappers are threatening the villagers right now that the villagers are playing with the kidnapper's intelligence therefore they can come into the village called Fa'a Gaya to attack.\u201d\n\nHe further said when he contacted the Department of State Services, he was informed that the information had been communicated with the military adding that the DSS said the police could not handle the issue.\n\nHe further said the military was trying to engage the services of local vigilantes and hunters in dealing with the bandits as he queried the competence of the military.\n\nHe said, \u201cSeveral times, they have asked the villagers to send them recharge cards with the mobile phone number that we have sent to security agencies. Why is it that the Nigerian government neglected its citizens and even hand them over to criminals kidnappers, bandits, Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists?\n\n\u201cSince Saturday 13/11/2021 we have been sending information to the security agencies about what Nigerian masses of Fa'a Gaya community in Hong LGA of Adamawa State are going through in the hands of these terrorists by threatening the villagers.\n\n\u201cRight now the leaders of Fa'a Gaya community are holding meetings because of the terrible tribulation and trauma that they are going through. Since Saturday, we have sent all the necessary information about this matter to security agencies and prominent politicians from Killba community but no single security operatives deployed to the village to protect the lives and properties of the villagers.\n\n\u201dIt seems the security agencies are not interested in protecting the lives and properties of innocent Nigerian masses you will give them important information but they'll frustrate you.\n\n\u201cUntil the criminals, terrorists will carry out their operation on innocent Nigerians before the security agencies start giving excuses for nothing! The behaviour of our government and security agencies about how are handling criminals Kidnappers bandits Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists makes me believe what the United States of America said about the Nigerian government and sponsoring terrorists in continue killing her citizens and it's very true.\n\n\u201cGod is going to deal with every government official who has hands in the killing of innocent Nigerian masses very soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Kkidnappers communicated with the leadership of Fa'a Gaya village yesterday evening that if the villagers don't bring the money to them they were going to strike out the village. I have spoken with the DSS yesterday evening but they said they have already sent the information to the military but it seems the military is not taking action against the kidnappers on time because nothing is being done,\u201d he added.\n\nOther residents told SaharaReporters that the Chief of Army Staff must draw the attention of the Yola Brigadier Commander to the impending attack.",

          "text": "Bandits have sent threats to the Fa'a Gaya community in the Hong Local Government Area of Adamawa State demanding N30million ransom so that they would not invade and launch terror on the community.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from a save-our-soul call made to the government and civil societies that the bandits were on the heels of attacking the community.\n\n\n\nAn authoritative source noted that the villagers, living in fear and trepidation of the terror of bandits had gradually started to desert the community as efforts to get the intervention of security agencies have proved abortive.\n\nAccording to him, the bandits called initially with a phone number which was not registered and later called with another, traced to a name and location which the leaders provided the police but the police refused to launch an investigation into the matter.\n\nHe said, rather than investigate, the police instead detained a young man whom the bandits contacted initially.\n\nHe also stated that the police have since harassed community leaders who have gone to report to the police.\n\nHe said that the community is not far from Garaha, the village where the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, hails from.\n\n\u201cThe number of soldiers stationed at the SGF home can provide adequate security for the whole of Fa'a Gaya if the military are really interested in protecting people.\n\n\u201cKidnappers have threatened to wipe out one village called Fa'a Gaya in Hong LGA of Adamawa State. The kidnappers called the villagers with this mobile phone number 09046824117 and asked them to pay N30,000,000 within 3 days or they will come to the village, kill all of them and burn down the whole village.\n\n\u201dWhen we checked the mobile phone number, the one that was used to call the elders of Fa'a Gaya the above mobile number is not registered.\n\n\u201cAnother number called them this evening, it is registered with the name Kalu Telor at Wuse this is the phone number 09021780601 and negotiating with the elders of Fa'a Gaya a Killba community in Hong LGA of Adamawa State and the elders even offered the kidnappers N1 million but the kidnappers came down from N30 million to N5 million naira and they said they will still continue with the negotiation tomorrow.\n\n\u201dThe community reported to Nigeria Police but no action has been taken yet, therefore we are calling for Killba prominent political leaders to take action before it will be too late and innocent lives lost in that community.\n\n\u201cThe police arrested the first person the kidnappers contacted and instead of tracing the phone number to the people issuing threats, they have detained the young man.\n\n\u201cNow, the bandits are contacting another elder in the community, and they also want to detain him \u2014 for what? We have provided phone numbers to the police, they should do the needful. They are now harassing innocent residents who are also potential victims.\n\n\u201dThe kidnappers are threatening the villagers right now that the villagers are playing with the kidnapper's intelligence therefore they can come into the village called Fa'a Gaya to attack.\u201d\n\nHe further said when he contacted the Department of State Services, he was informed that the information had been communicated with the military adding that the DSS said the police could not handle the issue.\n\nHe further said the military was trying to engage the services of local vigilantes and hunters in dealing with the bandits as he queried the competence of the military.\n\nHe said, \u201cSeveral times, they have asked the villagers to send them recharge cards with the mobile phone number that we have sent to security agencies. Why is it that the Nigerian government neglected its citizens and even hand them over to criminals kidnappers, bandits, Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists?\n\n\u201cSince Saturday 13/11/2021 we have been sending information to the security agencies about what Nigerian masses of Fa'a Gaya community in Hong LGA of Adamawa State are going through in the hands of these terrorists by threatening the villagers.\n\n\u201cRight now the leaders of Fa'a Gaya community are holding meetings because of the terrible tribulation and trauma that they are going through. Since Saturday, we have sent all the necessary information about this matter to security agencies and prominent politicians from Killba community but no single security operatives deployed to the village to protect the lives and properties of the villagers.\n\n\u201dIt seems the security agencies are not interested in protecting the lives and properties of innocent Nigerian masses you will give them important information but they'll frustrate you.\n\n\u201cUntil the criminals, terrorists will carry out their operation on innocent Nigerians before the security agencies start giving excuses for nothing! The behaviour of our government and security agencies about how are handling criminals Kidnappers bandits Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists makes me believe what the United States of America said about the Nigerian government and sponsoring terrorists in continue killing her citizens and it's very true.\n\n\u201cGod is going to deal with every government official who has hands in the killing of innocent Nigerian masses very soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Kkidnappers communicated with the leadership of Fa'a Gaya village yesterday evening that if the villagers don't bring the money to them they were going to strike out the village. I have spoken with the DSS yesterday evening but they said they have already sent the information to the military but it seems the military is not taking action against the kidnappers on time because nothing is being done,\u201d he added.\n\nOther residents told SaharaReporters that the Chief of Army Staff must draw the attention of the Yola Brigadier Commander to the impending attack.",

          "text": "The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has reacted to the report submitted by the Lagos State Judicial panel on Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS)-related abuses.\n\nOn October 19, 2021, the state government inaugurated the panel as part of recommendations put forward during the #EndSARS protests last year.\n\nLai Mohammed\n\nThe report found that the Nigerian Army and police fired live bullets at peaceful protesters at the Lekki Tollgate last year.\n\nIt also concluded that the \u201cdeliberate absence of officers of the Nigerian Army who were present at the Lekki Toll Gate and who were summoned by the Panel was a calculated attempt to conceal material evidence from the Panel\u201d.\n\nReacting in a statement, the Minority Caucus said attempts by the Nigerian government officials to cover up the massacre at the Lekki Tollgate suggests a high-level state-backed conspiracy against Nigerians.\n\nThe statement, signed by Ndudi Elumelu, the minority leader of the House, queried the motive of the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, that made him rush to the media, ahead of the judicial panel, to insist that there were no killings at Lekki Tollgate, even in the face of testimonies of witnesses.\n\nIt, therefore, urged the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to come clean on the killings.\n\nThe Minority Caucus, therefore, urged Nigerians to remain calm, vowing to leave no stone unturned in using legislative instruments to join forces with other well-meaning Nigerians.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives, after a thorough review of the report of the Lagos State EndSARS judicial panel, holds that the attempt by officials of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government to cover up the now confirmed bloody massacre of Nigerians youths by security forces at the Lekki Tollgate suggests a high-level state-backed conspiracy against Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe confirmation by the Lagos Panel that there was indeed a massacre at the Lekki Tollgate during the 2020 EndSARS protests in Lagos and that APC government-controlled security forces carted away bodies and mopped up evidence, places a huge burden on the Federal Government which had vehemently denied any killings.\n\n\u201dThe Minority caucus is therefore apprehensive as to what furtive motive must have made the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who ought to know the truth, to rush to the media, ahead of the judicial panel, to insist that there were no killings at Lekki Tollgate, even in the face of testimonies of witnesses at the sad event.\n\n\u201cWhereas the proclivity of the APC-led administration to lie to Nigerians on issues is legendry and known to all, our caucus is however shocked that the administration can lie in a matter that has to do with the gruesome killing of citizens, particularly our youths and even attempt to provide official cover to the culprits.\n\n\u201dAs representatives of the people, the minority caucus holds that killing of our young ones for having the audacity to demand justice, rule of law and good governance in our nation is the height of wickedness which will continue to haunt the APC and its administration until justice is served.\n\n\u201cThe report of the Lagos panel shows that no matter how lies and falsehood try to prevail, the truth will always triumph at the end. The blood of the innocent slain at Lekki Tollgate cries out for justice and there will be no rest for their killers and those who give support or cover to the murderous act.\n\n\u201cThe Minority Caucus, therefore, calls on the APC-led administration to come clean on the killings as well as the furtive moves to cover up the vicious act. Also, given the findings of the Lagos panel, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed is expected to resign immediately or be fired by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cOur caucus commends the Lagos panel for its boldness in the pursuit of truth and justice and urges other panels investigating allegations of brutality in other states not to be deterred but ensure that the truth is not suppressed.\n\n\u201cWhile commiserating with the victims of the Lekki Tollgate attack, particularly the families of those killed, the Minority Caucus urges Nigerians to remain calm at this crucial moment, as we will leave no stone unturned in using our legislative instruments to join forces with other well-meaning Nigerians to get justice for our people.\u201d",

          "text": "Sunrise Power Transmission Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPTCL) has agreed to waive the $500 million penalty fee incurred by the federal government over multiple defaults of a $200 million settlement agreement on the Mambilla hydroelectric power project in Taraba state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been a legal tussle stalling the execution of the $5.8 billion project.\n\nSunrise Power had, on October 10, 2017, dragged Nigeria to the ICC International Court of Arbitration, Paris, France, seeking a $2.354 billion award for \u201cbreach of contract\u201d in relation to a 2003 agreement to construct the 3,050MW plant in Mambilla, Taraba state, on a \u201cbuild, operate and transfer\u201d basis.\n\nThe company also joined Sinohydro Corporation Limited, the Chinese company currently handling the project, in the arbitration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo resolve the issue, the federal government agreed to pay Sunrise Power $200 million \u201cwithin 14 days\u201d of the execution of the terms of the agreement on January 21, 2020, and also pay a penalty of 10 per cent in case of a default in fulfilling the settlement agreement \u2014 in addition to restoring Sunrise as the local content partner for the $5.8 billion project.\n\nHowever, the federal government was said to have entered into an out-of-court settlement in the course of arbitral proceedings at the court of arbitration following its default of over a half a billion-dollar penalty.\n\nIn an interview with Arise TV, Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), said Nigeria could have lost about a billion dollars to the case but for the \u201cpatriotic act\u201d of Leno Adesanya, chief executive officer of Sunrise Power, to discontinue the arbitral proceedings in France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the matter, Kayode Ajulo, a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, United Kingdom, described the decision by Sunrise Power as the best, as it signifies the end of all impediments relating to the Mambilla project.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how arbitration operates would give insight to this extant settlement. Since the funder, Chinese Exim Bank, and the contractor Syno Hydro Company are really pushing for the settlement agreement as failure to do so will not allow them to proceed further on the contract, it is imperative for the Government to honour its negotiation out of the pending arbitration in Paris with Messrs Sunrise Company, as a consent arbitral award to end the matter in order for the parties to move forward,\u201d Ajulo said.\n\n\u201cThe claim and any other ancillary expenses and or interest from the date the settlement agreement was signed to date, is the best negotiation ever the government has made.\n\n\u201cThere should be an end to litigation, parties must resolve the issue and get to work from which Nigerian government and people will benefit mainly therefrom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 3,050-megawatt facility, the biggest plant in the country and the second-largest hydropower plant in Africa when completed, was conceived in the 1970s but has suffered severe delays.",

          "title": "Jumia records all-time high quarterly orders and unveils its fintech ambition",
          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This week, Africa Health Holdings, a healthcare startup that operates 40 medical facilities across three countries in Africa, said it has secured $18 million Series A funding.\n\nThe funding round was led by Asia Pacific Land and Natural World Limited, with the participation of a number of investors including TRB Advisors, Breyer Capital, M3, Inc., Valiant Capital, Kepple Ventures, and SUNU Capital. According to the startup, it has raised a total of $21 million in funding so far.\n\nAfrica Health Holdings plans to deploy the funds towards building its \u201ctech-forward healthcare system\u201d across the continent. Specifically, it intends to expand its telemedicine service beyond Ghana to Nigeria and Kenya, and scale its network of health facilities.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sangu Delle, Africa Health Holdings operates in all three African countries under three brands: Meridian Health Group (in Kenya), Rabito Clinic Ltd (in Ghana), and Care Point Hospitals Ltd (in Nigeria).\n\nDelle is a Harvard and Oxford graduate, a TED Fellow, World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, and also the former CEO of Golden Palm Investments, an investment holding company with an interest in early-stage opportunities in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe founding of Africa Health Holdings was inspired by the need to \u201caddress Africa\u2019s disproportionate share of the global disease burden.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Ghana, Delle witnessed the challenges that everyday Ghanaians faced in trying to access quality healthcare: from proximity to medical facilities, availability of doctors and nurses, access to the right medical equipment, prescriptions, and more.\n\n\u201cMy father, a doctor, would often take time away from his private practice to do human rights work, providing healthcare to refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis all had a lasting impact, making me interested above all else, in changing healthcare for the better, across the continent.\u201d\n\nDelle\u2019s first efforts aimed at improving healthcare in Africa came through Golden Palm Investments (GPI). As the former CEO of GPI, he and his team began making healthcare investments in 2010 and piloted the model for how technology could be leveraged to expand access to healthcare while increasing affordability. In 2017, Delle took his learnings from all the healthcare investments he lead at GPI and founded Africa Health Holdings.\n\nSangu Delle, founder and CEO of Africa Health Holdings. Image credit: HBS Alumni\n\nIn addition to its medical facilities, Africa Health Holdings operates pharmacies and labs throughout each of the countries, to provide its patients with requisite medications and lab results. In all, it serves more than 200,000 patients annually.\n\nA telemedicine mobile platform, MyCareMobile, connects each of the startup\u2019s brands. The app is said to provide patients with access to services through teleconferencing, including medical consultations, access to test results, and 24-hour emergency response.\n\nAs mobile penetration increases in Africa, MyCareMobile helps reduce in-person visits by allowing virtual follow-up consultations with doctors and nurses.\n\n\u201cOur online and offline care model allows our patients to access care anytime, anywhere,\u201d Delle said. \u201cWe are keeping healthcare costs affordable while broadening the availability of quality healthcare in the countries we operate in.\u201d\n\nMeridian has a total of 16 medical facilities\u201412 providing outpatient services and inpatient health services in Kenya, three hospitals, and a drug and alcohol recovery centre.\n\nRabito has a chain of 21 dermatology and general medical facilities, located throughout Ghana while Care Point has two hospitals and one clinic in Nigeria.\n\nThe next global healthcare frontier\n\nOn Monday, Nigeria-based DrugStoc also announced a $4.4 million Series A fundraising round, led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund, with participation from Vested World and German Development Bank.\n\nDrugStoc is focused on the medical supply chain and operates a digital platform that helps healthcare providers access pharmaceutical and healthcare products. It plans to expand its tech beyond Lagos by investing in cold chain infrastructure and building on its partnerships.\n\nThese developments reflect the growth of West Africa\u2019s digital health market as the sector attracts global investors. And according to Delle, the African continent, as a whole, is the next global frontier for healthcare.\n\n\u201cOur population is projected to grow by an additional 1 billion people by 2050, and 1 out of every 4 people in the world will be African,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will no longer allow past narratives of infectious, preventable diseases to continue to define Africa, our people, and our future.\u201d\n\nIn addition to expanding its footprint within the countries it currently operates within, Africa Health Holdings plans to expand to the Northern and Southern parts of Africa, in line with a grand vision to become \u201cthe biggest healthcare provider in Africa\u201d.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyityayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m. This trend will continue.\u201d\n\nIn September 2020, South African edtech startup, Valenture Institute, raised a $7 million Series A from GSV Ventures.\n\nIn January 2021, Nigerian edtech startup, uLesson, also raised $7 million in a Series A investment round led by Owl Ventures.\n\nThe next frontier\n\nBased on United Nations\u2019 estimates, according to Worldometer, Africa currently has a population of 1.3 billion people, with a median age of 19.7 years. This number is expected to grow to 1.6 billion by 2030.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, discussions about the next frontier in different sectors would be in the limelight. In anticipation of these discourses, we are talking to industry leaders, getting opinions, and seeking patterns.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have you join us in January 2022.

Emmanuel Paul has that answer and more here: Led by ex-OPay exec, Kredi Money wants to be the one-stop-shop for payments, loans, insurance, other financial services.\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Pays, CEO and Co-Founder of Ozow\n\nSouth African fintech startup, Ozow has closed a $48 million Series B to ease online payments for South Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, The funding was led by Tencent, a Chinese Internet-based company. Other investors, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund, also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Ozow do? The startup makes it possible to pay online with bank transfers or manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) without using your bank app.\n\nHow? It\u2019s called automated EFT; it works just like a payment gateway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen making an online payment, customers choose Ozow as a payment option, select a bank, log in with online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment.\n\nMerchants, on the other hand, only need an account number and smartphone to receive payments.\n\nOzow\u2019s CEO, Thomas Pays, says he started the company in 2014 to create a \u201ccentral platform that could basically provide solutions to eCommerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, Pays says, seven years ago, digital payment was very fragmented,\n\n\u201cif I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my eCommerce site, I need to go to a PayU.\u201d\n\nOzow plans to use the funding to expand its team from 100 to 250. A part of it will also be geared towards expansion into Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nAccording to Statista, the blockchain technology market is currently valued at $6.92 billion. That value is expected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027. This means that as the market grows, the demand for blockchain talent will also increase.\n\nIn light of this, African crypto exchange, Bitmama, is launching Bitmama Credits Programme to support young people globally with the skills needed to get a career in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe programme will begin in the first quarter of next year, offering blockchain learning materials and internships.\n\nThe big picture: With the advent of several blockchain innovations such as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing.\n\nIn 2019, the demand for blockchain jobs increased by 300% from the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, high demand also means huge salaries. The average salary for a blockchain developer is between $150,000 and $175,000; that\u2019s approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers.\n\nWhy\u2019s there so much demand?: According to 101 Blockchains, the need for blockchain talent is fueled by the advantages of blockchain, such as security, transparency, and traceability.\n\nWith more innovations coming out of the space, the demand for blockchain talent is bound to increase.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nGoogle\u2019s Next $1 Trillion Opportunity.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s financial services industry has been exploding in 2021. Payments, digital lending, and savings companies have become popular with investors looking to take a slice of Nigeria\u2019s fintech market.\n\nConsequently, looking at Nigeria\u2019s financial services space will reveal several startups with diverse financial use cases. But for the founders of digital banking startup, Kredi Money, financial services consumers could receive a better experience.\n\nBetween 2005 to 2009, Afolabi Abimbola, CEO of Kredi Money, first plied his trade as a Sales Manager for Globacom, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost telecom companies. In 2010, he became a Business Development Manager at Funds and Electronic Transfer Solutions (FETS) Limited, a pioneer of mobile payments in Nigeria.\n\nHe then held management-level positions at Renmoney, a prominent microfinance bank and digital lender, and Director-level positions at and OPay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArmed with these experiences, Abimbola began to observe gaps in the financial services industry he aimed to close.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the average consumer in Nigeria uses a separate app for borrowing, another one for saving, and another one for investing. In some cases, some use a particular platform for the purpose of making payments only,\u201d Abimbola says.\n\nHe then brought on Samuel Orji, a legal professional and seasoned investment professional, as co-founder. His most recent position is with a US-based emerging markets-focused VC investor, where he has been responsible for leading fintech investments across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKredi money was pretty much the brainchild of their combined experiences in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Left to Right: Samuel Orji, Co-founder Kredi Money, and Afolabi Abimbola, CEO of Kredi Money. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cThe early foundations for Kredi started being laid in early 2021. Over the past few months, we have been building our fully-digitised bank (Kredi Bank) in stealth.\u201d\n\nThey built Kredi Money to provide solutions across five financial areas: Savings, Spending, Investing, Borrowing (Loans), and protection (Insurance) for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) and individuals at the mid-bottom of the pyramid.\n\n\u201cWe aim to be a one-stop-shop for financial solutions and be a welcome break from the current fragmented solutions that characterises the market. We currently serve users primarily through our apps (Kredi) available on the Android and iOS stores.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are developing a diverse suite of products that would enable us to reach users via multiple channels including web and offline through agents.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Abimbola, after executing the pilot phase that saw the company gain over 8,000 users across the country, it is now poised for a full launch.\n\nBuilding in a highly competitive market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi will be entering a space currently dominated by traditional financial services companies, digital banks, and payments companies, but its unique offering seems to be catching on with its users.\n\nIts competitors include commercial banks, neobanks like Kuda, Sparkle, Carbon, Fairmoney, and companies like Branch playing in the micro-lending space.\n\nSide Note: Both Carbon and Fairmoney started as micro-lending companies before making the transition to digital banking.\n\nInterestingly, three of these neobanks \u2014 Kuda, Fairmoney, Sparkle \u2014 have raised a combined $125 million in 2021 alone, signifying investor confidence in digital banking, not unlike other parts of the globe.\n\nBesides bringing a one-stop-shop for the entire spectrum of financial services, Abimbola believes Kredi\u2019s focus on the mid to lower market, which has a fatter tail, is a significant advantage.\n\nWhile major Neobanks have either followed a payment driven model or a credit led model, Kredi\u2019s core business model is similar to that of other banks; mobilise deposits and then invest and issue loans.\n\nRemarkably, Abimbola points out that the business has witnessed strong growth in fees from its B2B component.\n\n\u201cWe are also leveraging our robust payment experience and expertise to provide API-based payment infrastructure services to fellow fintech startups that are either not fully licensed or don\u2019t have the technology to carry out mass payments,\u201d he explains.\n\nAbimbola also affirms that Kredi\u2019s payments arm has generated substantial revenues, and it\u2019s currently growing really fast.\n\nKredi\u2019s growing pains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi has only been in existence for a few months. Most of it has been spent setting up the groundwork for the business.\n\n\u201cWe only just kicked off our pilot phase. However, we have grown quite well. We have already exceeded $10,000 in monthly revenue and processed over $2.4 million. We expect to break into profitability in the next couple of months,\u201d Abimbola says.\n\nAccording to Abimbola, Kredi currently has over 8500 users, and about 65% (5,525) are monthly active users. The company defines these as people who conduct at least three transactions on the platform each month.\n\n\u201cWorthy of note that we got these numbers in our pilot phase, without any marketing spend. Major partners on the B2B side of things include Crowdyvest, Youverify and Chipper Cash. We have a strong pipeline of B2B partners lined up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKredi\u2019s growth in a short space of time has not been without its fair share of challenges.\n\nA recurring trend among budding tech entrepreneurs we\u2019ve featured in the last few years has been the difficulty of securing talent. Kredi was not an exception in this instance.\n\n\u201cAs with any startup, it\u2019s never an easy ride to get people to buy into your dream early on. But we have been extremely lucky to have come across some amazing folks who chose to go on this journey with us,\u201d Abimbola reveals.\n\nHe also says that the company has maintained a healthy workplace culture for its talented team.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that we are building an atmosphere that encourages openness, intellectual curiosity and empathy. There\u2019s still a long way to go, but we are excited for what the future holds on this front.\u201d\n\nFuture growth and expansion plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, Kredi Money has been largely bootstrapped to date with some support from Angel investors. Abimbola reveals that he wanted to lay the groundwork for a financial services company, before approaching institutional investors.\n\n\u201cWe have secured all the required licenses from the relevant regulators. We got to 8,000 users without any marketing spend. Customers clearly like our product. And we have big-name players looking to partner with us. We are at an inflection point in our growth and we are looking to scale this up.\u201d\n\nThe company is currently on the verge of opening a pre-seed round, and the founder says that investors are interested, clearly amazed by the traction the company has built without external funding.\n\n\u201cThis fundraise is exclusively for the purpose of driving growth and scaling up the business. This contrasts sharply with the practice in the industry where a significant chunk of initial fundraising is typically channelled towards securing licenses,\u201d Abimbola avers.\n\nIn the short term, the company is focused on growing its customer base in Nigeria and rolling out new products to serve customers of other banks. One of such products is \u201cTrickle\u201d.\n\nThough Abimbola didn\u2019t explain in much detail, Trickle will be a multibank savings and investment platform that would enable users save and invest while they spend.\n\nIn the medium term, a continental expansion seems to be in the works.\n\n\u201cRwanda would be our first destination; we already have arrangements for a licence there in the pipelines. We have also identified a few other markets, some in Francophone Africa others in Southern Africa.\u201d\n\nLast year, our trend analysis of Nigeria\u2019s fintech sector using insights from McKinsey and PwC, revealed that fintechs have largely focused on people already in the banking sector, and rarely released products to bring people into the financial sector.\n\nThis, however, reveals that there\u2019s still much room for growth.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish about this space. We believe that the current players have only scratched the surface and there is opportunity for innovation to go deeper and broader.\u201d Abimbola asserts.\n\nKredi\u2019s work might just turn out to be a first of many other companies looking to broaden the scope of digital banking in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "Makers of footwear in Aba, cars and other household consumables in South-Eastern Nigeria that depend on Onne Port, the gateway to the Eastern market, for the importation of raw materials are now facing hard times due to difficulties in clearing goods from the port.\n\nAccording to port users, imported containers now dwell for an average of 35 days at Onne Port due to the inefficiency of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and other government agencies involved in cargo clearing.\n\nThe situation, port users say, compels importers to pay millions of naira as demurrage and storage charges to shipping companies and terminal operators for not taking delivery of their containers as and when due.\n\n\u201cCargoes such as industrial chemicals, spare parts, Completely Knocked Down (CKD) kits for car assembling plants, raw materials like foreign leathers, chemicals, and shoe soles for footwear industries in Aba come into the country through Onne. I know of many footwear industries that bring in their raw materials from Onne Port,\u201d Tony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment, a clearing and forwarding company, said in an interview with BusinessDay.\n\nRead also: Stakeholders seek end to extortion, harassment on Nigeria roads\n\nAccording to Anakebe, all the Eastern markets including Onitsha Main Market, Ariaria International Market, and Nkwo Nnewi depend on Onne Port to bring in their goods.\n\nAnakebe, who noted that the major problem in Onne Port was the bad state of the access road, which has become a thorn in the flesh for port users, said there were other bottlenecks to the timely delivery of goods at the port.\n\n\u201cGovernment agencies are not helping, and there are multiple Customs units that also frustrate Ease of Doing Business at Onne. These Customs units have a way of delaying cargo clearing at the port, and Customs officers expect cargo owners to tip them before they would do their jobs, and this results in economic losses for cargo owners,\u201d he explained.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cThis situation results in a hike in inflation rate and prices of goods because these bottlenecks force importers to pay demurrages and storage charges. A manufacturer that would have pegged product pricing at N5 would be forced to charge N50 due to the delay and high charges at the port. The consumers would always be the ones to bear it by paying a premium for goods.\u201d\n\nWarredi Enisuoh, a seasoned ship captain, blamed the delay in cargo clearing at the port on the inability of Customs to change its inspection regime to match modern times.\n\nThe Customs needs to automate its processes, use scanners rather than physical inspection and modernise cargo movement at the port to fast track delivery of cargo, he said.\n\nNoah Sheriff, commercial manager of the West African Container Terminal (WACT), told newsmen at the Onne Port in Rivers State recently that the 35-day long dwell time for containers was hampering efficiency at the Onne Port.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to consignees to take prompt delivery of their containers to reduce the dwell time, which has risen to 35 days,\u201d he said, disclosing that the company was considering an additional investment of $111 million, a show of commitment to national revenue generation.\n\nBusinessDay check shows that this delay in cargo clearing is coming one year after WACT, Onne terminal operator, injected about $100 million into the acquisition of terminal handling equipment and expansion of the terminal yard in 2020.\n\nOn why cargo dwells longer, John Oforbike, a licensed customs agent, said despite the Federal Government\u2019s Executive Order on Ease of Doing Business at ports, doing business at the port remained very difficult due to lack of enforcement of the order.\n\nAccording to Oforbike, port terminals are supposed to be transit points for cargo; rather, they have become a detention bay for government agencies that interfere in the release of containers for one reason or the other.",

          "title": "Days after COP26 deal, oil producers angle to pump more",
          "text": "While the ink on which the climate change agreement was written has barely dried, oil producers gathered at a conference in Abu Dhabi are angling to pump more crude oil to achieve what they call energy security.\n\nOne failure of COP 26 was the inability of parties to reach an agreement on eliminating subsidies for fossil fuel. The proposal was killed by Russia, Australia, and Saudi Arabia, the countries mounting a full-throated defence for oil at the conference.\n\nHosted by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), ADIPEC is the world\u2019s most influential meeting place where oil, gas and energy companies and professionals engage and identify the opportunities that will unlock new value in the energy landscape.\n\nUnlike in Glasgow, at ADIPEC, the industry\u2019s largest gathering has no place for climate campaigners and anti-fossil fuel advocates. It was a gathering where some of the biggest oil producers announced big plans for new oil fields.\n\nSultan al-Jaber, CEO, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, in his opening address said some $600 billion would need to be spent by the oil industry every year through 2030 just to keep up with expected consumption levels.\n\nRead Also: Oil price falls after petrol stocks drop more than expected\n\n\u201cAfter almost a decade of under-investment in our industry, the world has sleep-walked into a supply crunch. It is time to wake up,\u201d Jaber said. \u201cYes, renewable energy is the fastest growing segment of the energy mix, but oil and gas is still the biggest and will be for decades to come. In short, the future is coming, but it is not here yet.\u201d\n\nAl-Jaber also represented the UAE at the COP26 talks as the country\u2019s special envoy for climate change. The UAE will also host the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UNFCCC.\n\nOn his part, Hardeep Singh Puri, the Indian oil minister, said his country, one of the world\u2019s major drivers for demand, was in great need of affordable energy, largely in the form of fossil fuels.\n\nAt COP26, India, China and a few others torpedoed the proposal to phase out coal. The negotiators in Glasgow spent nights agonising how to word the deal in a language that captures a compromise that works for all. They ended up with \u2018Phase down\u2019 of coal.\n\nMele Kyari, NNPC group managing director, in an interview at ADIPEC, was full of praise for Nigeria\u2019s new regulation that had brought fiscal and regulatory clarity and which was now driving financing towards new oil and gas investments in the deep-water space.\n\n\u201cOur partners are coming in to invest particularly in the deep water, and efforts are going on to bring out all the production we have lost,\u201d said Kyari.\n\nOn energy transition, he said the challenge was raising financing to improve gas production and consumption. Nigeria considers gas as its transition fuel and has released a swath of new policies designed to encourage investment into gas.\n\nAt COP26, Nigeria committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2016 partly based on the condition that rich countries will meet their requirement to contribute $100 billion yearly to help vulnerable countries including Nigeria, finance the mitigation of climate change impacts.\n\nRich nations agreed to ramp up financial support for developing nations but failed to create an adaptation fund for this purpose contrary to the expectation of developing nations.\n\n\u201cThe transition will have to be managed in a pragmatic way,\u201d Puri said in his remarks to ADIPEC. \u201cThe transition will need to take into account the precise requirements on how it affects the larger consuming countries.\u201d\n\nIndia has pledged to bring its carbon emissions down to net zero by 2070, while Saudi Arabia says it would do the same by 2060 and the UAE by 2050, even as both oil producers are spending billions on expanding their crude output capacity.\n\nOil producers at COP events are quick to rehash their climate commitments and pledges to invest more in renewables but when the rubber hits the road, they queue behind fossil fuels.\n\nThe same is true of international oil companies who were denied the opportunity to make speeches at COP26. Their acknowledgement that climate change presents existential threat to humanity has done little to dent their thirst for crude.\n\nNicolas Terraz, president of oil major TotalEnergies, said that due to natural reservoir depletion, the industry has to find some 4 million per day of new production capacity annually just to serve a 100 million per day market that is expected to rise along with the world population.\n\nEstimates of peak oil demand vary from the 2030s to the 2050s and beyond, but no matter the scenario, \u201cwe need a lot of investment to meet that demand because of that [natural production] decline,\u201d Terraz said.\n\nSome of the executives said the current gas supply squeeze in Europe should serve as a lesson for the world in not keeping up with demand growth.\n\nThey warned that energy transition presents a big risk and needs to be managed so as not to harm their economies. In the short-term, the oil cartel, OPEC and its allies said they would continue to manage the oil market to lay the groundwork for the investment needed to sustain production to meet demand.",

          "text": "The number of Nigerian students seeking admission in US universities dipped by 6.5 percent in 2020/2021, the lowest in three years, a BusinessDay analysis of new admission data shows.\n\nAccording to the Open Doors Report, published by the Washington-based Institute of International Education (IIE), the enrolment rate from Nigeria declined to 12,860 in the 2020/21 academic year from 13,762; 13,423, and 12,693 in 2019/20, 2018/19 and 2017/18 academic year, respectively.\n\nAnalysts attribute the decline to foreign exchange (FX) scarcity and difficulty in sourcing FX, thus making tuition fees expensive.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising because the difficulty in sourcing for FX, volatility in the exchange rate, and uncertainty that persists in the exchange rate environment have made it too difficult to pay school fees,\u201d Moses Ojo, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says.\n\nOjo states that over the past three years, there have been quite a few parents who have withdrawn their children studying in the US and other countries, and enrolling them into Nigeria\u2019s private universities.\n\nSince the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa\u2019s biggest economy that depends on oil proceeds has been riddled with weak foreign inflows, resulting in a liquidity challenge in the country\u2019s FX market.\n\nLast year, the Central Bank of Nigeria devalued the naira twice from N306/$ to N361/$, and N379/$, weakening the value of the naira against the dollar.\n\nMore recently, the apex bank officially adopted the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange (NAFEX) rate, which further weakened the naira by 8.2 percent to N410.25/$.\n\nWith the rising cost of dollars, it has become expensive to study in the US. International students pay between $32,000 and $60,000 per year, depending on the university and the course, according to International Education Financial Aid.\n\nRead also: SI-UK Nigeria to facilitate on spot offers into UK Universities\n\n\u201cWhen the FX rate is going up, it means that the ability of people to afford it reduces. So, school fees are now becoming more expensive for people to afford,\u201d Ayodele Akinwunmi, senior relationship manager \u2013 corporate banking group, FSDH Merchant Bank, states.\n\nThe report also states that globally, Nigeria moved up by one place, ranking 10th position from its previous ranking of 11th among the countries with the highest number of students in America, while China, India, South Korea, Canada and Saudi Arabia are the top five countries.\n\nBefore the drop, the number of Nigerian students studying in the US has increased steadily since the 2011/2012 academic year from 7,028 to 13,762 in 2019/20.\n\nEducation experts say this steady increase in the outflow of Nigerian students seeking post-secondary education abroad is due to the failure of Nigeria\u2019s public university system to adequately address multiple problems such as access, quality, funding, strikes, cultism, and stability of the academic calendar.\n\n\u201cThe simple answer that I have is that people will go for value no matter the cost because they can afford it. Nigeria has many rich people who can afford American education for their children. If we fail to provide value at home, people will go out for it,\u201d Akin Benjamin, a Lagos-based education consultant, says in a phone interview.\n\nHe adds, \u201cIf you can send your child to a private university in Nigeria, chances are that you can afford education abroad as well.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, budgetary allocation to education has not been more than 7 percent of its total budget. It is no wonder that the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said the country has 13 million children out of school, the highest in the world.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s performance in human capital development has not been impressive. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the country dropped three positions, ranking 161 in 2019 from 158 in 2018 among 189 countries in Human Development.\n\n\u201cThe education sector is facing the problem of incompetent teachers and unserious students. It is also facing the problem of dilapidated infrastructure,\u201d Peter Okebukola, former executive secretary of the National Universities Commission, said.\n\nInternational student mobility data are crucial to the world\u2019s largest economy\u2019s higher education professionals looking to make informed decisions as they work to internationalise their campuses.\n\nThey enrich the US universities and communities with unique perspectives and experiences that expand the horizons of American students and make US institutions more competitive in the global economy.",

Mr Bello said the injured victims are receiving treatment at health facilities and in their houses.\n\nHe said the gunmen raided Illela town and at least seven villages in the suburbs.\n\nAccording to his spokesperson, Mr Tambuwal also condemned the activities of illegal vigilante groups in the areas, warning that the government will not tolerate their lawlessness.\n\nHe said the governor, however, commended the security forces and registered volunteer groups complimenting the efforts of the security agencies.\n\nGoronyo and Illela are among council areas where the state government has shut down telecommunications networks and banned weekly markets to curb the activities of bandits.\n\nHowever, reprisal attacks involving bandits and vigilante groups have intensified in Sokoto.\n\nBandits have been reported to have established administration in many rural communities in the state, imposing taxes on villagers.\n\nAs Tambuwal visits locations, Buhari condemns killings\n\nEarlier, President Buhari had condemned the killings in Sokoto State.\n\nReacting to the incident from South Africa through his media aide, Garba Shehu, Mr Buhari said, \u201cthis needless and mindless violence against innocent people cannot go unpunished.\u201d\n\nThe president also sympathised with the victims of the attacks and urged the security forces to redouble their efforts in fighting the criminality.\n\n\u201cThis persistent and unprovoked violence against unarmed civilians must be met with fierce response by the government.\n\n\u201cLet me once again, reassure Nigerians, that this administration will not abandon them to their fate in the face of this existential challenge caused by banditry.\u201d\n\nAccording to the president, \u201cwe are taking delivery of military equipment to improve the capacity of our security forces to effectively deal with this issue.\n\n\u201cOur military is also deploying advanced technology to enhance surveillance and related operations to locate and crush these criminals and enemies of our common humanity.\n\n\u201cThis administration will not tolerate this state of affairs where criminals deprive the people of their means of livelihood and turn them into beggars and refugees.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are living in a fool\u2019s paradise if they believe that they can\u2019t be crushed.

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nContinuous spike in food prices could push additional six million Nigerians into poverty, the World Bank has said.\n\nIn a publication titled, \u2018COVID-19 in Nigeria: Frontline Data and Pathways for Policy, the global lender said, \u201cThe rise in prices witnessed between June 2020 and June 2021 alone could push another 6 million Nigerians into poverty, with urban areas being disproportionately affected.\u201d\n\nThis is coming on the heels of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report on Monday, saying that the annual food inflation rate rose for the 24th consecutive month to 20.75 per cent in October from 20.71 per cent in September as a result of further increases in the prices of basic food items.\n\nIn its Consumer Price Index, CPI and Inflation Report for October 2021, NBS noted that \u201cThis rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of food products, coffee, tea and cocoa, milk, cheese and eggs, bread and cereals, vegetables and potatoes, yam and other tubers.\u201d Consequently, food inflation rate had risen by 7.38 percentage points since May 2019 when it dropped to 13.37 per cent.\n\nThe World Bank report added, \u201cThe share of Nigerians living below the national poverty line could have increased from 40.1 percent to 42.8 per cent, due to the food price inflation witnessed between June 2020 and June 2021. This means about 5.6 million additional Nigerians would be living in poverty.\n\nWhile food price inflation would decrease purchasing power and raise poverty across Nigeria, it appears that urban areas could be disproportionately affected. In 2018/19, about 16 percent of poor Nigerians were urban dwellers.\n\nYet among those who would be newly impoverished by the increase in food prices between June 2020 and June 2021, around 27 per cent would be from urban areas.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, while the first part of the COVID-19 crisis precipitated a global economic slowdown which caused a recession in Nigeria, the second crisis was characterized by surging inflation, putting further pressure on households\u2019 purchasing power.\n\nThe reported stated, \u201cIn April 2021, the year-on-year inflation rate was the highest in four years, and food prices accounted for over 60 per cent of the total increase in inflation.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in 2020 and 2021, Nigeria witnessed its highest surge in food-price inflation in almost two decades. This inflationary pressure stems from both supply and demand factors, many of which are directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\u201cOn the supply side, food production and market access may have been affected by the pandemic and by lockdown measures, compounding the effects of restrictive trade policies, including the closure of Nigeria\u2019s land border in August 2019.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, firms and households expect prices to rise during economic shocks and thus incorporate these expectations into their investment and consumption decisions.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank expressed concern that negative coping strategies could threaten welfare at the moment while having implications for the future.\n\nIt stated, \u201cFood insecurity may have long-run consequences for human capital, as child stunting in Nigeria was widespread even before the pandemic, and malnutrition can weaken children\u2019s capacity for learning.\n\nAlongside other immediate priorities for Nigeria, such as rolling out vaccines and recouping learning losses, scaling up social protection \u2013 including using innovative techniques to reach the poor \u2013 remains crucial for alleviating the effects of the COVID-19 crisis in the short, medium, and long run.\u201d\n\nThe bank added that lack of social protection exposed the citizens to large welfare losses, saying before the pandemic, less than 2 per cent of Nigerians lived in a household enrolled in the National Social Safety Net Project (NASSP) \u2013 and coverage of most other programs was even lower.\n\nThe World Bank called on the Nigerian authorities to, as a way of providing a bedrock for recovery, curb the spread of COVID-19 by rolling out vaccines quickly and equitably.\n\nIt also charged the government to put machinery in motion to recoup learning losses experienced during the first year of the pandemic, while expanding social protection to ease households\u2019 welfare losses, curtail longer-term consequences for human capital and livelihoods, and enable fiscal reforms.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s social protection programmes inadequate \u2013 World Bank",
          "text": "The World Bank has said that lack of social protection in Nigeria exposes its population to large welfare losses, noting that before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, less than 2 percent of Nigerians enrolled in the country\u2019s flagship social protection program, the National Social Safety Net Project (NASSP), and coverage of most other programs was even lower.\n\nThe Bank which made the observation in a report titled, \u201cThe COVID-19 crisis in Nigeria: what\u2019s happening to welfare?\u201d published on Tuesday, observed that coverage of social protection programs remained low throughout the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIt noted that between March 2020 and March 2021, just 4 percent of households had received support \u2013 in the form of cash \u2013 from the federal, state, or local government, which is significantly below what would be needed to counteract the widening and deepening of poverty brought about by the crisis.\n\nThe Bank noted that while the health impacts of COVID-19 have not spared Nigeria, which country recorded its first case of COVID-19 on February 27, 2020, and has subsequently suffered three distinct waves of infection, peaking in June 2020, January 2021, and August 2021, many of the primary effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the country have been economic, rather than health related.\n\nAccording to it, \u201cThe early part of the COVID-19 crisis ushered in Nigeria\u2019s deepest recession since the 1980s, with services and industry hit especially hard. This partly stemmed from lockdown measures restricting people\u2019s ability to go to work. On top of that, the price of oil \u2013 which represents more than 80 percent of Nigeria\u2019s exports and more than 50 percent of government revenues \u2013 tumbled more than 60 percent between February and May 2020.\n\n\u201cIn the later stages of the COVID-19 crisis, even though economic activity began to recover, inflation started to accelerate, especially for food items that are crucial for consumption among the poor and vulnerable. By disrupting markets, the crisis has exacerbated pre-existing structural distortions \u2013 including trade restrictions, such as the 2019 border closure \u2013 which were already driving up prices and eroding purchasing power, even before the pandemic struck.\u201d\n\nThe Bank noted that the pandemic threatens to compound Nigeria\u2019s poverty challenges, noting that even before Covid-19, around 4 in 10 Nigerians lived below the national poverty line, while multidimensional poverty was even more widespread.\n\n\u201cWhile health indicators and macroeconomic data are essential for addressing the fundamentals of the COVID-19 crisis, countervailing policies need detailed information on the mechanisms through which the pandemic affects human capital, livelihoods, and welfare. This is especially important in Nigeria because the pandemic threatens to compound the country\u2019s high levels of poverty: even before COVID-19, around 4 in 10 Nigerians lived below the national poverty line, and multidimensional poverty was even more widespread,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, this kind of detailed analysis is made possible by high-frequency data collected during the pandemic through the Nigeria COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (NLPS). This nationally-representative survey is distinctive in capturing key socioeconomic information from households for 12 consecutive rounds between April 2020 and April 2021: few other developing countries with which the World Bank has worked on phone surveys have such extensive data.\n\n\u201cA new report \u2013 COVID-19 in Nigeria: Frontline Data and Pathways for Policy \u2013 uses the NLPS to examine how the COVID-19 crisis has been affecting the human capital, livelihoods, and welfare of Nigerian households. Another forthcoming blog uses the NLPS data to explore the crisis\u2019 profound impacts on employment and education: households have been scrambling to boost their precarious incomes through additional work in small-scale non-farm enterprises, sometimes coming at the expense of education for young people. This blog considers the resulting welfare effects.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank noted that the Covid-19 crisis has been worsened by weak social protection in the country.\n\n\u201cThe lack of social protection in Nigeria exposes its population to large welfare losses. Before the pandemic struck, less than 2 percent of Nigerians lived in a household enrolled in the country\u2019s flagship social protection program \u2013 the National Social Safety Net Project (NASSP) \u2013 and coverage of most other programs was even lower. Coverage of social protection programs remained low throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Between March 2020 and March 2021, just 4 percent of households had received support \u2013 in the form of cash \u2013 from the federal, state, or local government. This is significantly below what would be needed to counteract the widening and deepening of poverty brought about by the crisis.\n\n\u201cGiven this lack of social assistance, Nigerian households have been adopting negative coping strategies in response to the shocks that have accompanied the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, households directly reported feeling the acceleration in prices observed in the macroeconomic data: around 82 percent of households reported that the price of major food items had increased between July 2020 and December 2020. The most widespread coping strategy was reducing food consumption: more than two-thirds of shock-hit households reduced their food consumption between April/May 2020 and July 2020. This was followed by additional borrowing and drawing down savings, which could place households on weaker financial footing.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, food insecurity increased when the COVID-19 crisis hit. In April/May 2020, at least one adult had skipped a meal (in the previous 30 days) in almost three-quarters of Nigerian households. This share had dropped to about 56 percent by November 2020 but was still significantly higher than what was observed prior to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNegative coping strategies threaten welfare today and have implications for the future. Food insecurity may have long-run consequences for human capital, as child stunting in Nigeria was widespread even before the pandemic, and malnutrition can weaken children\u2019s capacity for learning. Alongside other immediate priorities for Nigeria, such as rolling out vaccines and recouping learning losses, scaling up social protection \u2013 including using innovative techniques to reach the poor \u2013 remains crucial for alleviating the effects of the COVID-19 crisis in the short, medium, and long run.\u201d",

          "text": "About 11,000 workers of the Nigerian Railway Corporation have commenced a three-day warning strike, grounding operations at all rail stations across the country.\n\nThe NRC employees under the aegis of the Nigerian Union of Railway Workers on Wednesday vowed to halt all train operations nationwide including services on the popular Lagos-Ibadan, Abuja-Kaduna, and Warri-Itakpe routes today (Thursday).\n\nOther notable routes to be affected by the industrial action include Lagos-Kano, Kano-Unguru and Aba-Port Harcourt, with thousands of railway passengers expected to be stranded at stations across the country while about N90m revenue is expected to be lost to the three-day strike.\n\nLast week, the NUR, an affiliate of the Nigeria Labour Congress, threatened to embark on a three-day nationwide warning strike from November 18 to November 20, 2021 to press home their demands for improved welfare.\n\nIn a bid to avert the strike, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, held a meeting in Lagos on Saturday with the union, but it was gathered that the meeting ended in a deadlock.\n\nWhen asked by our correspondent on Wednesday if the strike had been shelved, the NUR President-General, Innocent Ajiji, replied in the negative and stressed that all railway workers would down tool as from 12am today (Thursday).\n\nIt was also gathered that government officials looked for the railway union leaders on Wednesday to serve a court injunction on the NUR not to begin the strike, but this was unsuccessful as key union officials went underground for the most part of the day.\n\nThe union leaders argued that a court injunction was not the solution against the planned strike.\n\n\u201cWe are going ahead with the strike on Thursday. They have been trying to get us to serve us a court injunction. That is the kind of government we have in place now. However, we\u2019ve not been served and so by early hours of Thursday morning our strike commences,\u201d Ajiji stated.\n\nAsked to state the number of workers who would partake in the strike, he replied, \u201cAbout 11,000 workers. We have 10,995 workers, so we are about 11,000 approximately.\u201d\n\nOn whether the strike would affect all the rail stations in Nigeria, Ajiji said, \u201cYes. The Abuja-Kaduna, Lagos-Ibadan, Warri-Itakpe, Lagos-Kano, Kano-Unguru and Aba-Port Harcourt, all those trains will stop. And even our offices will be closed down.\n\n\u201cAnd apart from those who operate the movement of the trains, we have local workshop workers, tracks men, admin department, everywhere will be closed down!\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that the sector would lose about N90m during the three-day warning strike and that if the demands of the workers were not met, the union might declare another industrial action nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe make over N360m monthly from the rail sector. We generate over N30m daily,\u201d Ajiji said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis strike will cause a drop in revenue for the sector. But that is not the issue. Rather the issue is that government should listen to our just demands.\u201d\n\nOn whether the minister had reached out to the workers after the Saturday meeting that was deadlocked, the NUR president said, \u201cHe has not said anything till today.\n\n\u201cWe will be at the stations by 6am on Thursday and this is because in Abuja, for instance, the first train moves by 7am. So we must be there by 6am to stop the train from moving.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of Transportation, Eric Ojekwe, said he could not speak on the matter. Also, the spokesperson for NRC, Yakub Mahmood, declined to make any comment when contacted. Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The crisis within the All Progressives Congress (APC) may not abate any soon as dozens of armed policemen in four patrol vans were Wednesday drafted to man the entry and exit points of its national secretariat, otherwise known as Buhari House, on Blantyre Street, Wuse 2 Abuja.\n\nBlueprint learnt that the national leadership of the ruling party was acting on a tip-off of a planned protest by some aggrieved party members.\n\nApart from policemen, personnel of the Directorate of Security Services (DSS) were also seen strategically around the party house.\n\nIt was gathered that as early as 11:30 am, security was tightened as all roads leading to the party secretariat were barricaded and armed policemen were seen conducting searches on humans and vehicles moving towards the party Secretariat.\n\nPatrol vehicles were strategically positioned at both Valencia Hotel and Barcelona Hotel ends of Blantyre Street, while another van was positioned directly behind the secretariat along Ibrahim Babangida Way to forestall any attempt for the protesters to gain easy access into the secretariat.\n\nAt about 1.30 pm, personnel of the DSS Special Force, on a patrol van and power bikes were seen patrolling along Blantyre Street to provide additional security backups.\n\nBlueprint also learnt that all the measures were put in place to frustrate an alleged plan by some aggrieved leaders of the party to cause chaos through protest at the Buhari House.\n\nA security source at the APC secretariat said: \u201cWe had security report that some people have plans to come and protest here. The national leadership had to order the deployment of police and other security agencies to forestall any breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cThis is the second time we are seeing this kind of deployment at the secretariat. It showed that some party members are aggrieved and there is a limit to what they can do to continue to stop the protesters. The committee should also know that they have overstayed their welcome and should be ready to conduct the National Convention. They cannot be there forever. From six months to one year and still counting.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s mere routine check \u2013 Party\n\nBut when contacted for official comments, National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) John James Akpanudoedehe, told newsmen that the heavy presence of the security men was a mere routine check to protect lives and property.\n\n\u201cOh, nothing is happening. They have been there several times whenever we need to safeguard the secretariat. You are not in a position to read security reports.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that have to do with security that you are not aware of. It\u2019s a routine thing. We have to protect the people who work here, we read security reports and I\u2019m sure you are fully aware we have every security agency in our secretariat. We are only acting on security reports, there is no cause for alarm,\u201d Akpanudoedehe stated.\n\nMarafa on \u2018expulsion plan\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa has dismissed the threat by APC caretaker committee to expel him from the party for expressing reservations on the legality of the committee and its activities, describing it as an empty threat.\n\nMarafa, who represented Zamfara Central Senatorial District in the eight National Assembly, had Sunday, threatened to institute a legal action against the committee Chairman and Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni over what he called the violation of the party\u2019s constitution in the conduct of the party\u2019s affairs.\n\nThe caretaker committee through its Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudodehe, had Monday, warned Marafa to submit to party supremacy or be sanctioned.\n\nReacting to the threat through a statement Wednesday in Abuja, Marafa said he cannot be silenced by the threat of the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cExpelling me from the party will only aggravate the problem. It will herald the beginning of the agitation; rule of law must be respected. The committee is an illegality and alien to the constitution of the party. We are building everything on nothing. Rather than the expulsion threat, the committee or the chairman should respond to issues I raised.\n\n\u201cWhat our party constitution says that rendered Buni-committee null and void.\n\n\u201cSection 17 (4) of the constitution of our beloved party, says \u2018 no officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently. Article 20 states the only way the leadership of the party can evolve.\n\n\u201cSection 13.3(iv) which was relied upon to create the illegal body called CECPC talked about the power of NEC to create committees.\n\n\u201cAPC is a political party not a committee, committees are created to serve a specific functions not to usurp the powers of the entire legal entity. The function of the Mai Mala committee is to plan a convention just as its name implies, Mai Mala is the chairman of the APC Convention Planning Committee and not APC itself,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe former Senator added that \u201cSection 12.3 lists the party\u2019s NEC members and it made the National Chairman of the party and NOT the chairman of any committee by whatever name as the chairman of the organ while section 12.3 (xxxi) list the president and vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as members only, so the question is; who approved the constitution and subsequent extensions of tenure of office of the illegal and obnoxious CECPC?\n\n\u201cWe will show him the way out dishonourably. We would not allow the party we contributed immensely to develop to be destroyed by overambitious self-centred and enemies of the party, and the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the party we laboured, toiled and laid the foundation for its success. We will not allow those who have little or no stake in the party to destroy it or to please certain individuals and achieve their selfish interest,\u201d he said.\n\nMarafa, while insisting that he has committed no offence, said the party should revert to the path of constitutionality and rule of law or face extinction.\n\nAPC won\u2019t descent low with Marafa \u2013Scribe\n\nAnd in its response, the party said Marafa can abuse any of its leaders but they won\u2019t go low with the former lawmaker.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen on the telephone Wednesday, the CCEPC scribe, Senator Akpanudoedehe, said APC is an institution which nobody can drag to the gutter.\n\n\u201cWe are not abusive to any member of our party; we are too mature to go into personal response. Our interest is in general public and then the party. We are not going to go back and forth with anybody. Any information that is giving out, we are duty bound to respond by stating the fact as it is.\n\n\u201cI will not descend to the level where Marafa talks and I reply, I\u2019m not going to do that. I have never been personal with anybody, he can abuse me, my duty is to explain to the public, my interest is to give balanced information for the public to see whether we are saying the truth or not. That\u2019s all; we are not going to enter into personal tirade of words. Nobody can drag me or the party to the gutter, we are an institution. They are not dealing with an individual but an institution,\u201d he said.",

However, at the time of the Governor\u2019s visit Wednesday afternoon the toll has risen to 43.\n\nA District Head in one of the of the five villages, Kamalo, Munwadata, Sarwa, Runji and Masada. that were attacked during the midnight raid, was wounded.\n\nGov Tambuwal during the visit to Illela town told his bereaved audience that: \u201cWe\u2019re here to, on behalf of the government and good people of our dear state, to extend our heartfelt condolences on this unfortunate incident which claimed the lives of many of our citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is not a small occurrence. It is upsetting,\u201d he stated, emphasizing that: \u201cthis incident really touched us.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended the local government authorities, monarchs and community leaders for their lawful composition of a volunteer group working in tandem with the security operatives in the area.\n\nHe said the state government \u201cwill continue to frown upon the constitution of illegitimate volunteers,\u201d pointing out that \u201cthe joint operations of legitimately constituted volunteers, who work closely with and under the supervision of security agencies, is the appropriate antidote to this crisis.\n\nHe appealed to the people of the area not to be daunted by the recent attack. \u201cInstead, it should motivate you all to redouble your efforts, without seeking revenge, in securing your communities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Governor assured them of sustained government assistance \u201cwhenever required\u201d, while praying for the repose of the souls of the deceased.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, pray that God grant them eternal glory and forgive their shortcomings and sins while they were alive. May He also grant their families and relatives the fortitude to bear the losses of those who died just as we besiege Him to grant health and relief to those who sustained injuries and are recuperating at home and in the hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe again pray to God to continue to ensure that peace prevails in all our communities and across the country.\n\n\u201cI, once again, urge you to be patient and prayerful. I am delighted with the communal efforts at cooperation and prayers, led by the monarchs and community leaders here, being offered for the intercession of God in bringing us peace. Please, do not relent. May Allah grant us peace and peaceful coexistence,\u201d he prayed profusely.",

          "text": "Chinese coast guard ships blocked and sprayed a powerful stream of water at two Philippine boats carrying supplies to troops at a disputed South China Sea shoal, prompting Manila to order Beijing\u2019s ships to back off and warn that its supply vessels are covered by a mutual defense treaty with the United States, Manila\u2019s top diplomat said Thursday.\n\nPhilippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said no one was hurt in the incident on Tuesday, but the two supply ships had to abort their mission to provide food to Filipino forces occupying Second Thomas Shoal, which lies off western Palawan province in the Philippines\u2019 internationally recognized exclusive economic zone.\n\nLocsin said in a tweet that the three Chinese coast guard ships\u2019 actions were illegal and urged them \u201cto take heed and back off.\u201d\n\nIt was the latest flare-up in the long-simmering territorial disputes in the strategic waterway, where China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have overlapping claims. China claims virtually the entire South China Sea and has transformed seven shoals into missile-protected island bases to cement its assertions, ratcheting up tensions and alarming rival claimants and Western governments led by the U.S.\n\nThe Philippine government conveyed to China \u201cour outrage, condemnation and protest of the incident,\u201d Locsin said, adding that \u201cthis failure to exercise self-restraint threatens the special relationship between the Philippines and China\u201d that President Rodrigo Duterte and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, worked to nurture.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China\u2019s coast guard had upheld China\u2019s sovereignty after the Philippine ships entered Chinese waters at night without permission.\n\nNational Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon told reporters in Manila that two Chinese coast guard ships blocked the two wooden-hulled supply vessels. A third coast guard ship \u201cwater cannoned the two for one hour,\u201d he said, adding that the outrigger of one of the Philippine ships was displaced by the impact.\n\nA water cannon is a device on firetrucks that shoots high-velocity water for firefighting and crowd control but has also been installed on Chinese coast guard ships to drive away what China considers intruders in the waters it claims.\n\nThe Philippines plans to deploy coast guard and Bureau of Fisheries vessels instead of navy ships to back up its forces and enforce its fishing laws at Second Thomas Shoal, which Filipinos call Ayungin and China refers to as the Ren\u2019ai reef, Esperon said.\n\nThe number of Chinese surveillance ships has increased in recent weeks in the far-flung shoal and also around Thitu, a larger Philippine-occupied island in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea\u2019s most hotly contested area, he said.\n\nPhilippine forces won\u2019t be deterred from traveling again to the shoal following the incident, he said.\n\n\u201cWe will continue the resupply and we do not have to ask the permission of anybody because that is within our territory,\u201d Esperon said.\n\nThe Philippine military deliberately ran aground a World War II-era warship, the BRP Sierra Madre, at the submerged shoal in 1999 to fortify its claim and provide a shelter to a small contingent of Filipino marines.\n\nThe Sierra Madre is now effectively a rusty shipwreck but the Philippine military has not decommissioned it. That makes the ship an extension of the government and means any attack on the ship is tantamount to an assault against the Philippines.\n\nIn 2014, the Philippine military invited more than a dozen journalists, including from The Associated Press, on a resupply mission to the shoal in a bid to draw global attention to what Philippine officials have called China\u2019s bullying tactics.\n\nTwo Chinese coast guard ships then tried to block the slow-moving, military-chartered vessel carrying the journalists, with one cutting dangerously through the Philippine ship\u2019s path twice. The Chinese coast guard warned the Philippine vessel by radio to turn back, saying it was illegally venturing into Chinese territory.\n\nThe Chinese ships blew their horns intimidatingly, but the boat managed to maneuver toward the Sierra Madre through shallow waters dotted with rocky coral outcrops, preventing the Chinese ship from pursuing.\n\nWashington has no claims in the busy waterway but has patrolled the region with its Navy ships and aircraft to assure its allies, including the Philippines, and protect freedom of navigation and overflight. China has repeatedly warned the U.S. to stay away from the disputed waters and not meddle in what it says is a regional issue.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have repeatedly assured the Philippines that the U.S. will honor its obligation under the nations\u2019 Mutual Defense Treaty if Philippine forces, ships or aircraft come under attack in the region.",

          "title": "Under Pressure, Apple Allows Self-repairs to iPhones, Macs",
          "text": "Apple is letting some iPhone users fix their own phones, a sharp turnaround for a company that has long prohibited anyone but company-approved technicians from fiddling with its proprietary parts and software.\n\nThe company said Wednesday that it will enable users of two of the newest iPhone models and eventually some Mac computers to get access to genuine Apple parts and tools for consumer repairs.\n\nThe shift reflects a strengthening \u201cright to repair\u201d movement embraced by President Joe Biden and affecting everything from smartphones to cars and tractors. It\u2019s a reaction to the infusion of software into more everyday products and the practices of manufacturers who have increasingly made those products difficult and expensive to repair.\n\nApple is launching an online store for self-service repairs early next year that it says will have more than 200 individual parts and tools for making the most common repairs on the iPhone 12 or iPhone 13. It will initially be focused on do-it-yourself fixes to screens, batteries and displays, which Apple previously resisted and cited concerns about security and safety, such as faulty battery replacements that can damage a device.\n\nApple\u2019s action is welcome news for consumers and a sign that similar standards should apply to other electronics, said Maureen Mahoney, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports.\n\n\u201cIf you buy a product, you should be able to fix it,\u201d she said. Otherwise \u201cconsumers have to either rely on the manufacturers\u2019 authorized repairer or they have to buy a new one.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission, the Biden administration and state legislatures have been eyeing regulatory changes that would make it easier for Americans to repair their broken devices.\n\nRegulators have expressed concerns about restrictions that steer consumers into manufacturers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 repair networks, adding costs to consumers and shutting out independent repair shops from business opportunities. They\u2019ve also said those repair restrictions often fall heavily on minority and low-income consumers. An FTC report to Congress in May noted that many Black-owned small businesses make equipment repairs, and repair shops often are owned by entrepreneurs from poor communities.\n\nApple has long been a target for right-to-repair advocates because of its practice of locking down its software so that parts are encoded to a specific device. Some attempted repairs \u2014 such as replacing a broken original screen with one made by a third party \u2014 have left phones unusable.\n\nThere are limits to the changes that Apple is making but it\u2019s still \u201ca big milestone,\u201d said Nathan Proctor, senior director for the Right to Repair campaign at U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group.\n\n\u201cOne of the most visible right-to-repair opponents is reversing course in a meaningful way,\u201d he said.\n\nProctor said that\u2019s thanks to growing pressure, including from some of Apple\u2019s own investors. A shareholder proposal from an environmentally minded investment group calls for the company to cease its anti-repair practices, arguing that they are contributing to electronic waste.",
