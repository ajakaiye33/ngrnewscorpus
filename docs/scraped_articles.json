          "title": "South-East govs, leaders meet Buhari\u2019s envoys, list grievances",
          "text": "A delegation from the Federal Government and leaders from the South-East, on Friday, met behind closed doors to discuss insecurity and other issues affecting the region.\n\nThe meeting comes less than 24 hours after the President, Major General Muhammdu Buhari (retd.), threatened tougher military sanctions against secessionists.\n\nIn the meeting that lasted several hours at the Enugu State Government House, the South-East leaders aired several grievances affecting the region, including marginalisation and attacks by herders. The Federal Government\u2019s delegation was led by the Defence Minister, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd).\n\nMagashi admitted that the herder crisis should be treated as a national issue, noting that the leadership of the South-East and the Federal Government would engage in discussion on the complaints of the leaders of the zone.\n\nHe said, \u201cHaving told them the purpose of being here and having listened to us, we discussed the issue and agreed on the following:\n\n\u201cThat the South-East and South-West governors are committed to the unity and stability of this great country. And we are giving them the assurance and confidence that this commitment will be relayed to the Federal Government and, in fact, the Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\u201cIssues raised included the instability and criminality affecting the country in general. And we were happy to discuss the ones that are peculiar to this part of the country. We have agreed that there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed. I will just mention one or two for your consumption; one, the herders\u2019 conflict should be seen from the perspective of national interest that should be given the necessary accord to stop the menace all over the country.\n\n\u201cSecond, we discussed the problem of marginalisation which I think was well accepted. But further discussions will continue after we have met with Mr President to study the grievances and after the governors articulate their positions, then we can hold further discussions on it.\n\n\u201cWe have also talked about community policing which is invoked now in Nigeria by state governments and we are of the opinion that community policing by the South-East governors should be encouraged because we have already set precedence in Amotekun in the Western part of the country.\u201d\n\nResponding on behalf of the South-East leaders, the Chairman, South-East Governors\u2019 Forum, Chief David Umahi, commended the delegation, describing it as a new dawn for the country.\n\nThe Ebonyi State governor said, \u201cOur people are very much excited with this commitment and we are very much satisfied. It is a new dawn, not only in the South-East, but also in entire Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the issue of the ban on open grazing and, of course, this delegation is in support of the ban. We also informed this delegation that each of the states of South-East has laws in this respect.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has committed towards addressing all issues pertaining herdsmen matters in the South-East. We have also agreed to articulate our grievances, our concerns and position of Ndigbo as spelt out by Ohanaeze for further discussion.\u201d\n\nUmahi stressed that \u201cthe Ebubeagu security outfit is the only recognised local security outfit in the South-East,\u201d adding \u201cno other security outfit is speaking for South-East and this is the position of Ndigbo.\u201d\n\nHe said the South-East people were committed to a united Nigeria where justice, fairness, equality of freedom and equity are guaranteed.\n\nThose who attended the meeting included the governors of Abia and Imo states, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu and Senator Hope Uzodinma, respectively; Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Dr Nkem Okeke; the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Uchechukwu Ogah; President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Amb George Obiozor; former President of the Senate, Senator Ken Nnamani; Senator Ike Ekweramadu; Deputy Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Toby Okechukwu; Speaker of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Edward Ubosi; former governor of old Enugu State, Dr Okwesilieze Nwodo; Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyawu; Chief Nnia Nwodo; and the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, South-East, Bishop Goddy Okafor.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Abacha\u2019s regime offered mum so much but she chose the right path for her country \u2013Jamiu, MKO Abiola\u2019s son",
          "text": "Jamiu Abiola, a son of the late Chief Moshood Abiola and Mrs Kudirat Abiola, who was assassinated on June 4, 1996, during the military regime of the late General Sani Abacha, shares with TOBI AWORINDE how his family is honouring her memory 25 years after\n\nYou just started a foundation in your mother\u2019s honour 25 years after her death. Why is this the right time?\n\nYes, I did and this is the right time for so many reasons. The Kudirat Abiola Sabon Gari Peace Foundation is being established at a time when Nigeria needs peace more than anything else. There are so many forces trying to break the country. This is ironic because we live in a world where advanced countries are keen on coming together. Lack of accurate information has generated false perceptions and suspicion, which is the source of continuous avoidable conflicts. Our foundation will tackle this void by being actively involved in conflict resolution so that these agitators can have a rethink and retrace their steps.\n\nHaving just marked the 25th memorial, do you think your mother has been given her due recognition by the government as your father was very recently?\n\nThe government named her a martyr of Nigeria\u2019s democracy in the Women Hall of Fame. I am hopeful that more will be done for this young woman who gave up her life and her children for Nigeria to be a democratic country. It is only when such people receive their well-earned recognition that others would be encouraged to go the extra mile for Nigeria. Nigeria needs many more people like her in order to be great again.\n\nConsidering her fight for democracy during one of the most difficult times in Nigeria\u2019s history, what are some lessons the country can learn today?\n\nThe biggest lesson to learn from her struggle is that we are all going to die one day. So bearing this in mind, try to be as good as you can and as selfless as you can. Some other people died in that period and the legacy they left behind is horrific. My mother could have sold out on the struggle and today be living like a queen shuttling between Europe and Africa. The Abacha government offered her so much but she chose the right path for her country and herself in the hereafter. If only 30 per cent of the Nigerian elite were like her, this country by now would have been singing a different tune. Eventually, we will be forced to learn the hard way if we choose to remain mute, which is what is happening now.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the state of democracy in Nigeria with regard to the calls for restructuring?\n\nThe calls for restructuring are loud but what I think its advocates should do is to at least recognise that a form of restructuring is actually taking place today. As you know, the Federal Government is promoting judicial and local government autonomy. To me, these are steps that should take place before a country can be ready for restructuring. With regard to the state of democracy, I think that the burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission has put it in danger. There is a plan to ensure that no voting takes place in certain parts of the country.\n\nCan you recount the moment she was murdered and how that impacted you?\n\nWhen it happened, I was living in New York (United States). I received a call around 6am, New York time, and the wife of my father\u2019s American top aide told me what had happened. After hearing the news, I experienced what can be described as the longest day of my life. Its impact was as devastating as a nuclear bomb would have been if it had fallen on my head. But as luck would have it, four of my siblings were in the US, so within 15 hours, we were all assembled in Virginia. This helped mitigate the disastrous effect as we were able to pick up the pieces as a team. That was when we took a vow to never let the world separate the seven of us.\n\nHow did your father cope with her death?\n\nThere is no way we would have known then, but just one day before he died, the military government of Abdulsalami (Abubakar) allowed some of his family members to see him. My brother and I had come 39 days after my mother had died but Abacha refused to let us see him. We even went to General (Oladipo) Diya, who was Abacha\u2019s deputy but he said getting involved would make Abacha think he was on our side. After my father\u2019s death, though, we learned that he greatly suffered from what had happened to my mother. He spoke of some people giving him a newspaper article featuring details of her death and leaving him alone to console himself. In one of his letters, just before his death, he named her the \u2018Mother of June 12.\u2019\n\nDo you think the trajectory of the nation would have changed significantly with your father assuming office as President in 1993?\n\nYes, but not because he was a superman but because of that period. That was an era of global growth, a sort of golden age. His tragedy was a missed national opportunity because even a mediocre democratic government at that time would have flourished. Aside from that, we never link things together in Nigeria. To date, lots of people think my parents struggled because they were ambitious. But when you look at how much the transition had cost at that time and what would have happened if that wasted money was put into agriculture three decades ago, then you would know that these misguided elements causing so much havoc in Niger State, for example, would have been legally engaged in something long ago. Most of the havoc today can be directly traced to the annulment of June 12 and the murder of my parents.\n\nThose who were convicted for your mother\u2019s murder in 2012 have since been acquitted by an Appeal Court. How did that make you feel?\n\nIn most cases, being disappointed is as a result of expecting so much. After what had happened to my parents, I did not really believe in the system of this country. So, I was not so devastated, but the worst point was that my mother\u2019s death was used as a bargaining tool to recover looted funds as if what had happened to her and her children was not bad enough.\n\nThe Lagos State Government has approached the Supreme Court to overturn the Appeal Court verdict on your mother\u2019s death. Do you have hope that there will be justice?\n\nThere will be justice because God never forgets. I don\u2019t know whether it will come from the Supreme Court, though. She was reading the Qur\u2019an when she was shot and her blood spilled on it. God will certainly bring these people to their knees and make them regret.\n\nLateef Shofolahan had argued that none of your mother\u2019s children could identify him as a domestic staff, so he couldn\u2019t have been working for her at the time she was killed. What do you say to that?\n\nMost of us were in the US and the ones who should have been able to recognise him were just eight and nine years old when our mother died. He was not a member of the domestic staff because he was employed in the campaign office. It was later that he began coming to the house.\n\nWhat will it take for your family to find closure on the matter of your mother\u2019s assassination?\n\nIt would be nice if these criminals could be made to pay for their crimes. However, we have moved on. Why should we let such hopeless people hold us down?\n\nWhat are some things you can point to as your mother\u2019s lasting legacy?\n\nHer lasting legacy was fighting for justice and relief for the poor and weak. The night before her murder, she was distributing foodstuffs at an orphanage and when she got hit, she was reading the Qur\u2019an. What a wonderful way to exit this world. My sister set up the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy to empower women and, now, I have set up the Kudirat Abiola Sabon Gari Peace Foundation. She might be dead but her vision lives on. So, it is true that a person can be killed, but certainly not the person\u2019s soul or vision.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A native doctor, Rafiu Afolabi, has narrated how Christopher Akpan, the fianc\u00e9 of an officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Josephine Onche, allegedly killed the woman for money ritual.\n\nAfolabi, a 67-year-old man from Saki, Oyo State, said after killing Onche, Akpan offered him N5m to silence him but said he was only given N50,000.\n\nAfolabi narrated the story after operatives of the Intelligence Response Team of the Nigeria Police Force recently arrested him and Akpan for alleged murder.\n\nOnche\u2019s family on December 20, 2019, declared the 45-year-old missing after going to the market to buy some items for her wedding. About 18 months later, her remains were found on May 27, 2021 in a shallow grave near Otukpo, Obi Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nThe police said it was a case of conspiracy and abduction, stating that investigations revealed that Onche\u2019s last communication took place in Afolabi\u2019s house in Adum, Obi Local Government Area of Benue.\n\nCity Round learnt that the native doctor relocated to his hometown in Oyo State a few days after Onche went missing.\n\nAfolabi said he met Akpan when he went to Onche\u2019s house sometime in 2019 to give her some concoctions to avoid late pregnancy after her marriage to Akpan.\n\nThe native doctor said the deceased first visited him in 2019 to get concoctions that would make her business prosperous.\n\nAfolabi said, \u201cIn 2019, the late Josephine came to my shrine in company with one man. She sold mortar and pestle and needed my help so that the business would flourish. I collected N14,000 for the job and asked her to return in three days.\n\n\u201cWhen she returned, she told me of her plans to get married. She asked me to prepare medicine for her so that she would get pregnant quickly.\n\n\u201cI took the medicine to her house, and it was there that I met her fianc\u00e9. On December 19, 2019, at about 6.30 pm, I saw her and her fianc\u00e9 in Otukpo.\n\n\u201cHe (Akpan) later came to my shrine and said that he wanted to use her (Josephine) for money ritual. He said he would give me N5m for me to be silent. At about 10 pm on a later day, we met inside a forest with Josephine. I never knew Akpan had a gun with him. He brought out a cloth, spread it on the ground, and asked her to kneel down for prayers. Before I could understand what was going on, he shot her on the head. He quickly grabbed a calabash and poured some of the blood gushing out from her head into the calabash. I ran home, got a hoe and we dug a shallow grave and buried her.\n\n\u201cWhen we left the forest, I asked him to bring the N5m that he promised and he promised to give me after eight days. He came to my house later that night and gave me only N50,000. He asked me to be patient to collect the balance.\u201d\n\nHowever, Akpan, a 57-year-old father of five from Akwa Ibom State, denied killing the NSCDC officer, saying he loved her very much.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn December 17, 2019, she visited me in Akwa Ibom State and left on December 19, 2019. On December 23, 2019, her elder brother called me and told me that Josephine was missing. I panicked but her brother told me to calm down. I wanted to visit the family, but they said I should hold on a bit. I was later arrested and I have kept telling them that I am innocent. Before my arrest, I went to the motor park where Josephine boarded a bus in Akwa Ibom State and I saw her name on the manifest. She even used my name as her next of kin.\n\n\u201cI was surprised when the police came and arrested me. The next thing I saw was a man who introduced himself as Afolabi and said I contracted him to use Josephine for a money ritual. On May 27, 2021, the police took me into a forest where Afolabi claimed that we buried my late fianc\u00e9e. In my life, I have not entered such a thick forest, and now someone is insisting that I came this far to bury Josephine who I loved so much.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Akpan said he had met Afolabi once in 2017 and not in 2019. I had visited my fianc\u00e9e and helped her to drop off a bag of charcoal at Afolabi\u2019s house. That was the first and last time that I met him,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The suspension of the 64-day-old nationwide strike embarked upon by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria, JUSUN, has been received with mixed feelings in Abuja.\n\nSome lawyers described the suspension as a welcome development, owing to the strategic importance of the judiciary, others expressed the reservation that since all issues which warranted the strike have not been fully resolved, it would be too early to celebrate.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the strike, the longest industrial action in the Nigerian judiciary was suspended on Wednesday, following a meeting between officials of the union and the National Judicial Council (NJC) led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad.\n\nBoth parties agreed that the strike should be called off in the interest of the nation and to give room for the implementation of agreements JUSUN reached with the Federal Government.\n\nNAN reports that courts are to re-open on June 14.\n\nA Lagos-based Lawyer, Victor Opara, said:\u201dJUSUN through the strike, has sensitised the public on the challenges the judiciary is facing for not being autonomous.\n\n\u201cThey brought awareness to the fact that judicial autonomy and judicial awareness is something that we need, and that will augur well for the administration of justice.\n\n\u201cThey have been able to sensitize lawyers and stakeholders that autonomy and independence, as is constitutionally provided for, is something that should be adhered to.\n\n\u201cFrom what we read, they have been able to get some concessions and some state governors who have hitherto exhibited a lackadaisical attitude to it sat down at the round table to discuss it.\n\n\u201cAt least some agreements were reached, and a window for implementation decided upon\u201d.\n\nOpara,however, advised parties to be faithful to the agreement signed.\n\n\u201cIf an agreement has been signed, it remains for the parties to be faithful to that agreement.\n\n\u201cAny departure from that would suggest that one party is simply reneging on that agreement\u201d.\n\nHowever, Chudi Ojuwku, who spent over two decades teaching at the Nigerian Law School shared a different opinion on the benefits of the JUSUN strike.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that at the end of the day, they have not exactly got the financial autonomy they are demanding.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the judiciary still does not have financial autonomy because the system we run does not allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cAutonomy would mean that the money meant for the judiciary would go to the judiciary and it would be up to it to decide how to use it\u201d.\n\nHe added that as it stands now, the Executive is not interested in that.\n\n\u201cThey want to be the ones to budget and apply the judiciary money for them.\n\n\u201cSo one wonders if (JUSUN) called off the strike to save face or have reached a compromise,\u201d he queried.\n\nAlso, an Abuja-based Lawyer, Mr Bowie Attamah felt that whether or not the strike achieved much depends on how one looks at.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying however that the state of affairs where the judiciary gets its funds at the behest of the state government needed to be looked into.\n\n\u201cThat is what the JUSUN strike has drawn attention to. It is now open to public debate.\n\n\u201cAnd it seems to me that the public is weighing in on the side of JUSUN, if we must practise true separation of powers,\u201d Attamah added.\n\nAlso, Mr Frank Tietie, a Human Rights Activist said the suspension of the strike was a welcomed development.\n\nAccording to Tietie, the strike brought hardship and pain to lawyers, litigants and those in police detentions that required the services of the courts.\n\n\u201cThere are several other ways of ensuring compliance to the constitution standards of judicial autonomy rather than crippling the entire judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe government may function without the judiciary, but businesses and the ordinary man cannot operate normally without the judiciary.\n\nNAN reports that the union JUSUN had begun a nationwide strike on Tuesday, April 6, when the union directed all its members across the federation to shut down all courts after the expiration of the 21-day ultimatum earlier given over the failure of the government to implement the law.\n\nNAN reports that a verdict of the Federal High Court in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, had in January 2014 held that financial autonomy for the judiciary is a constitutional provision that must be complied with by the executive branch of government.\n\nNAN reports that on May 23, President Buhari signed into law the Executive Order to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary across the 36 states of the country.\n\nThe order also mandates the Accountant-General of the Federation to deduct from source amount due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation to each state for states that refuse to grant such autonomy.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said Executive Order No. 10 of 2020 made it mandatory that all states of the federation should include the allocations of both the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets.\n\nAccording to the AGF: \u201cA Presidential Implementation Committee was constituted to fashion out strategies and modalities for the implementation of financial autonomy for the State Legislature and State Judiciary in compliance with section 121(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as Amended).\u201d\n\nNAN reports that the Nigeria Governors Forum said it will start implementing financial autonomy for the judiciary latest by May ending, a pledge that indicated that an end to the ongoing strike that has crippled the nation\u2019s judiciary may be in sight.\n\nThe governors also called on striking members of the JUSUN to call off their two weeks old strike then.\n\nThe Chairman of the NGF, Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, gave this assurance in an interview with journalists after meeting with \u201cstakeholders\u201d from the state judiciary and legislature at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\nFayemi said the modalities for the implementation were worked out at the meeting held at the Presidential Villa.\n\nAccording to him, the meeting, chaired by the Chief of Staff to President Buhari, Ibrahim Gambari, was attended by the Solicitor-General of the Federation, representatives of the judiciary, Conference of Speakers and House of Representatives.\n\nThe first line charge status, which is being respected by the Federal Government in respect of the federal judiciary, entitles the state judiciaries to get funds due to them directly from the Federation Account\n\nNAN\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A section of Nigerians have expressed their anger over President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent comments concerning the South East region.\n\nMany believe that for a second time in less than a month, Buhari had threatened fire and brimstone against the people of the region.\n\nAs bold and succinct these threats are, many wonder why the presidency has neither made clarifications nor done a damage control to at least, calm nerves in the region.\n\nThe President\u2019s comments, as DAILY POST observed, has increased fear, tension and uncertainty in the South East region.\n\nThese threats are being dished out despite reports of alleged killings of Igbo youths already going on in Imo and other parts of the region by the Nigerian security agencies with many wondering what the government\u2019s motives are.\n\nThe President heightened fear in the region on June 5, 2021, when the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu led other top officials of the Commission to brief the President of their progresses and shortcomings ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nSome of the issues in the front burner during the meeting at the State House, Abuja, were those of attacks on government assets, which include INEC facilities in the South East.\n\nAnd responding to the briefing, President Buhari made some vows and also reminded the Igbo of the ugly stories of the 1967-1970 civil war. Buhari had said, \u201cWhoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\n\n\u201cI received a briefing today from the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\n\u201cIn the area of security, we have changed the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General, and we are demanding that they rise fully to the challenges confronting us. There must be zero tolerance for all those bent on destroying our country by promoting crime and insurrection!\n\nBenue: One day, God of Justice will visit you \u2013 Ortom tells killer herdsmen\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President\u2019s speech was shared on different social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook. Many Nigerians felt that the last paragraph of that particular speech was a threat to engage the Igbo on another civil war and so reported the tweet to the management of Twitter, which in response deleted, resulting to the controversial Twitter ban.\n\nHowever, the President returned with a bigger threat on the Igbo nation on Thursday when he appeared on Arise TV as critics and analysts have observed. Buhari said, \u201cIPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they will have no access to anywhere.\n\n\u201cAnd the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and property, I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nAgain, President Buhari angered many Nigerians when he used IPOB to represent the whole of Igbo ethnic group of over 80 million people scattered worldwide.\n\nUsing IPOB to equate all Igbos, Buhari also vowed to send the army and the police to take care of them.\n\nAccording to analyst, Funsho Adodeyin, \u201cPutting all Igbos and their territory together, the Nigerian President brought them so low to describe them as Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, a prominent secessionist organization in the region.\n\n\u201cPut differently, Buhari referred to the entire South East as IPOB. And he didn\u2019t stop there, the President promised to deal with them. Buhari can\u2019t be talking about a secessionist group using a sentence like, \u2018And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and property. I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about,\u2019 it is clear he was talking about an entire race.\n\nAlso embittered by the President comments, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko of a foremost human rights group, HURIWA slammed the President for showing a poor appreciation of the problems of insecurity in the Southeast during his interview by comparing IPOB, to the whole of Igbo ethnic group.\n\nThe HURIWA boss said it is totally unacceptable that a \u201ccountry like Nigeria with millions of intellectuals of global reputation to be governed by a President like Muhammadu Buhari who clearly does not know that Igbo Ethnic bloc is different from the self-determination group known as the Indigenous People of Biafra.\u201d\n\nHe said that Buhari\u2019s ignorance or wilful forgetfulness on the fundamental conceptual chasm and distinction between a group of youthful agitators and the entire IGBO RACE is unpardonable and dangerous.\n\nIn the same vein, a leading socio-political organisation in the South West, Afenifere, also kicked against Buhari\u2019s outburst against Igbos, wondering how a President could display such magnitude of hatred for a particular region.\n\nAs Afenifere\u2019s Secretary General, Chief Sola Ebiseni, clearly pointed out to Buhari, \u201cthe Igbo and their territory is just a dot in a circle of the map of Nigeria, which even if they secede could exit to nowhere since the elders and youths of the South-South had assured him of not being part of the secessionist agenda.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have been reacting to the IPOB but the Igbos whom he said had businesses everywhere.\n\n\u201cHis utterances were very unpresidential and in the mode of common expressions with some unidentifiable northern organisations.\u201d\n\nDAILY POST also spoke with some Nigerians on the streets of Abuja and Lagos who found it difficult to digest Buhari\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe situation of things is gradually getting out of control in the South East and it has been made worse by the fact that the President sees every Igbo as IPOB. It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? But the truth is that with such a belief, no one is safe in the region. They really need to calm things down and adopt a different approach to handle the security issues. You can\u2019t send Army and Police to start chasing and killing everyone on the streets all in the name of fishing out IPOB and ESN,\u201d Funmi Alade, a trader in Apapa, Lagos, told DAILY POST.\n\nAbubakar Yusuf, an Abuja-based right activist, said, \u201cWhat is this all about? Is it about ESN? Then one may ask, are the people in the region complaining about the activities of ESN? The state governors have failed to provide the needed security network to counter the activities of Fulani herdsmen who are invading villages killing, raping and destroying what people have worked for many years and on the other hand, the Federal Government hasn\u2019t done enough to punish these criminals. Ebube Agu Security Network is not real. It\u2019s a scam. And Igbo youths decided to form ESN to help themselves. The next thing Buhari govt wants is to burn down the region. Let them tell us, is there a secret agenda? I mean, it\u2019s frustrating. And the President by his comment on Arise TV the other day now addresses the Igbo in general as IPOB. I\u2019m a northerner, but I must speak the truth, people managing the president have failed, \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe President may not mean it that way, but how do we know? It is for the Presidency to issue a clarification. This they have refused to do; meaning that the President was right about what he said. It was a conscious statement. Take for instance when the President said something the other day many thought he directed it at Tinubu, but his aide came up with a statement to make clarifications. See, the truth is, this presidency is not friendly with the South East. And when they issue threats, they mean it. Buhari said he is sending Army and Police to clean the dot in the Nigerian Map. People should start asking questions before it\u2019s too late. There are banditry and Boko Haram attacks almost on a daily basis in different parts of the North but the situation in the South East seems to be receiving more attention from the government,\u201d Irene Uzodike, a civil servant, opined.\n\nImo prison break: Biafra group hints on reasons for attack on Police facility",
          "summary": "A section of Nigerians have expressed their anger over President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent comments concerning the South East region.\nThe President\u2019s comments, as DAILY POST observed, has increased fear, tension and uncertainty in the South East region.\nAnd responding to the briefing, President Buhari made some vows and also reminded the Igbo of the ugly stories of the 1967-1970 civil war.\n\u201cPut differently, Buhari referred to the entire South East as IPOB.\nSee, the truth is, this presidency is not friendly with the South East.",

          "title": "Igangan massacre: Yoruba elders, groups blast Buhari for keeping mute",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos\n\nThe Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Soludero Hunters Association, and the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) have blasted President Muhammadu Buhari for keeping silent on the Igangan massacre during his visit to Lagos State on Thursday.\n\nGunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen had last Saturday night stormed Igangan, a community in Ibarapa zone of Oyo State and massacred more than 10 persons in cold blood, though there was a resistance from the villagers.\n\nIn separate exclusive interviews with Saturday Sun, they also faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on his stance on the ban placed by Southern Governors\u2019 Forum on open grazing in all the states in the Southern region of Nigeria.\n\nPresident Buhari was in Lagos to commission some projects on Thursday, during which he vowed to restore grazing routes from the Northern to the Southern part of the country.\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, told Saturday Sun: \u201cThe two projects that President Buhari came for in Lagos on Thursday were worth it. They are desirable. But it appears he\u2019s grossly insensitive to the problems of this country. Coming to Lagos, he should have made comments on the Igangan massacre. He should have at least emphathise with the South West.\n\n\u201cThen, he spoke about grazing routes from the North to the South. In this 21st Century, grazing route is archaic. The time Mr. President spoke about, the population of Nigeria was about 50 million. Now, the population of Nigeria is about 211million. So, the population has grown and urbanisation is another reality that we must face.\u201d\n\nThe National President, Soludero Hunters Association, Oba Nureni Ajijolaanabi, also said: \u201cThe Soludero Hunters are taking care of Igangan and its environs. By God\u2019s grace, such massacre would not happen again. The gunmen that stormed Igangan last Saturday night and killed many people are human beings like us. President Buhari should have made comments on the Igangan massacre, especially when he was in Lagos on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAgain, if he could not personally visit Igangan, he should have sent a delegation to visit Igangan on his behalf. But he has not done that. I don\u2019t think that is good enough.\n\n\u201cOn the grazing routes from the North to the South, we would not accept it. But it should be known that we are not fighting Fulani herdsmen. But we are fighting those among them carrying AK-47.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Ilana Omo Oodua, under the leadership of the Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, said the fact that President Buhari did not make any comment on the Igangan massacre has confirmed the allegation that he is president for the North and not the entire country.\n\nThe IOO that spoke through its Communication Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, noted: \u201cWe at Ilana Omo Oodua want to say expressly that the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Federal Republic of Nigeria, a sovereign nation, has been accused of being the president of the North and not Nigeria, by individuals and groups.\n\n\u201cWhen Fulani men threatened war, what did the presidency say? Mr. President even abused our governors in the South West. He said two governors from South West came to meet him over atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and the need for state police. Mr. President said he told them that they were elected to protect their people and they should go and do their jobs, whereas they are mere ceremonial chief security officers. This is an affirmation that President Buhari is president of the North.\n\n\u201cAlso, Mr. President wants to use the gazette on the grazing route to override the governors, especially in Yorubaland. But the fact still remains that the Land Use Act vests the power on land in the governors, and not the president.\n\n\u201cNow, we implore our governors to ensure enactment of a law that would ban open grazing. We know that Ekiti and Oyo State have enacted the laws. The other governors should emulate them. The law must also establish an anti-open grazing marshal. The grazing route should be quashed through laws that would be made by Houses of Assembly and the passed bills should be expressly signed into law by the governors.\u201d\n\nAgbekoya Farmers Society has blasted President Muhammadu Buhari for not reacting to the recent killings and arson unleashed by suspected bandits on Igangan community in Oyo State.\n\nA rights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Kunle Adegoke also knocked the president for keeping mute on he matter.\n\nAdegoke, in a separate interview, said: \u201cIt was expected that the President would commiserate with the victims of violence in different parts of Nigeria, Igangan inclusive. I suspect it is an oversight that the President, while in the South Western part of the country, failed to refer to and commiserate with the victims of the unnecessary violence that is swallowing up the whole of Oke-Ogun.",

He also commiserated with families of fallen servicemen and victims of banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and other forms of violence ravaging the country at the moment and promised to do all within his power to reverse the state of insecurity so as to sustain and deepen the gains of democracy in the country.\n\n\u201cI join you all today to commemorate and celebrate our Democracy Day,\u201d he said, in the nationwide broadcast relayed to Nigerians through national radio and TV stations. \u201cIt is a celebration of freedom and a victory for one people, one country and one Nigeria. As with all democracies we will always be going through improvement processes in our desire to reach the goal of a mature democracy, a strong, evolved and integrated nation state to be reckoned with globally.\u201d\n\nBut to achieve that he noted calls for a collective efforts adding that every Nigerian needs to play their parts. Referring to the spiraling cycle of violence which had seen many people, the servicemen fighting to protect our nation and civilians alike losing their lives and plunging their families into sorrow, he assured them of his sympathy but also doing everything within his power to see that they did not die in vain by addressing the issue of insecurity squarely.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to render my sincere and heart-felt condolences to the families and friends of our gallant service men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty and as a sacrifice to keep Nigeria safe. I extend the same condolence to the families and friends of our country men, women and children who were unfortunate victims of such senseless arsons, kidnappings and murders. I also share the pains of families and direct victims of ransom-seeking, kidnaped victims who went through unimaginable trauma in the course of their forced imprisonment. Let me assure my fellow citizens that every incident, however minor gives me great worry and concern and I immediately order security agencies to swiftly but safely rescue victims and bring perpetrators to justice.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that he does not listen to people\u2019s cries or yearnings, he noted that his administration\u2019s decision to change the Democracy Day from 299h May to June 12, serves as a clear proof that he does.\n\n\u201cWhen this administration decided to change our Democracy Day from 29th May to June 12th in my first tenure, it was not only to honour the sacrifices of the men and women of our country who fought for the return to democracy but also to demonstrate our commitment to satisfy the aspirations of the people and creating an environment for democracy to be an accepted way of life,\u201d he said in a national broadcast.\n\nHe noted that the \u201cindefatigable CAN DO Spirit of the Nigerian has sustained us and would keep pushing us to put these challenges behind us. I thank you for your patience and attention and more importantly your resolve to join hands in making Nigeria the country of our dream.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Region\u2019s leaders reiterate opposition to secession\n\n\u2022Ugwuanyi: Meeting, a positive step towards solving our security challenges\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu\n\nObviously disturbed by the intractable spate of violence in the South-east in recent times, the federal government yesterday sent a delegation, led by the Minister of Defence, Retired Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi, to parley with the governors of the five states in the region in order to chart a way forward.\n\nThe closed-door meeting at the Government House, Enugu, also had in attendance other leaders of political, religious and traditional institutions in the zone, and after deliberating on the security challenges confronting the region in particular and Nigeria in general, they reiterated their commitment to peace, unity and stability of the country.\n\nThe South-east has in the last six months witnessed large-scale arson of public buildings and willful killing of innocent citizens, particularly security operatives, including those of the Nigerian Police whose major facilities were attacked and burnt. Some offices of the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) were burnt along with sensitive materials and inmates were freed from some facilities of the Nigeria Correctional Service in the zone.\n\nThe Defence Minister, Magashi, disclosed that the delegation would relay the commitment reached at the parley and other outcomes of the consultation to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe Defence Minister, who was accompanied by his Interior Ministry counterpart, Rauf Aregbesola and the Chief of Defence Staff, Maj. Gen. Lucky Irabor, explained that they were in Enugu for a consultative meeting with leaders of the South-east zone on the issues of instability and criminality, at the instance of President Buhari.\n\nHe added that the meeting agreed that there were fundamental issues that needed to be addressed in the South-east region.\n\nThe leader of the Presidential delegation stated that one of the issues is the farmers/herders conflict which he said \u201cwill be given the necessary treatment to stop this menace all over the country, from the perspective of national interest.\u201d\n\nMagashi revealed that the second issue they discussed was the problem of marginalisation, stressing: \u201cit is well accepted and further discussion will continue after we have met with Mr. President to see their grievances, and after, the governors will articulate the grievances, so that we can have further discussion on them.\u201d\n\nThe Minister further disclosed that the delegation endorsed the Community Policing Model of the South-east governors, adding: \u201cit should be encouraged because we have set precedence in the Amotekun in the Western part of the country.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe appreciate our discussions. We are most humbled and I think each one of us; the governors, the elders, the religious leaders, were able to say one or two things.\n\n\u201cWe would put our heads together to see that peace and stability of this nation are brought back to normalcy in no distance time.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the media to report the positive side of government and encourage us to pursue legitimate ways in which we can bring peace and stability to this country.\u201d\n\nIn an address at the meeting, the Governor of Ebonyi State and Chairman of South-east Governors Forum, David Umahi, on behalf of the leaders of the zone, restated their commitment to national unity, saying that \u201cthis sincere commitment is a new dawn not only to South East but to entire Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the ban on open grazing, Umahi said: \u201cJust on a very minor specifics for the emphasis of our people, we discussed the issue of ban on open grazing and, of course, this delegation is in support of this ban on open grazing and we also informed the delegation that each of the South-east states has laws in this respect.\u201d\n\nThe South-east Governors Forum Chairman noted that the commitment of the federal government towards addressing all the issues pertaining to herdsmen in the South East was very important.\n\nHe stated that the governors had agreed to articulate all the grievances and concerns of the people of the South East \u201cas spelt out by the Ohanaeze Ndigbo,\u201d saying: \u201cWe are happy that there is genuine willingness for further dialogue on such issues.\u201d\n\nUmahi maintained that Ebubeagu was the only recognised local security outfit in the South-east, emphasizing: \u201cNo other security outfit is speaking for South-east and this is the position of Ndigbo.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are committed to one united Nigeria; we have always mentioned this; all our leaders are committed to this and that is why we read it everywhere, a united Nigeria of fairness, equity and equality of freedom and this we have further expressed.\n\n\u201cThose who dish out hate speeches from our region, threat of violence or secession do not speak for South East. I repeat, we the South-east people are not for secession, we don\u2019t support it; we don\u2019t call for it.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the killings of security men and innocent people in the South-east and the governors are doing everything possible to ensure the safety of our people. We are supporting the security agencies. We finally appeal to our people to continue to engage our youths to eschew violence.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his opening remark, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State described the Town Hall meeting as timely and apt, expressing optimism that the outcome of the meeting would address the security challenges in the South-east zone.\n\nUgwuanyi, who stressed the need for all government structures to uphold the security and welfare of the people as the primary purpose of government as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution, said that the consultation with the federal government delegation and critical stakeholders of the South-east zone, on the current security challenges, \u201cunderscores the centrality of this security responsibility in our consideration.\u201d\n\nThe Enugu State Governor thanked President Buhari for sending the Federal Government delegation to consult with the leaders of the zone.\n\nOther South East leaders at the meeting were the Governors of Abia and Imo states, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu and Hope Uzodinma, respectively; Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Nkem Okeke, the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Uchechukwu Ogah, President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Amb. Prof. George Obiozor, former President of the Senate, Ken Nnamani, Senator Ike Ekweramadu, Deputy Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Toby Okechukwu, Speaker of Enugu State House of Assembly, Edward Ubosi, former Governor of old Enugu State, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyawu, Chief Nnia Nwodo, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Micro-blogging site says it\u2019s ready to meet with Nigerian government for \u2018open discussion\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Bennett Oghifo in Lagos\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan yesterday said he was optimistic that the row between the federal government and Twitter over the suspension imposed on the micro-blogging site would be resolved soon, stating that Nigeria needs Twitter as much as the platform needs the nation.\n\nOn the same day, Twitter announced that it had contacted the federal government for dialogue and resolution of the crisis.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, titled, \u201cBehold the Silver Lining in Nigeria,\u201d to mark the second anniversary of the Ninth Senate, Lawan explained that the federal government was already talking with Twitter to resolve their differences.\n\nThe Senate President, in his reaction, the first since the federal government banned Twitter\u2019s operations a week ago, said: \u201cThe honourable minister of information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, informed Nigerians that they are talking with Twitter to resolve this matter. Our belief is that Nigeria needs Twitter just as much as Twitter needs Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the matter between Twitter and the federal government of Nigeria will be resolved. But beyond that, I\u2019m an optimist; I believe all of us have learnt our lessons.\u201d\n\nLawan also took an overview of the nation\u2019s current security and economic situations and concluded that \u201cthis is the worst shape Nigeria can find itself.\u201d\n\nHe described Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile as \u201cnecessary burden.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe this is the worse level we can get, we can\u2019t get worse than this; it can only get better.\u201d\n\nHe noted that in the last one week, leaders like Olusegun Obasanjo, Abdusalam Abubukar, religious leaders and others had been coming together to proffer solution to the problems bedeviling the nation.\n\n\u201cI believe we are going to have a reversal of this situation. We should not be despair, we should be optimistic. Other countries were like this before and they came out, we will come out,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nExplaining why the National Assembly shouldn\u2019t be described as rubber stamp, Lawan said: \u201cThis is a regular music. There is always a price to pay for everything. By the grace of God, I am 22 years in the National Assembly. As a student of the legislature and parliament generally, I understood there is need for partnership and cordial relationship between us as legislature first.\n\n\u201cWhen I was elected, senators across divide voted for me. They wanted a bi-partisan chamber. We were able to bring ourselves together in both formal and informal way. The next one is our relationship with the House. Apart from confirmation, every legislation requires concurrence. We have been on the same page.\n\n\u201cThe next level is the level of the National Assembly as an institution working with the executive arm of government.\u201d\n\nHe disagreed with the insinuation that the current constitutional amendment programme of the National Assembly was another round of jamboree, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not a jamboree. There were amendments in the past. The Not-too-young to run was part of the amendment.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly passed the state assemblies\u2019 autonomy but what happened? The state assemblies turned it down. We need the local government to function. The bulk of the people are in the local government. The National Assembly is honest. What we are doing is honest, if we make mistake, call us to order. 108 senators and 359 House of Representatives members will vote to achieve consensus.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it was high time Nigerians stop misinterpreting the resolve of the 9th National Assembly to work cordially with the executive arm of government.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis Senate and the National Assembly have shown exceptional patriotism in seeking solutions to the challenges facing our dear country, and in the interventions we have made to some emergencies that confronted us in the last two years.\n\n\u201cWe have been resolute in our approaches, committed in our deliberations, and forward looking in the regulatory frameworks that we proffered, cognisance of our goal as legislators eager to leave a lasting legacy.\u201d\n\nTwitter: We Are Ready to Meet with Nigerian Government for Open Discussion\n\nTwiter in a statement posted yesterday said: \u201cToday marks one week since Twitter was blocked in Nigeria. We have informed the Nigerian government that we are ready to meet for an open discussion to address mutual concerns and see the service restored. We remain advocates for the free and #OpenInternet everywhere. #KeepitOn.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed announced the suspension a week ago after the government alleged that the micro-blogging site was being used to undermine \u201cNigeria\u2019s corporate existence through the spreading of fake news that have \u201cviolent consequences.\u201d\n\nThis was after Twitter took down a controversial tweet of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is the first nationwide inconclusive election and not a democracy day really. So, there is no lesson to learn except that from that time on, we have been experiencing inconclusive elections in the country.\"\n\nWhen asked about President Muhammadu Buhari declaring June 12 as the democracy day, Yakasai said, \u201cHe is the President. He can take whatever decision he wishes to take but I do not see the relevance of June 12 (an inconclusive election) to democracy. I don\u2019t see it.\n\n\u201cI recall a massive extension of resources that were expended on June 12 and the situation of the country and out of which (the resources) we gained nothing, I don\u2019t see anything Nigeria gained out of that election.\n\n\u201cFrom that time on, I can\u2019t remember how many times we have had inconclusive elections, but certainly, that was the first time we had an inconclusive election, but there was nothing good to learn from June 12.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s 1993 election was meant to be a transitional process to civilian rule, although spearheaded by a military dictator, Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nThe unofficial result of the election \u2013 though not declared by the National Electoral Commission \u2013 indicated a victory for the candidate of the Social Democratic Party, MKO Abiola, with 8.3 million votes who defeated the National Republican Convention\u2019s candidate, Bashir Tofa, with 5.9 million votes.\n\nThe annulment of the election plunged the country into an avoidable crisis culminating in the resignation of the dictator and the coming in \u2013 instead of democracy \u2013 of another ruthless dictator, Sani Abacha.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari says Nigerians are forgetful, considering that persons accused of corrupt practices still win elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe stated this on Friday in an interview with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA).\n\nBuhari, who noted that he has been at the forefront of the fight against corruption since his days in the army, added that democracy has provided an excuse for corrupt persons to still find relevance within political settings.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a bit younger, in uniform, when I came, I arrested president, vice-president, governors, ministers, commissioners, and put them under restriction or detention, and told them they are guilty until they can prove themselves innocent. Now, this is opposite \u2013 democratic system, as people would like to believe,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe put investigation panels, virtually based on the present geopolitical zones. For those who held positions and because it was a law for people to declare their assets when they become governors or ministers or commissioners or head of security agencies, they were investigated.

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations\n\nApple Health features for the elderly\n\nPlentywaka partners with GUO\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nThe global fintech industry recorded impressive growth in 2020. This is according to the State of Finance App Marketing 2021 report by US-based mobile marketing analytics company, AppsFlyer. The report reveals that beyond funding, fintech app installations grew by160% in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria alone, loan app installations grew by 43.3%; financial services grew by 34.6%, and investment apps by 20.3%.\n\nSimilarly, Kenya saw 100% growth, and South Africa 52% growth, in fintech app installations.\n\nWhy this growth? The economic effects of COVID-19 led to the rise in fintech app installations.\n\nBesides, in Nigeria, about 56% of the population is unbanked. Also, the unfavourable regulatory conditions could have prompted some of them to make use of loan apps while they explored other financial services.\n\nInterestingly, the fintech space recorded a significant boom in marketing investment. Over 150 Nigerian fintech startups reportedly generate annual revenues of over $5 million.\n\nTo read more on the state of fintech apps, click here.\n\nApple introduces new iPhone features for the elderly\n\nApple, at its World wide developer conference (WWDC) event, announced new features for iOS 15 on the iPhone. The event which started on Monday, June 7 will end today, Friday, June 11.\n\nThoughtfully, among the new features, Apple introduced two health-focused ones \u2014 Walking Steadiness and ability to share health data with family members \u2014 for the elderly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy these features? Older people are prone to falling, and it is the major cause of accidents, injury, and death for older people.\n\nHow does it work? The feature intends to track people as they move through their daily lives.\n\nNot to be confused with fall detection on the Apple Watch, which prompts users to call emergency services, Apple says Walking Steadiness is different, as it focuses on prediction rather than response.\n\nThat is, it is able to predict your risk of falling, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\nWhile this may seem exciting, I doubt its ability to help everyone, as walking patterns differ. Moreover, it is only effective if users carry their phones around at all times; some don\u2019t.\n\nStill, it\u2019s good to know Apple does not just target only the young, but the elderly too.\n\nWalking Steadiness will be available for everyone who has an iPhone 6s and above.\n\nPlentywaka partners GUO to expand inter-state\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nPlentywaka, a Nigerian bus-hailing tech company, has announced its partnership with interstate bus company, GUO Transport, to expand its reach.\n\nThis will lead to the opening of new routes on Plentywaka\u2019s inter-state offshoot, Travelwaka. About 200 routes are expected to be launched. Plentywaka will onboard 600 new buses from GUO, bringing total buses on the platform to 850.\n\nThis partnership is mutually beneficial because GUO doesn\u2019t have to build and maintain proprietary tech for commuters to find them online. Plentywaka, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to buy buses to expand inter-state.\n\nThe end goal of PlentyWaka is to give its users an easy way to compare their choices from a range of travel companies. So perhaps we can expect it to onboard more inter-state bus companies in the near future.\n\nSounds familiar? You might remember Oya.com.ng, the bus ticketing website that was acquired by Wakanow in 2015, barely 2 years into operation. They employed a similar inventory-less model.\n\nSidebar: It might interest you to know that GIGM, another major bus company, has a tech-enabled platform that allows investors to place their buses on its inter-state network.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching this weekend\n\nImproving early child development with words.

It is also the name of the first artificial satellite launched into space.\n\nTell us how Sputnik ATX came about\n\nMy business partner, Oksana Malysheva, and I founded ATX in 2017 after we had managed a fund together.\n\nWe were looking for ways to improve our returns and be more impactful. In our research, we discovered a massive gap with early-stage financing that would give entrepreneurs the tools needed to grow their businesses and then follow-on funding to scale and grow quickly.\n\nWe founded Sputnik ATX so that we could do that. We joke that we teach nerds how to sell, so if they have a minimum viable product (MVP) and a customer and are looking to try and figure out how to grow their startup, we teach them how to grow and build a big company.\n\nWhat does VC investment mean to Sputnik ATX?\n\nDr. Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nWe are early-stage investors, and to us, VC investment is the ability to help very brilliant, gritty, hardworking, humble people get access to capital at an early stage to accelerate their company\u2019s growth.\n\nWe also help them by giving them business skills, particularly in sales and marketing, so that they can refine their product and grow their business in a sustainable way that would help them to produce an amazing company.\n\nEvery VC has an eye or eyes in specific markets. Tell us what market(s) Sputnik ATX is interested in and why?\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily interested in specific markets but in people who have a big impact. So, for example, we talk about this thing called consumer surplus \u2014 an economic term that refers to the difference between what you\u2019re willing to pay for something and what you pay for it.\n\nAnd when we see people who are generating lots of consumer surplus, it means they\u2019re generating lots of value in the market. And we want to help them to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Sputnik comes from the first thing mankind launched into space \u2014 the Sputnik 1 satellite \u2014 and like Sputnik, we\u2019re looking for people who are doing big things.\n\nDoes that mean you invest more in founders than in startups?\n\nIt has to be both. There\u2019s this statement about whether you invest in the jockey or the horse, and we think that you invest in both because good jockeys and good horses work together.\n\nWe think that the best ideas are where you have a fantastic person with incredible technology that the world desperately needs.\n\nBy Sputnik ATX\u2019s standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nJoe Merrill, Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a wrong answer to that question. If you\u2019re a startup founder, you should be asking yourself if what you\u2019re doing is making the world a better place, and if it\u2019s making the world a better place, then the question is how much better.\n\nSome startups that make the world a better place may not generate many financial returns, and that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing bad about that.\n\nBut as venture investors, we have a responsibility to get a return for our investors. So while those are worthy businesses, the economics don\u2019t work for venture capital.\n\nWe have to invest in companies that are making an impact where additional money and resources can go a long way in building the business and generating a return for the investors, the founders, and ultimately something really great for the customers using the service or product.\n\nWhat is your average ticket size?\n\nWe start small by giving them a $100,000 cheque, and we have an option to increase that to $500,000, but we would continue to invest in companies as they grow. We have invested millions in some of the companies in our portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Right now, we\u2019re raising a $100 million follow-on fund, and we have raised over half of the money. We plan to continue to write cheques worth $5 million to $10 million for companies as they continue to grow.\n\nIs there any other African startup in your portfolio other than CribMD?\n\nCribMD is probably the second. The first was Vybe Software, and even though Vybe was based in the United States, like CribMD, most of their customers were in Africa. Vybe has an app called Leia that enables people to launch a website.\n\nIt is free, but for 99 cents a month, you can upgrade and get a much nicer package. It uses artificial intelligence to build completely unique, beautiful websites for anyone.\n\nThat company did really well in Nigeria. Lots of merchants were able to create little marketplaces where they could advertise their businesses online.\n\nHow does Sputnik ATX deal with bad investments?\n\nI hate saying bad investments because bad is kind of like this judgement where something is morally repugnant, and that\u2019s not the case. What happens is someone starts a company, and the company is generating insufficient financial returns to justify the investments, but that doesn\u2019t make them bad.\n\nIt just means that it didn\u2019t work out, and there are a couple of choices. Sometimes those companies can continue to operate because they\u2019re profitable; they\u2019re not just going to get very big.\n\nHowever, if they\u2019re losing money, and if they continue to lose money, you usually sit down with the founders, and you decide if it\u2019s a good time to shut the company down. If there\u2019s some value in the asset that another company would find valuable, you sell the asset to other companies because while you may not be able to do a lot with it, someone else might.\n\nI\u2019ll be frank, it\u2019s okay if a startup doesn\u2019t work; we expect that to happen. It\u2019s how you do it that matters. If you realise your company is not viable, you shut it down in an orderly way. What you do says a lot about the quality and the integrity of the founder.\n\nWhen founders shut things down properly, we love to invest in them because they acted with integrity.\n\nWhat industries are of most interest to Sputnik ATX?\n\nWe invest in anything that is not evil. We have a strict policy of not investing in evil. We have everything, including a company that makes nutritious doughnuts.\n\nEverybody likes doughnuts, but they\u2019re not good for your health. This was a bunch of American football players with such strict diets who worked tirelessly to figure out how to make nutritious yet delicious doughnuts.\n\nWe also have a company producing an engine that will replace the one in cars, and it\u2019s beautiful. This thing would single-handedly stop greenhouse gas emission, and Shell just announced that they are investing in that company.\n\nIt works, and in 20 years, we could all be using this product. So when we see companies with amazing technologies like these, we want to invest in them.\n\nWhat opportunities have Sputnik ATX regrettably passed on, and why?\n\nMy biggest regret is a company called FloatMe. It\u2019s in San Antonio, and we almost accepted them. We limit the number of companies that we can accept to between five and seven for each group. They were the company that just missed the cut.\n\nWe liked the founders, and we should have done it. The company has been very successful. I still love the founders. They\u2019re incredible, and I think the world of the company.\n\nIt\u2019s such an incredible service. It puts a little money into people\u2019s accounts when they are about to overdraft them. I wish we had invested, but it turns out they didn\u2019t need our money, and they\u2019ve done very well.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just happy to see smart people do awesome things that help other people even if we don\u2019t get to invest.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nThey can go to sputnikatx.com. They can also find me on Twitter @Austin_VC. I get and accept DMs from people.\n\nMy business partner is @Oksana_ATX. You can read all about her on our website. I also have a blog where I write about business, economics, and startups because I\u2019m an economist and an entrepreneur.\n\nI talk about Nigeria ever so often on my blog. I love Nigeria.\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday marks the 100th edition of Techpoint Digest, Techpoint Africa\u2018s daily newsletter. As of now, we\u2019ve sent a hundred episodes to over 3,000 subscribers.

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nPossible Twitter negotiations with the Nigerian government\n\nAndroid 12 beta 2 launch and Apple iOS 15\u2019s features\n\nTwitter reaches out to the Nigerian government for negotiations\n\nNigeria\u2019s online space has been abuzz since the government announced the suspension of microblogging and social media platform, Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, according to Channels Television, Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, says Twitter has reached out to the government to negotiate. He made the statement on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, while addressing the State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nThe Minister added that the suspension has been effective, saying Twitter has made significant losses since the ban.\n\nNothing from Twitter: However, the social media platform has kept mum about negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the company, via its Public Policy account on June 5, 2021, said that the platform would \u201cwork to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\nAsk Malami? When Mohammed was questioned about the section of the law that prosecutes Nigerians who continue to use Twitter, he referred journalists to the country\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s comment.\n\nTwitter should pay tax too: The Minister discussed the Federal Government\u2019s move to ensure social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms \u2014 WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, et al. \u2014 are registered in the country and pay tax for the billions they earn.\n\n\u201cQuiz 1: How many topics did we discuss in the first edition? Mention two.\u201d\n\nOn a non-Twitter related note, Apple has announced the new features coming to its new iOS 15.\n\nThe announcement was made during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The event, dedicated to software, is held annually to showcase new features coming to operating systems across Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition kicked off Monday, June 7, and will end Friday, June 11, 2021.\n\nFaceTime, a feature known to be exclusive to iOS devices, will now work outside the ecosystem; it will include options to share screens like video conferencing platform, Zoom. The new operating system will continue Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature that started with the previous upgrade.\n\nAnother interesting feature coming to the new iOS is Live Text. The iPhone camera will now be able to recognise text within an image. So, texts \u2014 phone numbers, words, symbols \u2014 in an image can be copied and saved.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before: While this feature is new to iOS, it bears a close resemblance to Google Lens on Android devices, which can translate and save text from an image using the camera. However, whatever upgrades Apple has introduced to this feature will be ascertained when the operating system launches officially.\n\nThere\u2019s more on Apple\u2019s WWDC here.\n\n\u201cQuiz 2: If you noticed, Emmanuel and Oluwanifemi did something different with previous Thursday editions. What was the first topic in this trend?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Android, Google has released the second beta version of its latest operating system, Android 12. Launched Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the second version will come with more of the features promised at the Google I/O event in May.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Google will bring more beta testers on board with the Android 12 beta 2 release. They will be testing out features like the new privacy dashboard, Quick Setting toggle, and Internet Panels that make switching between Internet providers easy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to install the developer beta of iOS 15.

          "title": "Young Nigerians are losing their voice in a tainted democracy",
          "text": "I told some old friends from King\u2019s College that I wanted to protest the negative impact of the Twitter ban on small businesses at the Lekki Tollgate and needed company. We were going to take a simplistic view of how the restriction was stifling the multitude of businesses that use Twitter as a means of constant communication with old and new customers. It was unacceptable for the government to act this way, not caring about the economic consequences.\n\nI referenced data from Netblocks, an online service that publishes estimates of the economic cost of internet disruptions around the world. Netblocks had put the cost of the ban to Nigeria at N90.7 million ($250,600) per hour. I gave several analogies to buttress how the cost was mainly shouldered by private businesses and not President Muhammadu Buhari who ordered the ban because his ego was bruised by the microblogging platform\u2019s treatment of his tweet. If these private businesses who had all been shut out of Twitter had a say, would the majority sign up for the ban?\n\nMy friends cut me short at this point.\n\nWhile they agreed we would be protesting for a good cause, they urged caution, citing the way the government had violently quashed protests against police brutality last year after armed military men shot at peaceful protesters and killed some of them. Drawing from that experience they urged me to say nothing. They didn\u2019t have to remind me about the events of October 20, 2020. I had also not forgotten the shameful incident for which not a single person has been tried eight months after. I actually had something else up my sleeves. I was carrying out a test of what democracy meant to young Nigerians and there I got my answer.\n\nDemocracy is about freedom. Freedom of speech, expression, association etc, and is also about holding the government accountable. When people are so afraid to speak for the fear of being brutally silenced, what does it say about democracy in such a country?\n\nOf course, we shouldn\u2019t define Nigeria\u2019s democracy by the events of just one year. Our democracy has indeed grown leaps and bounds since the military era, but it is now fast deteriorating.\n\nThere\u2019s been a global hit\n\nGlobally, democracy actually took a hit in 2020.\n\nThe average regional scores in The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index worsened in every single region of the world in 2020 for the first time since 2010.\n\nRead Also: 22 years of democracy: Poverty, insecurity dealing deadly blow on Nigerians\n\nThe average global score in 2020 fell to 5.37 (on a scale of 0-10) from 5.44 in 2019, driven by regressions across all regions, and especially large ones in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nA decade ago the cause of a similar democratic recession was disaffection with governments and a collapse of trust in institutions following the global economic and financial crisis.\n\nBy contrast, the 2020 worldwide democratic regression was largely the result of the measures taken by governments to address the public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which has entailed the suspension of the civil liberties of entire populations for prolonged periods. Across the world in 2020, citizens experienced the biggest rollback of individual freedoms ever undertaken by governments during peacetime (and perhaps even in wartime). The willing surrender of fundamental freedoms by millions of people was perhaps one of the most remarkable occurrences in an extraordinary year.\n\nThe main policy response of governments to the pandemic, whether they were authoritarian or democratic, was to impose social distancing, quarantines and lockdown measures of greater or lesser severity and of longer or shorter duration. By the end of 2020, many Western countries were entering their third lockdowns as cases of the coronavirus surged again as a result of the spread of new, more infectious strains. Only one year before, when the Chinese authorities locked down the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China, the rest of the world looked on incredulously, and people said that it could \u201cnever happen here\u201d.\n\nYet within months, countries around the world were following the Chinese template of lockdowns, albeit without employing the same repressive techniques as China to contain what had by then become a global pandemic. Political and cultural differences\u2014and, in some cases, an initial belief that the pandemic was a hoax\u2014led some democracies to resist the policy of lockdowns.\n\nIn the US in particular, a strong culture of anti-statism and commitment to individual rights resulted in high levels of popular resistance to the public health measures taken by state authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Yet these were differences mainly of degree rather than substance, and social distancing and lockdowns became the standard approach to dealing with the public health emergency across the developed world. In many emerging markets and poorer countries, lockdowns tended to be shorter (but more coercive) and social distancing less restrictive, given the dependence of so many on the informal economy and the state\u2019s inability to provide a social safety net for long, if at all.\n\nAcross the world, the pandemic led governments to take away their citizens\u2019 freedoms and suspend civil liberties. Freedom of movement was taken away as a result of border closures, international travel bans, and restrictions on domestic travel and the use of public transport. Governments invoked emergency powers or imposed states of emergency; dispensed with parliamentary oversight and checks and balances; introduced compulsory social distancing, lockdowns, curfews and mask-wearing; confined people to their homes, except for limited activities; closed educational and cultural establishments; cancelled or postponed elections; prohibited public protests; censured dissenting voices and curtailed freedom of expression, and used the full force of the law to punish those who disobeyed. This list may sound dystopian, yet this was the experience of most people in 2020.\n\nThe unprecedented suspension of individual freedoms, at least in countries where liberty prevailed before the pandemic, accounts for the sharp democratic regression recorded in the 2020 Democracy Index. Government restrictions on citizens\u2019 civil liberties led to scoring downgrades for several Democracy Index questions for almost every country in the world.\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy suffers under Buhari\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy index score declined to 4.10 in 2020 from 4.12 in 2019. In 2015, when the Buhari government was first appointed, the score was 4.62 which means the country saw a 10 percent slump between 2015 and 2020. So Nigeria\u2019s deterioration did not start last year, it\u2019s been on for the entire duration of the Buhari administration.\n\nIt is ironic that Nigeria\u2019s democracy is seemingly rescinding under the watch of Buhari who rode the coattails of a vibrant democracy to mount a sweeping defeat of an incumbent president, the first time it had ever happened in the country\u2019s history of democratic rule.\n\nHis victory was the result of rife discontent among Nigerians about the previous government.\n\nBuhari has however now become a threat to the same vibrant democracy that brought him into power whether it\u2019s in the form of sanctioning the use of aggressive force against peaceful protesters or the recent Twitter ban for all Nigerians. His entire administration is tainted with violation of court orders, arrest of journalists and other anti-democratic actions.\n\nThere was the crackdown on Omoyele Sowore, a journalist and publisher of Sahara Reporters who tried to lead national protests against Buhari\u2019s administration on the grounds of rising insecurity and corruption, even as there is the case of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat who on June 9 clocked 2000 days in illegal detention.\n\nAs far back as December 2016, a Federal High Court in Abuja had ordered El-Zakzaky and his wife released from detention, citing that the continued detention violates their rights and is against Section 35(1) of the constitution which provided \u201cevery person shall be entitled to his personal liberty and no person shall be deprived of such liberty\u2026in accordance with a procedure by law.\u201d\n\nBut the Nigerian government has continued to detain them using the exemption provided in Section 35 (1)(c), that an individual can be detained \u201c\u2026upon reasonable suspicion of his having committed a criminal offence.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if El-Zakzaky\u2019s continued detention is against the other provisions of the constitution.\n\nThis is what Nigeria has become, civic rights are no longer guaranteed. It is why Nigerians are now afraid to hold the government accountable through protests. Unfortunately, the pain of that forced silence is being borne by Nigerians whose misery is worsening.\n\nIn his six years as president, Nigerians have grown poorer each year, with the economy failing to expand at a fast enough pace to provide opportunities for a bulging population. Jobs are scarce and unemployment is the second highest globally at 33 percent in 2020. Nearly 14 million young people are out of work in Nigeria, which has one of the largest youth population, with more than a third of its 200 million people aged 24 or under according to United Nations data. Unattractive government policies and a difficult business environment won\u2019t let private capital come in droves to create jobs while the few investors within the country are being suffocated to death and the few jobs available are lost.\n\nThe lack of jobs for its teeming youth population is fanning insecurity and the worst may be yet to come for a country that is projected by the United Nations to be the third most populous nation in the world by 2050- with 400 million people, double of the current population.\n\nThe deafening silence of Nigerians amid the country\u2019s economic realities should be an indictment of its democracy, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be, at least not yet.",

          "title": "Why Ibori Loot may not be returned to Delta",
          "text": "The controversy over the ownership of the \u00a34.2 million Ibori loot lingers as the federal government insists the recovered money will be used for specific projects and will not be returned to Delta State from where the money was stolen.\n\nThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation, speaking through Umar Gwandu, its spokesperson, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES, said the federal government will use the returned money \u201cfor specific projects as agreed during the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Nigeria and the United Kingdom during the repatriation process.\u201d\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, had said while appearing before a National Assembly committee investigating the status of the recovered loot that the money will be used by the federal government to fund three ongoing projects; namely, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano road and Second Niger Bridge.\n\nA review of the MoU signed by Mr Malami on behalf of the Nigerian government and Catriona Laing, British High Commissioner to Nigeria, on behalf of the UK government, showed that these projects were the projects agreed upon by the governments of the nations involved.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Gwandu told PREMIUM TIMES that \u201cthe federal government never contemplated at any time to act contrary to the agreement signed and no amount of the funds will be sent to any state of the federation.\u201d\n\nIn responding to the question of a seeming uniqueness in this case given that other loots recovered were returned to the states they were stolen from, Mr Gwandu said, \u201cStates that agreed that they have their monies looted by those in authorities, not those who swore affidavits that no kobo was missing from their state government\u2019s fund.\u201d\n\nBy this, Mr Gwandu implies that Delta State Government had sworn an affidavit saying no monies were missing from its coffers.\n\nIn response, Olisa Ifeajika, the Chief Press Secretary to the Delta State Government, said, \u201cWe are not aware of any MoU between the federal government and the United Kingdom that the money will be deployed to anywhere and they have no reason to have entered such MoU to use state government money to do something elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMr Ifeajika said that when monies were recovered from Diepreye Alamieyeseigha of Bayelsa State and Joshua Dariye of Plateau State, they were returned to the states.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be any kind of miscarriage, it will be unfortunate but we know that the federal government in its wisdom will do the needful,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response to Mr Gwandu\u2019s comment on an affidavit, Mr Ifeajika said the case in question is an entirely different case from the one under review.\n\n\u201cIt was one particular fund that came in the course of investigation by federal authorities then\u2026 about $15 million in 2012,\u201d he said, insisting that Delta State never denied this money (Ibori loot) was missing from its purse.\n\nFlashback\n\nIn a bid to verify the claims of both the federal government and Delta State Government, this reporter found that the case alluded to by the attorney general\u2019s office was a bribery case between James Ibori and the Nuhu Ribadu-led Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) where the former offered the latter a $15 million bribe to \u2018get off his back.\u201d\n\nIn order to halt a probe into his finances, Mr Ibori in 2007 tried to bribe former anti-corruption boss Nuhu Ribadu with $15 million in cash \u201cin a bag so heavy one man alone could not lift it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Ribadu\u2019s testimony at a London court in September 2013, in late April 2007, a meeting was arranged for himself and Mr Ibori at a \u201cneutral place,\u201d the house of politician Andy Uba, where the bribe was transferred from Mr Ibori\u2019s boys to Ribadu\u2019s.\n\nHe (Mr Ribadu) said the bribe was taken to the Central Bank for evidence purposes. He would later arrest Mr Ibori. About 15 days after the arrest, Mr Ribadu was sacked.\n\nIn 2012, Mr Ibori pleaded guilty at London\u2019s Southwark Crown Court to 10 counts of fraud and money laundering and was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He returned to Nigeria in 2017.\n\nMr Ibori was governor of oil-producing Delta State from 1999 to 2007.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEFCC Vs Ibori\n\nThe EFCC instituted a 170-count charge of money laundering against Mr Ibori, which was struck out by Justice Marcel Awokulehin. This ruling was appealed by the EFCC and a three-member panel of justices at the Benin Division of the Court of Appeal (Justice Ibrahim Saula supported by Justices P. M Ekpe and H. A Barka) ruled in favour of the anti-graft agency, insisting that Mr Ibori despite being in jail in London, had a case to answer.\n\nDuring the hearing of the case, the Delta State Government asked that the $15 million bribe be returned to the state. EFCC applied for a forfeiture of the money to the federal government following an action instituted against the commission and the Attorney General of the Federation by the Delta government, stating that Mr Ibori should not be investigated and that the state had lost no money from its treasury.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, it is too late for the Delta State Attorney General to lay claim to this money because of his action where he instituted a case against the Commission saying the governor should not be investigated,\u201d Rotimi Jacobs, counsel to the EFCC, had stated.\n\nMr Jacobs went on to reveal that in paragraph 10 of the affidavit deposed in the said case by the Delta State Attorney General, it was stated that the state accountant general, after a thorough investigation, had concluded that no money was lost and that they have no complaint of any missing money.\n\nActivist, Lawyer React\n\nSpeaking with PREMIUM TIMES, David Ugolor, the executive director of Africa Network for Environment and Economic Justice (ANEEJ), said, \u201cI think it is a lack of proper democratic values in the country and the UK not obeying the Global forum asset recovery principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal government has stuck with their position even with the controversy from weeks ago when the accountant general made a comment during the public hearing on assets that the money has been transferred to Delta State and later on reversed its position.\u201d\n\nMr Ugolor added that it shows the inconsistency within the federal government and how unfortunate it is for the government to not follow its own rules and regulations (Recovery and Management of Stolen Assets and Proceeds of Crime Guidelines, 2019) on assets redistribution to state governments.\n\nAccording to the activist, also worrying is that Nigerians are not aware of some of these regulations and the complicity of the British government for not acting in favour of victims of corruption, which is a blow to the asset recovery principle that emphasises restitution to benefit those who are victims.\n\n\u201cIbori stole Delta State and not federal government money, so I do not understand why the money should be used by the federal government,\u201d he said, adding that this was not the case for Bayelsa and Plateau states who have had similar loot issues.\n\nMr Ugolor shared a similar view as the Delta government that the recovered loot is distinct from the EFCC case which is what the attorney general\u2019s office was referring to.\n\nIn her reaction, Chisom Ihekwaba, a lawyer, said the regulation on assets recovery should take precedence over the MoU between Nigeria and the UK; and thus the money should be returned to the Delta State Government.\n\n\u201cTthe issue of precedence arises if there\u2019s a conflict between the provisions of an MoU and an existing law/rules/regulations. In such a situation, the Regulation on Asset Recovery and Management should take precedence, being a national instrument.\n\n\u201cHowever, parties are bound by their agreement and in some instances, if the \u2018waiver and severability\u2019 clause in the MoU subjects it to ONLY UK laws/rules, then if conflicts arise, it will be resolved in favour of the MoU. In such a case, the MoU takes precedence because Nigeria\u2019s national laws/regulations have been excluded,\u201d Ms Ihekwaba, the programme manager, Legal Defence and Assistance Project, said.\n\n\u201cThe best legal way to solve this is to apply the existing Regulation on Asset Recovery and Management. It\u2019s also an option that many Nigerians are in favour of,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor/Port Harcourt\n\nAs part of strategy to preempt criminal attacks on Rivers State, Governor Nyesom Wike has ordered the destruction of all criminal hideouts in Ahoada, Elele, Eleme and Onne to prevent attempt to undermine security of the State.\n\nThe governor said criminals are already coming to terms with the reality that Rivers State is too hot for them to invade at will and detonate their foolish attack on targeted security posts and personnel.\n\nGovernor Wike, who made this assertion in a state broadcast on Friday, disclosed that the State government has identified the hideouts, safe houses and secret places that provide both cover and comfort for the hoodlums to plan, execute and return to after operations.\n\n\u201cThis was the reason we ordered the destruction of all the shanties and makeshift structures located along Elele to Ahoada expanse of the East\u2013West road to deny the criminals the opportunity to continue to undermine our security from these hideouts.\n\n\u201cWe have equally decided to destroy all the shanties, illegal shops and mechanic sheds along the Eleme to Onne stretch of the East-West road having discovered these places also as hideouts and operational bases for criminals and criminal activities in the State.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I hereby direct owners of such shanties and illegal structures along the Eleme \u2013 Onne axis of the East-West road to vacate the area within two weeks from today 11th June 2021 as the State Government will go ahead to destroy these structures without any further notice.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike said Government is not unmindful of the economic effect these measures will have or may have had on residents carrying out businesses in the affected areas. He, however stressed that government is merely discharging its constitutional responsibility to advance the collective security of all with no ethnic targets in mind or attachment to political sentiments.\n\nHe explained that the existing curfew in Rivers state will not last one day beyond necessary and plead with all residents to endure the temporary inconveniences in the interest of the State and collective wellbeing of all.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to take the war on criminality and insecurity to the den of the criminals and we will neither yield nor lower the tempo of our assault until they are comprehensively neutralized.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has officially flagged off commercial operations of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway project yesterday.\n\nThe President while speaking at the flag off ceremony at the Mobolaji Johnson Railway Station, Ebute Metta, Lagos, said the project signals yet another milestone in the drive of the Buhari Administration to revitalize the railway system, establish it as a choice mode of transportation for both passengers and freight and position it as a transportation backbone that can transform industrial and economic activity in the country.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the project is a vital line that establishes an end-to-end logistic supply chain in railway transport within its short corridor, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan, as goods to the hinterland would now be transported by rail directly from the Apapa port Quayside straight to the Inland Container Depot located in Ibadan from where it can be distributed to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201d In clear recognition of the challenges posed to our economic growth by absence of strong and effective infrastructure, we have in the rail sector, further to other ongoing railway infrastructure projects, embarked on the completion of the outstanding segment of the Lagos \u2013 Kano railway, which is Ibadan \u2013 Kano.\n\n\u201d The Lagos \u2013 Kano railway project when completed will link the Kano \u2013 Maradi line at Kano and a rail link from the Nigeria southern ports of Lagos to Maradi in Niger Republic will be achieved.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that the connection through rail would position Nigerian ports as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic and it would be beneficial to the economy through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation.\n\nHe revealed that the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Finance have been directed to vigorously act on engagement and reaching financial agreements with appropriate co-financiers to partner with the Federal Government for the development of the Ibadan \u2013 Kano railway and the connection to the Tin Can Island port as well as the West \u2013 East Coastal rail line from Lagos to Calabar linking Onitsha, Benin, Warri, Yenagoa, Port Harcourt, Aba and Uyo.\n\n\u201d This is already yielding the desired result as construction activities on the railway segment, Kaduna \u2013 Kano has commenced with back-end engineering activities.\n\nDistinguished guests, from the beginning of this administration, railway infrastructure development has been given the priority it deserves and various milestones have been reached, right from when the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway was flagged-off for commercial operation in 2016 to this Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project being commissioned today for full commercial operation.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, for his drive and tenacity towards achieving the milestone recorded today, as well as the wonderful team in the Ministry that assisted in achieving this feat.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi earlier in his remarks expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for summoning the courage to take the loan from China Exim bank to execute the rail project.\n\nHe also thanked the Chinese government for the loan with the hope that the Asian country will also approve the loan for the Ibadan to Kano axis which he said the Buhari led administration intends to start and complete before the end of its tenure.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Chinese government through the China Exim bank was able to give us the loan at a concessionary rate to construct from the seaport down to Ibadan.\n\n\u201c We hope that we get money to be able to construct from Ibadan -Kano so that we can complete the track and make sure that business takes place,\u201d he said\n\nThe Board Chairman, Nigerian Railway Commission NRC in his welcome address reiterated that the importance of the project cannot be over emphasized as it would be of great impact to the Nation\u2019s citizens and her economy.\n\nThanking President Buhari for his support in ensuring the project is a success, he stressed that the occasion is the third time of the President commissioning railway project completed during his tenure.\n\nHe equally thanked the Minister for being the chief pilot of the project in which the project wouldnt have been successful without his tenacity.\n\nDignitries at the event include Professor Wole Soyinka, Minsters of Info and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed , Works and Housing SAN Babatunde Fashola, Youth and Sports, Dr Sunday Dare, Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Minister of State for Transport, Sen Gbemisola Saraki, Perm Sec Dr. Magdalene Ajani.

          "text": "The suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian government has forced the federal government and some agencies of government to move to Koo, an Indian microblogging platform, to keep in touch with the public.\n\nBarely a week after banning the tech giant over the deletion of a tweet on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s account, the federal government has joined the Indian microblogging site.\n\nIt has already opened an official account on the platform with the handle @nigeriagov and had above 10,000 followers as at Thursday night.\n\nAlso, some aides of the government have opened accounts on the app.\n\nAccording to reports, Koo was built after the Indian government\u2019s constant disagreements with Twitter.\n\nKoo co-Founder Aprameya Radhakrishna, who confirmed that the platform is now available in Nigeria, said they are working on adding Nigeria\u2019s local languages.\n\nHe said: \u201cA very warm welcome to the official handle of the Government of Nigeria on @kooindia! Spreading wings beyond India now\u201d.\n\n\u201cKoo is now available in Nigeria. We are thinking of enabling the local language there as well. We are considering introducing a local Nigerian language into the Koo app.\n\n\u201cNigeria is similar to India in terms of language diversity. It has hundreds of regional languages. Koo has a global outlook and will enable micro-blogging in countries that need it the most.\n\n\u201cWe have built a scalable platform, and while we are still enhancing the product, it\u2019s already available for use in multiple countries today.\u201d\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
