          "title": "Vagina can be surgically-constructed for females born without one \u2013Physician",
          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nAn expert says that a female individual who is born without a vagina can have one surgically constructed for her.\n\nThe physician spoke against the backdrop of a tweet by a legal practitioner, Malachy Odo, via his Twitter handle @MalachyOdo.\n\nHe had narrated how a husband was seeking divorce from his wife of two years because she didn\u2019t have a vagina.\n\nHis tweet reads, \u201cIn court yesterday, a guy claimed that his reason for seeking to divorce his wife of two years was because she does not have a vagina\u2026\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr. Faye Iketubosin, described the condition as vaginal agenesis; adding, \u201cIt is a rare disorder that occurs when the vagina doesn\u2019t develop, and the womb (uterus) may only develop partially or not at all.\u201d\n\nIketubosin, who is also the Medical Director of George Memorial Medical Centre, noted that this condition is present before birth, and may also be associated with kidney, heart or skeletal abnormalities.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that predisposes to it; it is the way the vaginal fails to develop at the embryonic stage\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to US-based Centre for Congenital Anomalies of the Reproductive Tract, vaginal agenesis affects one out of 5,000 to 7,000 female infants.\n\nSometimes, vaginal agenesis is recognised at birth. Most times, the condition isn\u2019t diagnosed until puberty, when the teen notices she hasn\u2019t started her period and seeks medical advice, the centre said.\n\nContinuing, it says, \u201c90 percent of patients are born with the condition, also known as Mayer-von Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser\u2019s Syndrome (MRKH);\u201d and they have a collection of symptoms which may include an absent uterus and cervix, kidney, hearing loss, and a possible spinal abnormality such as curvature of the spine.\n\n\u201cAll [affected] females will either have an absent vagina or an incomplete vaginal canal,\u201d it said.\n\nExperts say young women with vaginal agenesis have normal ovaries and normal external genitalia and thus go through puberty and develop breasts, under arm and pubic hair, \u201cexcept they will not have their periods.\u201d\n\nPhysicians say that 30 percent of patients with vaginal agenesis have kidney abnormalities. \u201cUsually, one kidney is absent or one or both kidneys are dislocated. The kidneys could also be fused together in a horseshoe shape,\u201d the centre said.\n\n\u201cApproximately 12 percent of girls with vaginal agenesis have skeletal abnormalities. Two thirds of those patients experience minor problems with the spine, ribs or limbs,\u201d physicians warn.\n\nAccording to Iketubosin, who is also a fertility expert, this condition may interfere with a woman\u2019s ability to conceive.\n\n\u201cThe condition may also be corrected, depending on the type of vaginal agenesis. It is a developmental problem and a developmental problem can be partial or complete.\n\n\u201cPartial means that the womb develops but the vagina doesn\u2019t. Complete means that there is no womb, no vagina. If there is no womb and no vagina, there is no menstruation.\n\n\u201cMenstruation for such women is dependent on if the stage of development of vaginal agenesis in such people is confined to the vagina and not to the rest of the genital tracts.\n\n\u201cBecause the uterus, the ovaries, the Fallopian tube and the vagina all come from what is called the Mullerian duct.\n\n\u201cSo, if it is a complete lack of development, we won\u2019t have a uterus either but if it is partial, the uterus is developed and it is only the vagina that is not developed.\n\n\u201cThen it is possible to surgically create a vagina that leads to the uterus. Then conception will be possible.\u201d\n\nHe added that because the outer sex organs appear normal, the anomaly is often not found until around age 15 or until girls reach their teens but do not menstruate.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "One of the commanders of the Eastern Security Network, ESN, Emeoyiri Uzorma Benjamin, alias Onye Army, who was arrested by operatives of the Force Intelligence Response Team, has made some shocking confessions.\n\nOnye Army also said he is happy that Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has been arrested while begging the Buhari government for amnesty.\n\nHe confessed his alleged involvement in the attacks of government assets and killing of security operatives, including those from the Igbo speaking areas.\n\nThe arrested commander said that the heads of 10 girls caught in Imo State were used in preparing charms to fortify members of the group against police bullets.\n\n\u201c\u2026We were not talking to Nnamdi Kanu directly, but we were receiving his instructions from our camp leaders,\u201d Vanguard quoted him as saying.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu said we should dismantle all checkpoints and even kill the security agents manning the checkpoints because they were killing Igbo people. I believed him and obeyed the order because I had taken an oath to obey Nnamdi Kanu, the supreme leader of IPOB.\n\n\u201cDuring our first attack, Ikonso brought two AK47 rifles while two of our members brought two locally made guns which we used to attack a police checkpoint in Orlu where we killed a police officer.\n\n\u201cTwo of our members were also killed but the police officers ran away, abandoning their vehicle, which we burnt and took away one of the police rifles. After the operation, we attacked several other police stations and checkpoints.\n\n\u201cThen Ikonso, Engineer Mike and Temple organized the attack at the Owerri Prisons and Imo State Police Command, where several inmates were freed and more than 50 police rifles were carted away on the instruction of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu because he said nobody deserved to be in prison.\u201d\n\nOnye Army further narrated how his group carried out several other attacks on security personnel in Imo and Anambra states before the death of Ikonso.\n\n\u201cI was in his residence on the night he was attacked by security agents. I fought with my AK-47 rifle, but I abandoned it and escaped through the back gate when I expended all the bullets in the rifle,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, they proceeded to burn the house of Hope Uzodimma, the Governor of Imo State and killed one of his security personnel in retaliation for the death of Ikonso who was gunned down by security agents.\n\n\u201cThe white and red clothes we tied on our bodies in the video were charms which we call local bulletproof and we prepared charms with the heads of 10 young girls,\u201d he added.\n\nNnamdi Kanu, who had constantly delivered live broadcasts on social media from the United Kingdom, was arrested last weekend in Kenya and bundled to Nigeria by security operatives.\n\nHowever, the IPOB leader had consistently denied that members of his group, the ESN, were responsible for attacks and killings of security personnel In the South East and South South.\n\nHe had insisted that the ESN was created to defend the South East and South South from killer Fulani herdsmen who attack communities, kill their hosts and destroy farm lands .\n\nMoreover, the IPOB leader, who was arraigned before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja on Tuesday and remanded at the Department of State Services, DSS, narrated to his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, how the Kenyan authorities detained, tortured him before handing him over to the Nigerian government.\n\nThis was after the East African country had denied any involvement in Kanu\u2019s rearrest and extraction.",

          "title": "Cattle grazing routes: The real story",
          "text": "By Chidi Obineche\n\n\u201cWhat I did was ask him (Abubakar Malami, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice) to go dig (out) the gazette of the First Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south, or east to west, they had to go through there. If you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The Khadi or the Judge will say, pay this amount and if you can\u2019t, the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given, and people were behaving themselves. In the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places; there were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known. So I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nWith these words on Arise Television \u201cMorning Show\u201d interview on June 10, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari lit up a fire that has smouldered and raged for weeks on end. It was not the first time that the grey issue of cattle grazing routes would seize the momentum in the country, or generate a national furore. Violent conflicts between nomadic herders from the north of Nigeria often referred to as Fulani herdsmen and sedentary agrarian communities in the central and southern parts of the country have assumed frightening dimensions in the recent past, threatening national peace, unity, and stability.\n\nIn 2016 alone, the clashes recorded an estimated death toll of 2,500.The fatalities are increasing with each passing year. Conflict resolution mechanisms to reform livestock management practices, confront environmental issues and address cross-border movements of armed herders and cattle rustlers, identified as some of the triggers of the crises have been less than satisfactory and have not paid off. Issues of land and water use, obstruction of traditional routes, livestock theft and crop damages have not been visited with firm and prompt response. Their roots run deeper. The road to this impasse has been tough and grueling.\n\nAccording to the Grazing Reserves Law of 1965, Nigeria has 415 grazing reserves but only about one third of it is functional. Others have been encroached on through infrastructural developments, (houses, roads etc) or being used for crop farming. About 141 of the grazing routes are officially logged or gazetted. But less than 20 of them are currently suitable for use by pastoralists. For some people, the presidential order is long awaited, needful, and a product of circumstances; others see it as unlawful and an attempt to stir up temper.\n\nHow the mess started\n\nThe advent of colonial rule in Nigeria modified the pattern of life of the pastoral Fulani. The relative peace and security that came with the British rule encouraged them to move out of their fortified and overcrowded villages to the grazing areas. Consequently, nomadic lifestyle, which is traditional to the Fulani ethnic group, began to grow in proportions. The cattle population of the northern emirates according to reports during the colonial era was between \u201cthree and four and a half million.\u201d The estimation was based on the distribution of cattle for the revenue reports. The figures of the report were obtained from cattle tax returns (Jangali) which were based on native administration officials\u2019 returns.\n\nGovernor W Edgerton of Lagos, in his confidential report of 1905 for the abolition of the caravan tolls, confirmed the dependency of the southern provinces on the importation of cattle from the northern emirates. He said: \u201cthere was a scarcity of meat for local requirements, especially in the Lagos area, because of the reduction in supply from Fulani/Hausa traders as a result of toll regulations.\u201d In the annual report of Sokoto province for the year 1909, Resident Burdon recorded his observations that cattle was the staple export and expressed his desire to see to the development of the trade \u201cas the great economic future of the province.\u201d\n\nThere was a widespread belief that still subsists, that nomadic cattle ownership was part of the ageless and unalterable pattern of African life. No effort was made to coerce or induce the Fulani herders to settle and be integrated into a farm economy. From the first decade of the 20th century, the demand for cattle increased, particularly from the southwest, from Ilorin southwards to Lagos. The growth of human population and settlements, expansion of public infrastructure and acquisition of land by big farmers and other commercial interests have shunted herders out of the post independence government of the former northern region (now split into 19 states).The existing fragile relationship among the ethnic and religious groups in the country has been escalated by the conflicts. The predominantly Christian communities of the south loathe the influx of basically Muslim herders usually referred to as \u201cIslamisation force\u201d. And since these herders are mostly Fulani, their motives have been given a skewed interpretation as they are viewed with suspicion and as harboring an ethnic and religious agenda.\n\nWhy Fulani herdsmen carry arms\n\nAn official at the Federal Ministry of Justice gave an insight into why the herdsmen move about with arms. His words: \u201cThe social standing of the Fulani herdsmen depends on the number of cows he has. This thing is tied to their culture and religion. They don\u2019t believe in buying land or being involved in other ostentatious acquisitions. They believe in what nature offers them. They carry arms because the forest is a jungle. They kill each other and steal each other\u2019s cows. That is cattle rustling. What they do is to sell one or two cows and use the money to purchase AK-47 guns probably between N450, 000 or N500, 000 to protect themselves. Thereafter, they redeploy the arms to other uses which is what is causing the herders /farmers mayhem.\u201d\n\nSaturday Sun further learnt that the herdsmen usually pay for grazing rights to some village heads to be allowed to graze in the village farms. But the village heads would pocket the money and fail to inform their subjects that they had been paid. The herdsmen therefore get angry and boil over when these farmers accost them in the farms and demand that they leave. After settling the village heads to have access to the farms, the angry herdsmen expectedly resort to violence over what they perceive as breach of contract.\n\nPrevious attempts at reopening the cattle grazing routes\n\nIn 2009, the federal government embarked on a programme that gulped a whopping $247 million to mark out grazing reserves across Katsina, and Bauchi as well as Abuja. Establishing these reserves which were deployed to attend to the needs of more than 15 million pastoralists entailed demarcating 175,000 hectares of grazing land, building veterinary units and constructing settlements for nomads to use on their way through. Government also launched the demarcation of a 1,400km livestock route from Sokoto State in the Northwest to Oyo state in the Southwest, and another 2000km route from Adamawa in the Northeast to Calabar in the South-south.\n\nIn addition to these grazing routes, the Federal Government in its tepid eagerness to address the problem holistically budgeted $10b for what it called Great Green Wall Program (GGWP) geared towards combating desertification, which is one of the major factors pushing pastoralists from the far north to the south in search of greener and richer grazing. The violent clashes between herdsmen and farmers indisputably revolve around encroachment on their grazing lands and migration routes and the setting aside of designated grazing areas for herders.\n\nStakeholders weigh in\n\nThese two issues usually spark off violence leading to killings, rapes, arsons, abductions, destruction of property, etc. The apex socio-cultural group of the Igbo, Ohanaeze in a swift reaction to Buhari\u2019s directive, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t ask people in an agrarian area like Benue and Enugu to cut out areas and designate them as grazing precincts just to avoid incessant conflicts with herders.\u201d The group which spoke through its President-General Prof. George Obiozor, said: \u201cThe proposal is simply provocative. Grazing fields mean less farmland and farm yields for a people who are mostly farmers and hamper food security and deplete the agricultural profile of these agrarian states.\u201d However, despite the ever increasing escalation of conflicts between the herders and farmers on a steady basis, no middle ground has been reached and an end to the search for grazing sites across the country still remain a remote prospect.\n\nThe Executive Director, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) Adetokunbo Mumuni argues that the gazetted law on cattle routes and reserves are part of northern Nigeria laws and is not applicable outside the north unless it is nationalized. Dr Ajibola Basiru, the senate spokesman and senator representing APC, Osun Central, insists there is no law on grazing routes in the country. He adds that grazing reserves recognized as a state law in the 1999 constitution criminalized open grazing. He said: \u201cGrazing Reserve laws in some states created from the former northern region of Nigeria are deemed to be state laws by section 318 of the 1999 constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cThey have been adopted from the Grazing Reserve Law of Northern Region of Nigeria (NN law of 1965) including Cap 3 laws of Kwara State, Cap 56 laws of Bauchi State, and Cap 55 laws of Katsina State. Such law cannot be within the competence of the National Assembly.\u201d In specifics, he explained that Section 37 of Grazing Law Cap 63 of Kwara State and Section 40 of the law prohibits possessing, carrying or using for any purpose, any firearms or other weapons for other purposes in the grazing areas.\n\nDan Nwanyanwu, National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party, (ZLP) says cattle routes will not reflect the demands of a 21st century development in cities and states. \u201cWhether they respect vital infrastructure along the so-called routes or not, the important issue is that Nigeria should not continue to live in the past. The government should not give the impression that it is partisan by taking us back to the stone age.\u201d\n\nHow the herders-farmers crises began\n\nThe Fulani ethnic group rears the majority of Nigeria\u2019s cattle, traditionally estimated at 83% pastoral, village cattle 18%, and Peri-urban 0.3%. They are spread across nine nations in the West African sub-region. They are core and traditional pastoralists. For pastoralists, cattle represent the major household asset and play a key role in status and prestige, and for cementing social relationships such as kinship and marriage. Before the 1950s, a symbiotic relationship existed between pastoralists, crop farmers and their environment with the Fulani practicing transhumance. In the dry season, they migrated to the southern part where there are ample pasture and green vegetation.\n\nIn the wet season, these areas faced the challenge of diseases transmitted by Tse-tse flies, so they would migrate back to the northern savannah zone, supplying dairy products to the local farming communities. In return, they received grains, and after the harvest, cattle were allowed to graze on crop residues in fields, and would leave behind droppings that become manure. Fulani do not have rights to land, a situation that breeds local conflicts when their herds damage crops.\n\nGrazing reserves came to the rescue of the Fulani in 1965 to provide them with secure land tenure, and to modernize the livestock sector, and dissuade them from nomadic lifestyle. As a follow up, between 1970 and 1980, the federal and state governments collectively invested $70m USD in livestock development. About 70 % of the amount was allocated to grazing reserves. While the selection and acquisition of grazing lands was placed on individual states, the reserves came through the National Livestock Project Unit (NLPU) of the Federal Livestock Department, now known as National Livestock Project Department. They are saddled with infrastructure development like provision of boreholes, dams, schools and roads.\n\nHowever, they failed to tap into the venture because of the absence of formal and comprehensive gazetting, non-legalized grazing, land ownership, slow provision of infrastructure. Many states were indifferent to establishing reserves because of the prohibitive amounts of land compensation occasioned by the Land Use Act, 1978. Today, according to official revelations, there are 415 grazing reserves in 21 states, and 141 are gazetted, while only 2 are in the south \u2013 Oyo and Ogun. But other unofficial sources insist that, of the 415 grazing reserves, only 1/3 is in use currently, while 24 of them are gazetted. As the livestock population increases, the graze-able land is decreasing. This led to increased tension between crop farmers and Fulani pastoralists. It is such that in the last decade, it has claimed no fewer than 2,000 lives, 16,000 houses, multiple rapes of females, kidnapping for ransom and other heinous crimes.\n\nRoadblocks and running battles\n\nThe problems of cattle grazing took a turn for the worse at the beginning of the current democratic dispensation in 1999 and gravely threatened the corporate existence of the country. By 2015, the herdsmen crises heightened with colossal damages. The federal government in 2018 conceived the idea of building cattle colonies for the herders, but it was resisted by many Nigerians and state governments mainly in the South, who perceived it as a grand ploy to grab land by the Fulani.\n\nShortly afterward, the government came up with Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) Initiative. It also fell flat on its face as it also was swiftly and stiffly resisted. Then, came the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP). Under this programme, the Federal Government, Adamawa, Benue, Ebonyi, Edo, Kaduna, Nassarawa, Oyo, Plateau, Taraba and Zamfara states conceded to set up cattle ranches. Estimated to cost N179b over 10 years period, the two tiers of government were to throw in jointly N70b in the first three years of the pilot phase of the programme. Again, many Nigerians who believed it to be a clone of RUGA fought against it. Regardless, government forged ahead with the plan and launched the pilot phase in Adamawa, Nassarawa, and Plateau states in February 2020. But the rampaging COVID 19 pandemic then and the poor state of revenues of the federal and state governments jeopardized it.\n\nApart from political coloration of the efforts to sanitize pastoralism, other impediments have also combined to obstruct its progression. Chief among them is the Land Use Act, 1978. Section 1 of the act says:\u201d Subject to the provisions of the ACT, all land comprised in the territory of each state in the federation are hereby vested in the governor of that state.\u201d There is also the existence of a 1969 ruling by Justice Adewale Johnson which declared that \u201cthere is no grazing route established by law and protected by law\u201d. That judgment has not been set aside till today. The grazing routes gazetted and recognized by law existed only in states created from the old pre 1966 northern Nigeria. Even at that, the laws recognizing grazing routes are state laws and therefore inferior to the Land Use Act which is a federal law that enjoys protection in the constitution. Besides, open grazing of cattle is banned in the south of Nigeria and backed by state laws. The 141 gazetted routes cover only 2.7 million hectares of land, while the grazing reserves cover 4,275,326 hectares. The land mass covered is infinitesimal to make any progress or impact.\n\nCattle routes reopening in top gear\n\nFollowing President Buhari\u2019s directive to reopen the grazing routes, a rash of activities has seized the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of Justice. Saturday Sun checks at the two ministries last week gave positive indication of an imminent reopening of the grazing routes and reserves as directed. Indeed, the reopening has flagged off in full force. The Acting Director of the Department of Animal Husbandry in the ministry, Mrs Winnie Lai-Solarin declined to comment on the unfolding development when contacted. So did two other senior officials of the ministry.\n\nHowever, information gathered indicates that stock routes are currently being retraced and recovered. Important landmarks along the known routes are being identified whether or not they have been built on or not. The focus for now is on the non-conflict areas. Those encroached on by vital public infrastructure are not to be effected in the recovery exercise. Some herdsmen have been drafted into the project to assist in the identification part of it. The exercise is being safely carried out, and based on the findings of Saturday Sun, the exercise, within the context of the controversial grazing reserve law, is slated to last for about 30 days.\n\nTo throw more light on the issue, a senior official at the ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak informed that, \u201cwe flagged off serious work on the project immediately after the President\u2019s pronouncement. It is not that nothing had been done before; the directive only infused some urgency into what we have been doing before now. A ministerial order gave vent to meetings which have been held regularly since then, with the minister co- coordinating. Before long, you will see the results. Teams have also been set up to work on the recovery plan of the stock routes and reserves. The government is desirous of putting this problem behind. Lobbying by various interests has intensified. We have legal support and advice from the Ministry of Justice to guide us. The lawyers are examining the laws not only for implementation, but also to scrutinize the legal effects and other matters connected to the directive. The Committees on Agriculture at the National Assembly are involved. They are currently in a meeting with all the state directors and the directors here as you can see (Monday, June 21, 2021). The National Assembly is being carried along so that there won\u2019t be any misunderstanding, delays or roadblock.\u201d\n\nHe added that the number of consenting states to the project is growing saying that as at the previous day 22 states and the Federal Capital Territory had keyed in for the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP). Asked why the whole affair is shrouded in utmost secrecy, he responded that as civil servants it is a tradition. \u201cHere, only the Director of Publicity is authorized to speak, though directors can also speak.\u2019 He continues: \u201cwhen the grazing reserve law came into being in the 60\u2019s, the population of Nigeria was about 56 million people. The livestock population was around 3 million. The livestock population started increasing as human population grew too. The pressure to have corridors connecting cattle from one reserve to another increased too. Some of the reserves and stock routes were gazetted, while some were not. I don\u2019t understand it when people say the law was from the Northern Region. Was Oyo or Ogun State in the North? Can a northern regional government law be applicable in Oyo and Ogun? The truth is that infrastructural development, farmlands, estates have encroached on the stock routes and reserves. But don\u2019t forget that these Fulani herdsmen usually move with their little ones, especially sons, who eventually take over from them. Those children that migrated with their fathers about twenty or thirty years ago are now mature, and may have discovered and can recognize these routes after taking over from them. What about the dung and droppings of the cattle along the routes? As life-long professional herdsmen, they are astute at recognizing these droppings which look like manure along the routes. Unable to follow the route for grazing, the herdsman then moves into farms and any available green space with his cattle for grazing.\u201d\n\nResolving the herders-farmers clashes through legislation\n\nA source at the Ministry of Justice, explained: \u201cIn 2014, former Benue State governor Gabriel Suswan headed a committee to resolve the lingering clashes between herdsmen and farmers, mostly in central and southern Nigeria. Six years down the line, nothing has come out of the report and nerves are still frayed. At the moment, the position of the government will be legally driven.\u201d Only the courts can modify the decision of the government to resurrect the grazing routes, the source informed. According to him, \u2018we expect litigations. It is normal. In 1953, there was no Nigeria in the real sense. Such things could fly then, but not now. The ethnic and religious consciousness of the people has been awoken. The arms bearing by the Fulani herdsmen has also deepened the problem and put other Nigerians on edge. Perhaps, if they were not carrying arms, the sensitivity would have not been like this. So we await claims and litigations. The grazing reserves and stock routes are on the concurrent list in the 1999 constitution. So the issue of a presidential veto cannot arise if a modified bill is sent to him from the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the laws and the constitution are often observed in the breach. The citizens prefer to follow the leader and his body language. He explains further: \u201cIn America, it is America first. In Nigeria, it is the leader first.\u201d But he declined to affirm the nature, tempo and details of the law being planned although he rationalized it by quoting the late politician, Tony Anenih, that \u201ceverybody will leave the drawing board happy.\u201d\n\nHe also brushed aside the insinuations that cattle herding is a private business and should not attract government funding or intervention. His argument: \u201cIn various states of the country, farmers enjoy government fertilizer free. Is that one not private business? So what\u2019s wrong in government intervening financially in cattle rearing since it is causing problems in the country?\u201d Insisting that a fair view will help in providing solutions to the protracted problem, he reechoed some of the oft-expressed effusions of the apologists of Fulani herdsmen crises, saying: \u201cIn the amalgamation of nations, your landmass determines the sea mass. The sea reserves in the south are as a result of the landmass in the north equated at nautical miles. This is a different argument entirely. We should be able to perfect routes where these animals will go through. The issue of the cross-border Fulani is also important to be addressed. There is no clear demarcation in the north showing borders. They only put ropes to show the difference between countries. No formal borderline as opposed to the south. When you say \u2018border closed,\u2019 can you close an open border? Some of the Fulani don\u2019t know where they are from. The truth of the matter is that the herdsmen you see with the cattle are not the owners. The owners are the northern elite. They are in the background. They are the ones who are arming them to protect their stock because cattle are money.\u201d\n\nGoing further, he reminded Nigerians that the Attorney General of the Federation is not vested with powers to originate laws on the concurrent list. He said: \u201cWhen the states fail to make the laws, then federal laws will be binding on them.\u201d On a concluding note, he expressed optimism that the crises over cattle will fizzle away soon. \u201cThere will be no war. It will die a natural death in some months to come. The style of a leader often dictates the nature of governance and set-up. Some leaders prefer the use of force in attaining goals. Some prefer dialogue. Others just float with the times and the subjects adjust to his aura and things sort themselves out,\u201d he predicted. For Alhaji Gidado Siddiki, Southeast Zonal Chairman of MACBAN, \u201cany move that will douse the tension in the land is welcome.\u201d\n\nStates rev into action\n\nSeveral states in Nigeria\u2019s north have swung into action to re-open abandoned grazing reserves. At the last count, Katsina, Bauchi, Kano, Borno, Yobe and Niger have taken the lead in the revival process. In Katsina, over 2000km of cattle routes have been reclaimed. The Special Adviser to the governor on Livestock and Grazing Reserves, Dr. Lawal Bagida who spoke on the subject, said: \u201cWe already have a committee here, which has worked by marking the routes which have been gazetted.\u201d The routes are marked out using beacons. The state has also earmarked and gazetted 123,000 hectares of land for grazing.\n\nIn Bauchi, a machinery has been set in motion to revive the routes. In October 2020, ahead of the presidential directive, the state released a White Paper on the report of the Administrative Committee of Inquiry into a land dispute between farmers and herdsmen in Misau Local Government Area which recommended revocation of all lands illegally acquired by farmers and other persons and to reestablish grazing reserves and reopen all the cattle routes in the state. Kano State has announced that its grazing reserves and routes are functional and have never been closed. The State Commissioner for Information, Mallam Muhammadu Garuba said efforts are on to ensure that the presidential directive is not breached in any way.\n\nOwing to the fear of insurgency, the reopened routes and grazing reserves in Borno State have been abandoned. The Director, State Nomadic Education Directorate, Gambo Abasuwa Tom, said: \u201cthe routes were of different types, including local routes that linked one community to another within the state, interstate routes, as well as international routes which were in existence for a long period of time. Insurgency has displaced most of the pastoralists, while the majority of them have migrated to neighbouring states and countries. The state wants help from all concerned to restore normalcy and demarcate the routes.\u201d The routes were known by the pastoralists, community leaders, and policymakers before the advent of insurgency, the commissioner said.\n\nYobe State has, so far, recovered 31 international routes in Gujba LGA, the chairman of the Local Government Area, Alhaji Dala Mala has announced. While the State Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Breeders Association, (MACBAN) Alhaji Sarkin Shuwa described the presidential order as long awaited, the chairman of the Farmers Association in the State, Aliu Mai Bindiga, lamented that his members lost over 70% of their produce to herders\u2019 invasion this year.\n\nThe situation in Niger is slightly difficult because of the heightened insecurity in the state. Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane said the state will opt for ranching after banditry in the state has been stamped out.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Nnamdi Kanu: IPOB, family raise fresh alarm",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Lagos, Okey Sampson, Umuahia And Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has threatened to cripple Nigeria should anything untoward happen to its leader, Nnamdi Kanu who is being detained by the Department of State Service (DSS).\n\nMedia and Publicity Secretary of the group, Emma Powerful gave the warning in a statement on Friday in Owerri even as he alleged that the DSS has refused the family access to see Kanu. He also alleged that Kanu\u2019s lawyer and personal physician were also being denied access to him.\n\nMeanwhile, the family has raised the alarm that the Federal Government is fabricating lies against the IPOB leader.\n\nIPOB said: \u201cThe Nigerian government and her wicked security agency, the Department of State Service have refused to allow our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyers and family access to him in the dungeon of DSS secret cell. It is now confirmed that their real intention in kidnapping him and bundling him back to Nigeria is to kill him.\n\n\u201cThe mission they could not actualise on September 14, 2017 when soldiers invaded his Afaraukwu home during Operation Python Dance is what they want to actualise now.\u201d\n\nPowerful claimed further that Kanu\u2019s health had been deteriorating in the DSS cell since he has refused to eat their food, almost one week after his incarceration.\n\n\u201cWe demand that DSS should allow him access to his lawyers and family members, for this is his lawful right. And his lawyers are being harassed and we pity them and Nigeria. If anything happens to our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu the Nigerian Government and security agencies must understand the product we are made of and how prepared we are.\n\n\u201cSouth East Governors and Ohanaeze, including politicians in the region must ensure that nothing bad happens to Nnamdi Kanu because Miyetti Allah and sympathisers of terrorists are going free in the country but ordinary persons and innocent citizens are being molested everyday because they are Biafrans. We won\u2019t accept that.\n\n\u201cWe also want to tell the DSS to jettison any plans to inject our leader with poisonous vaccine that will make him die slowly. Any such attempt will come with unimaginable consequences! Nnamdi Kanu must not die in custody.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani- controlled Federal Government of Nigeria and DSS should release our leader for international medical check up. He must have access to his doctors to ascertain his current health status since he was abducted and tortured by the security agents.\n\n\u201cWe declare without equivocations that the Nigerian Government should not take our calmness for granted. Should anything untoward happen to our leader while in detention or even after, we will totally cripple Nigeria and its government.\u201d\n\nIPOB has also claimed that Kanu is presently being tortured in his cell since he was locked up.\n\n\u201cOur intelligence units are following up events, including the torture being meted out to him since his abduction. The world should see how the wicked Nigerian government is provoking us.\n\n\u201cWhile Boko Haram terrorists and bandits maiming and killing indigenous Nigerians in their ancestral lands are made to go free, and even the few captured ones are released and given cash after sumptuous treatment in detention, an innocent freedom fighter is made to languish in detention.\u201d\n\nThe family of the arrested Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, Nnamdi Kanu, now in the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS), has accused the Federal Government of lying against him with regard to the circumstances surrounding his arrest and the country in which it took place. As far as the family is concerned, the IPOB leader was abducted by the Federal Government, through unconventional means.\n\nSpokesman of the family, Emmanuel Kanu, Nnamdi\u2019s younger brother, who broke his silence against the backdrop of the conflicting reports of how and where the IPOB leader was arrested, described the news flying about as fake and called on Nigerians not to believe it. He noted that it was orchestrated by the Federal Government to serve as distractions in order to \u201ccover their shame.\u201d\n\nHis allegations against Federal Government\n\nHe accused the Federal Government of lying to Nigerians and the entire world with regard to the country where his brother was arrested, adding that the family and IPOB are waiting for the government to \u201cfinish messing themselves up\u201d before they will tell the world the truth.\n\nHe remarked: \u201cThe FG said they re-arrested Nnamdi Kanu somewhere in East Africa. Later, they changed the narrative and said they picked him up somewhere in Addis Ababa. Somewhere along the line, they equally said they abducted him in UK. We want to allow them to continue jumping from one tree to another, but they must explain to the world where they abducted him. Like I said, we have the facts and figures\u201d.\n\nReacting to the rumoured luring of the IPOB leader with a woman, Emmanuel responded: \u201cWas it not the same thing they said the last time they arrested him? The Federal Government can go about saying whatever they like. Now, if Nnamdi Kanu is seen with a woman, is that supposed to be an issue? What has it got to do with the struggle?\u201d\n\nHe accused the Anglican Bishop of Enugu of buying into the lie of the Federal Government on the issue and advised him to get all the facts about the matter before speaking on it. \u201cHe should have waited a bit to understand what happened. So, my sincere advice to him in the future is that he shouldn\u2019t be in a hurry to make any statement he will regret later. That is my honest advice to him. He got it wrong and I\u2019m glad he apologized, indirectly, for what he said.\u201d\n\nHe described as \u201ctissues of lies\u201d the allegation that the IPOB leader travelled to the Czech Republic to negotiate for arms or travelled to an East African country to collect money before he was arrested.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question remains: what facts do you have to support your allegation that Nnamdi Kanu travelled to buy arms? Produce your evidence before the court and let\u2019s see. And for those saying he went to collect money, when he was in prison, they promised him heaven and earth, but he rejected them. Those allegations are rubbish.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain why Nnamdi Kanu should travel out of the United Kingdom and thereby make himself vulnerable to re-arrest, Emmanuel retorted: \u201cAre you saying that he is not free to go to wherever he wants to go? That shouldn\u2019t even come into play. He is free to go wherever he wants. The fact remains that they picked him up without following due process.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel wants the Federal Government to apologise to his brother because, according to him, he had, long before now renounced his Nigerian citizenship, and was therefore, wrongly arrested because he is not a Nigerian citizen.\n\nFear, anxiety grip Afara Ukwu community\n\nAway from the family, the mood elsewhere in Afara Ukwu is that of uneasy calm, sadness and fear of the unknown. They so much pervade the community of the arrested leader of the IPOB. When Saturday Sun visited the community, the people were unwilling to speak on his arrest, ostensibly, out of fear. The few who did asked that their names should not be mentioned.\n\nAsked about the feelings of his people, the President-General of the community, said, laconically: \u201cNobody is happy.\u201d But he rebuffed entreaties to speak further, saying that he was going for a meeting somewhere and was in a hurry to get there.\n\nAnother resident who spoke on the subject matter disclosed that they have been under what may be described as a military siege, since after the arrest of the IPOB leader. \u201cThe way we cannot tell the fate of our son, Nnamdi, is the same way we cannot say what our own fate is as soldiers have been patrolling our community on regular basis since his arrest,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough they are not harassing or molesting anybody physically, they are doing so psychologically by subjecting us to a kind of mental torture with their presence.\u201d\n\nLike the President-General of the community noted before hurriedly taking his leave, during his chat with the reporter, the people are in sombre mood. \u201cEverybody is worried, nobody is happy,\u201d another resident said repeating the man, word-for-word. \u201cEven our Hausa friends are equally worried. One of them even called in to express his worry.\u201d\n\nIPOB leader seeks UK\u2019s assistance\n\nThe embattled leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has appealed to the British government to help him regain freedom from the Nigerian government.\n\nIn a letter by his counsel, Aloy Ejimakor of Adulbert Legal Services, Abuja, entitled, \u201cRe: Urgent Request For Consular Assistance To Okwu-Kanu, Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny (A British Citizen)\u201d, to Catriona Laing CB, British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Abuja, which was dated June 30, and made available to Saturday Sun, Kanu is asking to be granted every possible Consular assistance to which he is entitled as a British citizen.\n\nThe letter reminded the High Commissioner that the IPOB leader is also the director of Radio Biafra, with both station and IPOB being corporate citizens of Britain.\n\nAccording to the letter, Kanu was residing in the United Kingdom, from which soil he departed on an overseas travel on or about June 19, 2021 on a British Passport No: 556543086.\n\n\u201cWe are reliably informed that while he was on the said overseas travel, he was intercepted in Kenya by Nigeria\u2019s foreign security agents and brought to Nigeria against his will on or about June 27, 2021 and \u2018arraigned\u2019 before the Federal High Court in Abuja without the benefit of counsel on June 29, 2031. Currently, he is being detained in the custody of the Directorate of State Security Services (DSS) in Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe letter further noted that there were legal, political and diplomatic issues implicated in this matter.\n\n\u201cThey are: Mr. Kanu is a British citizen, who was travelling on a valid British passport when he was seized in a third country and forcibly brought to Nigeria. Such act constitutes an unlawful rendition of a bonafide British citizen.\n\n\u201cHe was not travelling on Nigerian passport or the passport of any other country, including that of Kenya.\n\n\u201cThere is no extant order of extradition by any British Court or any other foreign court (including Kenya) and we are informed that there is no pending extradition proceedings standing against him in Britain or Kenya.\n\n\u201cThere is no deportation Order by any Kenyan Court or other authority that made him subject to deportation. But if there was, the country of his deportation should have been Britain on which passport he was travelling. Deporting him to Nigeria just because he was born in Nigeria, but not travelling on her passport, is unlawful under international law.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise upon which Mr Kanu is engaged, which is: seeking the restoration of the defunct State of Biafra through a referendum is a protected political opinion (i.e self determination) under British and Nigerian Laws, where it is enacted at CAP A9, Article 20, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the manner of his interception and forcible deportation to Nigeria is extra-legal and does not comport with the pertinent international laws and treaties to which Nigeria is subject,\u201d the letter emphasised.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the IPOB leader is asking to be categorized as a high profile political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience and be thus rendered the highest diplomatic protection under municipal and international laws.

          "title": "Shettima Calls for Power Shift to South, Insists on Rotation",
          "text": "\u2022Maintians there was a gentleman agreement on rotation in APC\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFormer Borno State Governor, Senator Kashim Shettima has thrown his weight behind the call for power shift to Southern Nigeria in 2023.\n\nHe said it was only proper for the North, especially the All Progressives Congress (APC), to allow power to shift to the South, insisting that there was a gentlemen\u2019s agreement that power must oscillate between North and South at the formation of the ruling party.\n\nShettima, who is now a Senator representing Borno Central, made the call for a power shift in Abuja yesterday at the public presentation of a book titled: \u201cStanding for the Truth with Courage\u201d.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cAfter power has resided in the North for eight years, the minimum is that there should be a power shift to the South for equity and justice. We are against oppression and marginalisation by any one group against another.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman agreement in the APC at its formative stage for power to rotate between the North and the South. And even in the colony of thieves, there exist a code of moral behaviour.\n\n\u201cJust because we are politicians, how can we believe anything goes?. NO!!! We should have minimal thresholds below which we shouldn\u2019t operate. President Buhari with his 12 million votes could not become the President on three attempts until we had a handshake across the river. We are an honourable people and we have to honour our commitment to that pact.\n\n\u201cThe minimum is for a power shift to Southern Nigeria, unless the advocates of power retention have a hidden agenda for the dismemberment of the nation. And to be fair to the President, he has neither endorsed nor showed a preference for any of the gladiators.\n\n\u201cWith all sense of modesty, if there\u2019s any title for a political godson, I can comfortably claim to be President Buhari\u2019s eldest political son. In both the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections, President Buhari garnered the highest quantum of votes, percentage-wise, not in his native Katsina State; not in Kaduna where he calls home for the past five decades; certainly not in Kano with a substantial Daurawa community nor Jigawa with his filial ties to neighbouring Kazaure Emirate. The President got the highest percentage of votes in Borno, where he garnered 97% in 2015 and 95% in 2019, followed by our sister state of Yobe.\u201d\n\nHe advised political gladiators across the country to give ear to his call, noting that: \u201cAs the Igbos would say, \u201cIf a child washes his hands, he could eat with kings\u201d. We have truly washed our hands and we are a major stakeholder in the Nigeria project. I believe we have a right to air our views and be listened to.\u201d\n\nHe said in his remarks at the book launch that the hope of the country rests on the mindset of her people, adding that the problem was not religion or ethnicity but people using them to achieve their goals.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur problems are not that of religion or ethnicity. Religion has become a body of rituals devoid of any practical value. People use religion to advance their interests \u2013 we have God on our lips and devil in our hearts.\n\n\u201cNo religion sanctions oppression. The hope for the black man rests not on South Africans or Kenyans. The hope for the black man rests with the people of this country.\u201d\n\nHe warned: \u201cWe have to make this country work. Our country of 211 million people, if this country is to implode, where are we going to go? Down is the Atlantic Ocean? Up is the Niger Republic? The population of the Niger Republic is not up to the population of Kano State. We are going to eat up the entire food reserves of the Niger Republic under two weeks. To our eastern side are the mountain ranges of Cameroon and the Central African Republic. They too have been contending with their problems.\n\n\u201cOn our western sides are the tiny states of Benin Republic, Togo, and Ghana. How can they contain us? I told some western ambassadors that if this country is to implode, we are not going to go through Libya. Our people will storm Europe through Morocco.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIf just two million Syrians knocking on the doors of Europe have brought about Brexit and the emergence of Trump in America, what do you say of about 25 million English speaking Nigerians knocking on the doors of Europe? It would cause reverberations. I believe in equity, justice, and fairness.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the book launch, the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, called for unity and peaceful co-existence of Nigerians.\n\nHe said the best way to guarantee the unity of Nigeria was for all the people to come together while commending Joe Gadzama for using his experience to illustrate in his book the importance of standing for truth.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are going through difficult times in our country, economic and security, but let us recognise that the whole world is going through the same challenge.\n\n\u201cNigeria is part of the world. But the leadership under which we operate shows we shall indeed overcome all these. If we keep united, keep building, we cannot be ignored by any other country in the world.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that under the leadership of President Buhari, there is going to be a better future. He belongs to all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Lagos is host on Monday as Sanwo-Olu pledges cordial engagement\n\nSegun James\n\nSeventeen governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states will on Monday converge on Lagos for the second time this year to continue their search for solution to the myriad of problems confronting the country.\n\nAt the last meeting, hosted by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and attended by 15 of the 17 southern governors, they arrived at a 12-point resolution, which included the banning of open grazing in all the states.\n\nSources said the meeting on Monday in Lagos would examine the progress made regarding the Asaba Declaration, examine oppositions to some of the demands and come up with a better strategy for actualising the demands.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe governors are working towards a better Southern Nigeria within the Nigerian nation. This meeting is in continuation of that agenda. It is a continuation of the meeting held in Asaba. The southern governors will be looking at the gains of the last meeting and come up with their next move.\n\n\u201cYou know the southern governors agreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken towards the restructuring of the Nigerian federation leading to the devolution of power.\n\nThey want inclusive government at the federal level, state police, a review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments, and creation of some other institutions, which will legitimately advance commitment to the practice of true federalism. Strategies are needed to actualise all these. This is why they are meeting again in Lagos.\u201d\n\nAnother source close to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is chief host, said in the spirit of Lagos hospitality, the Lagos governor has promised to provide a conducive environment for the 17 governors to brainstorm properly.\n\nDuring the first meeting in Asaba, the southern governors resolved to ban all forms of open grazing in the southern states of the country.\n\nAlthough, the governors came short of calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to reshuffle heads of top agencies to reflect federal character against the backdrop of the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nature of Nigeria, they urged the President to ensure that the sensibilities of the people were respected and reflected in federal appointments.\n\nWhile affirming the commitment of the peoples of Southern Nigeria to \u201cthe unity of the country on the basis of fairness, equity and oneness,\u201d the governors expressed grave concern about the security challenge plaguing the country and charged the President to act decisively to address the situation.\n\nSpecifically, the governors of the southern states called on President Buhari to convoke a national conference to address the insecurity and other challenges in order to restore the confidence of the citizens in the Nigerian geo-political entity.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said that the southern governors \u201cobserved that incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security.\u201d\n\nBut the federal government responded, saying the southern governors\u2019 proposed plan to enforce the ban on open grazing \u201cis of questionable legality.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says it\u2019s seeking clarification on circumstances of arrest\n\n\u2022Kenya denies involvement in capture\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe British Government yesterday refused to categorically accept or deny allegations that it assisted the leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, with another passport after he escaped from Nigeria.\n\nKanu was first arrested in Nigeria on October 14, 2015, following campaigns for the Sovereign State of Biafra and arraigned for treason. He was granted bail in April 2017 but fled the country. The IPOB leader was rearrested last Sunday in an unnamed country and returned to court to continue his trial.\n\nTHISDAY, in a series of email exchanges with the British High Commission in Abuja, had requested clarifications on how the IPOB leader obtained fresh British passport.\n\nIn the most recent email, THISDAY enquired: \u201cWe need some further clarification, please. Are you saying the British government did not assist Mr. Nnamdi Kanu in procuring a new British passport? The information we have is that after escaping from Nigeria through the land borders, the British government assisted him in procuring another passport in the High Commission of one of our neighbouring countries, knowing at the time he was a fugitive running away from justice in Nigeria. Do you categorically deny the British government involvement in this? In relation to (b), are you implying that since Mr. Kanu\u2019s trial was not in a British court, you do not reckon with the Nigerian court which impounded his passports?\u201d\n\nIn reaction, the High Commission said in order to respond to the question, it would need to send the email to \u201cLondon\u201d because \u201cit does not specially relate to the British High Commission in Nigeria unlike the question you clarified yesterday and which we have answered.\u201d\n\nDean Hurlock of the British High Commission, after referring the enquiry to \u201cLondon\u201d, sent the reply yesterday and it read: \u201cWe are seeking clarification about the circumstances of the arrest from the Nigerian government. Our policy on issuing passports to those who are entitled to them is clear and publicly available; we are not going to discuss any individual case.\u201d\n\nOf course, the reply did not address the issues raised by THISDAY. Kanu could not have obtained a new British passport without the approval of the British Government.\n\nIn the earlier email, THISDAY enquired from the British High Commission: \u201cThe specific allegation we want addressed is whether the British High Commission assisted Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, whose Nigerian and British passports had been impounded by an Abuja court, in jumping bail by issuing him another British passport which he used to travel out of Nigeria and had been using to travel until his re-arrest. How could Kanu have acquired another British travel document in Nigeria without processing it at your High Commission?\u201d\n\nJonathan Bacon of the British High Commission replied saying the question refers explicitly to British High Commission and that his response earlier directly addressed this allegation: \u201cWe can confirm that the British High Commission in Nigeria did not issue any travel documents for Mr Kanu. We therefore reaffirm the categorical denial sent to you yesterday. Your question (b) referred to London, hence my reply yesterday at 17:23 to say that I needed to ask London for a view on the question, and that given the time the email was sent, I might not receive a reply until the morning.\u201d\n\nKenya Denies Involvement in Arrest, Repatriation of Kanu\n\nMeanwhile, Kenya High Commissioner to Nigeria, Ambassador Wilfred Machage has denied the involvement of his government in the arrest and extradition of the IPOB leader.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, had said the IPOB leader was \u201cintercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and security services abroad\u201d, but he did not disclose the country where Kanu was arrested.\n\nKanu\u2019s family later alleged that the IPOB leader was arrested in Kenya with the aid of the Kenyan government and returned to Nigeria. Some publications also reported that the Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was privy to Kanu\u2019s extradition.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, Machage, dismissed all the allegations and challenged anyone with evidence linking his country to the incident to produce it.\n\nHe described as \u201cunfortunate and libelous\u201d the linking of President Kenyatta to Kanu\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe Kenyan High Commissioner said the allegation was \u201cconcocted\u201d to pitch Nigerians in the South-east against Kenyans.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to address this allegation by denying that Kenya was involved in the alleged arrest in Kenya and extradition to Nigeria of Mr. Kanu. To us, therefore, these allegations are fictional, imaginary, and deliberately concocted to fuel antagonistic feelings among a certain section of the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cI want to challenge anyone with facts relating to this alleged arrest in Kenya to present those facts. This includes when, where, how, and who was particularly involved in the alleged arrest.\n\n\u201cI wish to categorically state that we are not happy at this ridiculous attempt at dragging the name of Kenya and President Uhuru Kenyatta in this matter of arrest and extradition of the self-proclaimed IPOB leader.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a sovereign country. It\u2019s your country. Instead of facing the Kenyan High Commission in Nigeria to ask some of these questions, you should face your government. The government of Nigeria knows how they arrested him. They have the answers, not me.\u201d\n\nHe said the government and people of Kenya were also \u201cdisturbed, dismayed and astonished by the unfortunate statement on the alleged arrest of Kanu in Kenya.\u201d\n\nMachage added: \u201cThe Government of Kenya is particularly appalled by the spurious, derogatory, and libelous mention of our dear President on this matter as has been reported.\n\n\u201cI, as the High Commissioner of the Republic of Kenya to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, wish to categorically emphasise that our country, Kenya, continues to enjoy cordial diplomatic relations with both the Federal Government of Nigeria and its great accommodating and amiable citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Kenya \u201cis committed to sustaining the historical bond of friendship between the two countries and further cement diplomatic relations with the view to ensuring beneficial relations.\u201d\n\nHe urged that Kenya should not be dragged into the issue as she has no question to answer but rather that the citizens of Nigeria should approach the Nigerian government for an explanation of where Kanu was arrested.\n\nLast Thursday, Kenya\u2019s Director-General of Immigration Services, Alexander Muteshi, also dismissed the claim that Kanu was arrested in his country.\n\nWhile on the run, Kanu piloted the affairs of IPOB from abroad, and after his re-arrest, the federal government arraigned him before the Federal High Court in Abuja, where a judge granted the Department of State Services (DSS) permission to keep him in its custody until July 26 when his trial would continue. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, Machage, dismissed all the allegations and challenged anyone with evidence linking his country to the incident to produce it.\n\nHe described as \u201cunfortunate and libelous\u201d the linking of President Kenyatta to Kanu\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe Kenyan High Commissioner said the allegation was \u201cconcocted\u201d to pitch Nigerians in the South-east against Kenyans.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to address this allegation by denying that Kenya was involved in the alleged arrest in Kenya and extradition to Nigeria of Mr. Kanu.

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nSenator Kabir Marafa, a leader of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State has described the defection of Governor Mohammed Bello Matawalle to the APC, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as a violation of the Supreme Court judgment, which declared that the APC had no candidate in the 2019 governorship election in Zamfara State.\n\nThe lawmaker of the Eight Senate in an interview on ARISE News, warned that if strong reservations expressed by the party members over the defection were not managed properly, they might snowball into a major crisis that would rock the very foundation of the party.\n\nJustifying his opposition to Matawalle\u2019s defection, Marafa stated: \u201cThe judgment made by the Supreme Court said APC ought not to have participated in the 2019 election. What that means is that there was no APC at all. Now, I\u2019m asking this question and I want every Nigerian to tell me: Can a man that is non-existent give birth to children? No, he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGiving further clarifications on the Supreme Court judgment, Marafa said, \u201cAs far as the law is concerned, there was no APC in the 2019 ballot paper, so APC cannot have a governor, APC cannot have senators, APC cannot have members of House of Representatives and APC cannot have members of the state\u2019s house of assembly, according to that Supreme Court judgment.\n\n\u201cSo, any attempt by anybody to say he is the governor of APC, between 2019 and 2023 without reason of death or resignation that could have warranted issues of bye-election, cannot work. Doing so is acting against the judgment of the Supreme Court. You are making nonsense of our judicial system. These issues are going to come up.\u201d\n\nIn what appears to be a sign of cracks in the ranks of the APC in Zamfara, Marafa distanced himself from the defection of the state governor, saying \u201cWe have accepted our fate. We are the ones that fought, we lost and we have accepted that in good fate. \u201cLeave us where we are. You don\u2019t have to rub it on us. Doing so will just ignite series of problems that might spell doom to APC. We don\u2019t want it to happen, so, what people are saying is APC be fair, be just.\u201d\n\nHe also stated why he believes Matawalle should not be the leader of the APC in Zamfara State.\n\nHe insisted that the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the APC, Mai Mala Buni, erred by announcing Matawalle as the leader of the party in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cAPC should let the sleeping dog lie. Mai Mala Buni, Chairman of its Caretaker Committee doesn\u2019t have the power under the constitution to make such pronouncements,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "FairMoney, like many other Nigerian fintechs, started out in the lending business and is about completing its evolution into being a full-fledged digital bank.\n\nToday it announced a $42 million Series B round. It was led by Tiger Global Management with existing investors like DST Partners, Flourish Ventures, Newfund, and Speedinvest participating.\n\nThe investment comes after FairMoney raised $11 million Series A two years ago and $16 million in total within its first four years.\n\nFor Tiger Global which led the round, this is its fourth investment in an African startup after iRoko (2013), Takealot (2014) and Flutterwave (2021). Notably, this is the first time the investment firm is investing in two African startups within a year. A sign of its renewed interest in the African continent after a long hiatus.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with FairMoney as they build a better financial hub for customers in Nigeria and India,\u201d Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, said in a statement. \u201cWe were impressed by the team and the strong growth to date and look forward to supporting FairMoney as they continue to scale.\u201d\n\nFairMoney\u2019s Performance\n\nFounded in 2017 by Laurin Hainy, Matthieu Gendreau, and Nicolas Berthozat, FairMoney started its operations in Nigeria before expanding to India last year.\n\nFrom having a little over 100,000 users in its first year of operation, FairMoney has grown to have 1.3 million unique users who have made more than 6.5 million loan applications. Last year, the company disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million.\n\nWithin the short time its being in India, the company has processed more than 500,000 loan applications from over 100,000 unique users.\n\nThis year, FairMoney achieved one of its crucial goals by acquiring a microfinance bank license in Nigeria. The license allows FairMoney to operate as a financial service provider in Nigeria.\n\nLooking forward\n\nComing off a fantastic 2020, the company says it is projecting to disburse $300 million worth of loans this year. It\u2019ll finance this by raising bonds.\n\nFairMoney has come a long way since it started as a credit provider, it\u2019s ambition according to co-founder Laurin Hainy is that \u201cby the end of the year, its customers will have a full-fledged banking experience from P2P transfers and lending to debit cards and current accounts.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also working on a number of additional services including savings, stock trading, and crypto-trading products. These are subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nWith this new funding, rather than expanding into other countries, FairMoney wants to focus and consolidate its position in Nigeria and India. While it\u2019s not expanding further geographically, its talent pool is, with about 150 open positions.\n\nFairMoney is not alone in its ambitions to dominate the Neobank scene in Nigeria, Kuda in March raised $25 million.\n\nWith more players coming onto the Neobank scene in Nigeria, one might get a feel that it\u2019s a space that\u2019s getting crowded but the fact that about 56% of Nigerian adults are unbanked hints that there\u2019s room for many to play in this space.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor two children to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top students in the country and in the end, Faith Keza and another student were on their way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand. With the largest growing youth population in the world, a digitised Africa will be a sight to behold.\n\nWith Faith Keza, Irembo could be at the front of that movement.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Kenyan eCommerce startup, Copia Global, has announced the expansion of its services to Uganda. Having established its presence in the Kenyan market, where it claims to serve over one million customers, the startup has its sights on Uganda\u2019s growing middle class.\n\nCopia Global operates a different model from most eCommerce platforms. Rather than depending on a website, it uses a network of agents spread across the country. When customers need an item, they visit an agent with a digital device to place their order.\n\nAfter placing their order, the agent sends it to Copia Global, who processes and delivers it within two days when the customer returns to pick it up. By adopting this model, the company can serve people who do not own digital devices or cannot access the Internet. Interestingly, it does all this using USSD technology.\n\nWhile the startup has a website, it is mainly for customers who live in urban areas. This way, they can order goods and have them delivered to people living in rural communities where Copia Global has agents.\n\nThis model is perfect for Uganda, where despite 47% of the population owning mobile subscriptions, only 12 million Ugandans use the Internet. However, its combination of an online and offline model is not exactly novel. In 2019, eCommerce giant, Jumia, partnered with Vivo Energy to use its service stations as pick-up and drop-off points for customers.\n\nAccording to Founder and Chairman, Tracey Turner, \u201cUganda has one of the fastest-growing middle classes in the world with a hardworking population and a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. Copia is designed specifically to serve this high growth but underserved consumer base who want access to high-quality products at the best prices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, the startup has raised $53 million in funding from investors, including LGT Lightstone, Endeavor Catalyst, and Goodwell Investments.\n\neCommerce startups in Africa have primarily struggled to show a viable market for their services, with Konga sold in 2018 and Jumia\u2019s business struggling despite listing on the New York Stock Exchange. While models like Copia Global\u2019s that seek to serve low-income consumers might seem like the way to go, eCommerce startups need to serve a larger market to make as much revenue as the giants do.",

          "text": "OneWattSolar, a startup using digital solutions built on a Blockchain platform to provide off-grid renewable energy has issued a \u20a610 billion ($24.33 million) bond to deploy clean energy across sub-Saharn Africa.\n\nAnnounced July 1, 2021, the Green Bond Issuance programme, includes a seven-year Green Sukuk issue of \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million).\n\nThe bond issuance was led by Comercio Partners, Lagos-based investment bank and supported by Nigerian Shari\u2019ah complaint fund manager, Marble Capital Limited.\n\nWe spoke with Jubril Adeojo, co-founder and COO of OWS and he says issuing bonds will help accelerate growth and \u201cattract institutional investors interested in investing in green economy\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, the kind of projects the company is embarking on requires long-term funding, making the bond issuance a logical move.\n\nInterestingly, this is the first Corporate Green Sukuk in Africa and the first Corporate Green Bond for an off-grid renewable energy project.\n\nAdeojo says OWS is setting a standard for corporate organisations hoping to get to issue a Green Sukuk Bond.\n\nWhen asked what qualified the company for the bond issuance, he attributed it to the bankable business model and track record in Nigeria\u2019s renewable energy space.\n\nHe also stated the role of Financial Sector Deepening Africa (FSD), \u2014 UK-funded development agency strengthening financial markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 in providing technical assistance to OWS.\n\nWhy Sukuk? The co-founder says it is to \u201cmake history and appeal to Islamic investors to participate in the issuance.\u201d\n\nOne company, several partners\n\nIn describing OWS\u2019s business model, Adeojo says it\u2019s like Uber, but for energy services.\n\n\u201cWe partner with a lot of solar companies across the continent that carry out installation and maintenance. What we do is to provide the hardware like, solar panels, inverters, and software to enable the hardware run seamlessly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are some of the software used by OWS to facilitate services like payments and monitoring.\n\nBreaking down the process of how OWS operates, Adeojo says there are brokers that source for clients and solar companies that install hardware.\n\nThrough this model he claims, the company creates jobs for young engineers.\n\nSupervised by the solar companies, these engineers can also be part of the installation process individually. In addition, they\u2019ll also be in charge of maintenance, meaning they\u2019ll keep earning as long as the installed hardware is in use.\n\nThe vision of the renewable energy company is to deploy 14,000 megawatts of off-grid renewable energy across sub-Saharan Africa to decarbonise the region\u2019s energy sector.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN) Fact Sheet on Climate Change, \u201cAfrica is the continent\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,\u201d with 0.8 metric tons of carbon emissions per capita in the year 2000.\n\nHowever, Adeojo says OWS has partnered with solar companies and installers to deploy over 50 megawatts of renewable energy across Nigeria.\n\nWith this issuance, the company can accelerate its vision of installing 14,000 megawatts of clean energy in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time an African startup has resorted to bonds for funding, it\u2019s a relatively new phenomenon.

          "text": "As the pace of innovation in the African tech ecosystem ramps up, more attention would be given \u2014 and for a good reason \u2014 to the brave founders and innovators building Africa\u2019s future. However, angel investors and venture capitalists are a similarly courageous group of individuals who are seldom celebrated.\n\nTwice a month, we speak with an angel investor or venture capitalist backing Africa\u2019s innovators to draw insights from them. For this week\u2019s edition, I talked to Stewart Glynn, a Partner at TEN13, an Australian venture capital firm.\n\nGlynn grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital and most populous city, in an entrepreneurial family. When it was time for university, he went to Australia to gain a degree in business, banking, and finance at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nAfter that, he worked with General Electric and KPMG. During this time, he did a lot of work around helping businesses develop sustainable structures and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis time in the corporate sector exposed him to technology and its disruptive effects in various industries. He was approached by Steve Baxter, \u2018Shark\u2019 on Shark Tank, and an Australian serial entrepreneur who founded SENet and Pipe Networks, which was acquired for about $400 million.\n\nBaxter had started investing in technology startups through his family\u2019s office, Transition Level Investments, but wanted to do more and so he tapped Glynn. Together, they invested in about 40 ventures around the world.\n\nIn December 2019, after wondering how to institutionalise their investments, Baxter and Glynn decided to start TEN13. Having seen the value that Baxter could bring with his experience as a founder, they chose to do things differently.\n\nRather than raise a seed fund, TEN13 has a network of over 200 entrepreneurs and corporate executives who supply more than funds to the startups that they invest in. These investors provide the companies with an extensive network and advice as they navigate their startup journeys. Investments at TEN13 are made on a deal by deal basis.\n\nSince its launch in the last 18 months, TEN13 has deployed about $20 million in 13 startups, including Australian edtech unicorn, Go1; fintech startup, ImaliPay; and Africa- focused fintech unicorn, Chipper Cash.\n\nAccording to Glynn, the idea is to get behind visionary founders at the earliest stage and provide them with the resources to take their companies to the next level. The average ticket size is between $250,000 and $1 million, with the possibility of more investment further down the road.\n\nOn bad investments and common mistakes founders make\n\nFor now, Glynn explains that the goal is to fund ten companies every year. An arduous task, as he claims they get about 70 to 80 startups looking for funding monthly. When I asked if there were any deals they had missed out on that hurt, he explained it is the norm in venture capital.\n\n\u201cIn our game, it\u2019s really about having a framework for decision making because as early-stage investors, you\u2019re making decisions with limited data. As an investor, you want to see a lot of companies in the anti-portfolio because that means you are seeing the right deals,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn investor\u2019s anti-portfolio are the deals which they pursued but did not invest in, either of their own volition or because other investors shut them out.\n\nAccording to research, nine out of 10 startups fail. Knowing this, I asked Glynn how TEN13 deals with investments that do not go according to plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as a bad investment. We understand that while the companies we back have a high potential for success, there\u2019re a lot of reasons why startups fail. When we invest in startups, we provide support for the founders to ensure that the startups have a good chance of success,\u201d he says.\n\nMost founders have grand plans to take on the world at the early stage, but without previous startup experience, they are likely to make mistakes. Glynn advises that this is the point when they need to narrow their focus and not spread themselves too thin \u2014 something they make sure these startups know.\n\nInstead, he advises that they identify one thing that would put them on the right path and focus on doing it for the next three to six months.\n\nHow to reach TEN13\n\nFor founders looking to get TEN13 on board as investors, he recommends that they reach out via email [email protected] or LinkedIn. He stresses that they are sector-agnostic and back founders who are building products for a global market. With a renewed focus on emerging markets, he recommends that founders in these markets building remarkable products should reach out to him.",

          "title": "Microblogging and the Nigerian State: Matters Arising",
          "text": "The Nigerian government\u2019s suspension of the use of Twitter, a microblogging platform has resurfaced questions around the growth of information technology and how it can best be deployed for the greater good of the many.\n\nThe vice president, Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) recently declared that the Nigerian government is ready to introduce a new mechanism to widen the tax net.\n\nThis mechanism involves the collection of taxes on the Nigerian income of global technology giants not based in the country, but with significant economic presence. According to Section 4 of the Finance Act 2019, \u201cthe finance minister, may by the order of the president, determine what constitutes the significant economic presence of a company other than a Nigerian company\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian government is set to utilize this legal provision by taxing profits made in the country by global technology and digital firms such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix, among others.\n\nOver the years, efforts have been made to widen the tax net, including the creation of the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), which was an attempt to bring more people into the tax net, and hiking the VAT rate from 5.0 percent to 7.5 percent.\n\nRead Also: How Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban will stifle digital ecosystem\n\nNotably, total tax revenue increased by 59.1 percent to N5.3 trillion between 2016 and 2019. However, due to COVID-19 and the resultant effects on the economy, tax revenues declined by 5.8 percent to N4.9tn in 2020, driving an urgent need to broaden the tax base.\n\nThe storm and the teacup\n\nThe problem of the power of social media, as a product of private enterprise, remains a prickly global issue as governments\u2019 worldwide struggle to establish the balance between individual rights and social responsibility.\n\nWhile governments have been accused of muzzling free speech, social media entrepreneurs commit the same offence with less or no public outrage.\n\nOn Friday, June 04, 2021, at about 04:34 PM (WAT) the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) through the minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of the use of Twitter in Nigeria. The announcement first appeared on the ministry\u2019s Twitter handle @FMICNigeria and cited the use of the platform for activities that were capable of undermining the country\u2019s corporate existence as a reason for the suspension.\n\nHowever, Nigerians generally believed that the government responded to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by the Nigerian President where he was alleged to have threatened violence against a section of the country.\n\nThe President was alleged to have responded to the violence erupting in parts of the country by saying on June 01, 2021, that: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThis statement was believed by Twitter managers to be inappropriate and breached the company\u2019s policy on acceptable speech on its platform. In a swift reaction to the company\u2019s decision to delete the Nigerian President\u2019s tweet on its platform, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Information directed the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT (Over the Top) and social media operations in Nigeria and suspend the operations and use of Twitter in the country.\n\nRead Also: Digital entrepreneurship: a \u2018diamond in the rough\u2019 for SMEs in Nigeria\n\nLater that week, the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) confirmed that its members had received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the sector regulator, to suspend access to Twitter, while the attorney-general of the Federation (AGF) and minister of justice, Abubakar Malami had reportedly issued a statement ordering the prosecution of violators of the Twitter suspension order in Nigeria insisting that users of the platform would be prosecuted.\n\nThe presumption that social media is a socially and politically neutral platform for societal conversation is false. Owners of microblogging platforms have recognizable biases that range from the innocuous to the sinister and these biases could have severe consequences for social and political stability in different parts of the world.\n\nFrontier and emerging market economies appear to face the blunt force trauma of the biases of owners of microblogging platforms more powerfully than more mature countries.\n\nMore recently one of the most publicized battles with a social media platform was the bust-up between the United States of America\u2019s President Donald Trump and Twitter in which the social media platform banned the US President from using its platform to tweet until 2023.\n\nThe action of Twitter to bar the then US President inspired several global conversations over the power social media wielded and the capacity of the owners of social media to use it to shape the public conversation, perception, and action.\n\nWhile the Twitter ban could be seen as putting the US President in check over what generally were considered incendiary tweets, it showed that private enterprises managing social media platforms could wield enormous power over what societies consider acceptable or unacceptable speech or conduct, it hands such institutions a sword that could swing both ways.\n\nIt is this inherent capacity of social media enterprises to sway collective opinion and subtly affect people\u2019s decisions that make social media institutions as dangerous as they are liberating.\n\nNo Time for Excuses\n\nBe this as it may, the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s action to suspend microblogging platform Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was precipitated and clever by half.\n\nA local Nigerian adage says that the answer to a headache is not cutting off the head. The answer to Twitter\u2019s removal of a Nigerian Presidential Tweet that did not comply with the company\u2019s governance guidance should certainly not have been the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nIndeed, by the suspension, the government has highlighted its intolerance and its tendency to act before introspection, both characteristics unbefitting of an administration that claims to respect citizens\u2019 rights and the rule of law.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria conflicts with Chapter 2 section 22 of the Nigerian 1999 constitution as amended in 2011. The section declares that \u201cThe press, radio, television and other agencies of the mass media shall at all times be free to uphold the fundamental objectives contained in this Chapter and uphold the responsibility and accountability of the Government to the people\u201d.\n\nMicroblogs are channels by which media platforms hold governments accountable and so suspending such microblogs goes against the spirit of the country\u2019s constitution which guarantees citizen\u2019s access to information.\n\nConcerns about national security are valid but they must be viewed within the wider context of balancing national security interests with the rights of citizens to information. So far, this has been a delicate global trapeze trick. However, governments cannot use this as an excuse to plug the mouths and stop the keyboards of subscribers to social media.\n\nThe Twitter Red herring\n\nThe Twitter saga is an unfortunate diversion from major social issues such as the wantoning killing of Nigerians across the federation by marauding herdsmen. The killing of almost 50 citizens in Oyo state, another 100 citizens in Benue state, 3 citizens in Ogun state and 10 in Kaduna state within forty-eight (48) hideous hours camouflages behind the issue of a Twitter suspension.\n\nHowever, both issues are tangentially linked. Microblogging platforms provide Nigerians with up-to-the-minute information on human carnage going on across the country. The social media tool enables citizens to weigh national insecurity and the nature and effectiveness of the government\u2019s response.\n\nThe threat to Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence is not Twitter but the government\u2019s refusal to frontally address the issue of insecurity. The fact that the government wants to wish Twitter away does not resolve the existential challenge of a rampaging band of terrorists unleashing asymmetric war on the country.\n\nRather than spend time squandering local and international goodwill in fighting an obscure and relatively unimportant battle with Twitter, the federal government would do well to address the Goliath knocking the breath out of its credibility.\n\nThose celebrating the action as a show of might by Nigeria over a global tech giant are either naive, short-sighted or both. Nigeria and Nigerians would be better served if the country shows itself to be in control of the safety and livelihoods of its citizens and in control of its territorial borders than flexing muscles with a perceived digital enemy.\n\nA local adage suggests that the federal government has avoided finding an enduring cure for its festering ringworms (security and economic distress) as it casually continues to pick at its pimple (Twitter).\n\nThere is a place for ego and a place for temperance and good choices, Nigeria needs to shun the former and embrace the latter. Both physical security and enterprise security are of greater strategic importance than bruised tweets. The earlier the administration stops throwing red herrings the faster it can get to work on addressing Nigeria\u2019s more pressing problems.\n\nIn the light of these facts, BusinessDay analysts are of the opinion that, given the local reach of the technology giants, the mechanism can potentially yield some results \u2013 increasing the revenue contribution from tax and easing the burden on public debt. However, taking into account the recent Twitter ban, this may send unfriendly policy signals to foreign technology businesses and may have negative implications for already weak FDI flows.\n\nWe recommend that the government focuses more on the underlying causes of the country\u2019s weak tax base and implement policies to improve the ease of doing business, support business growth and attract foreign investors, which strengthens the tax base.",
          "summary": "While governments have been accused of muzzling free speech, social media entrepreneurs commit the same offence with less or no public outrage.\nHowever, Nigerians generally believed that the government responded to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by the Nigerian President where he was alleged to have threatened violence against a section of the country.\nThe presumption that social media is a socially and politically neutral platform for societal conversation is false.\nIt is this inherent capacity of social media enterprises to sway collective opinion and subtly affect people\u2019s decisions that make social media institutions as dangerous as they are liberating.\nHowever, governments cannot use this as an excuse to plug the mouths and stop the keyboards of subscribers to social media.",

          "title": "Oil region experts, leaders welcome PIB with cautious optimism",
          "text": "News of the historic passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (wholesome) since the past 20 years in the Senate on Thursday, July 1, 2021, has swept through the oil region with cautious optimism, but experts and leaders in the region have shown worry over what they call implementation shakedowns that often ruin good programmes in Nigeria.\n\nWhereas popular opinion insists on the 10 percent demanded by the south-south governors, industry insiders however, fear that the 3 percent is huge burden on the operational budget of oil companies and could serve as disincentive to investment in an era when the industry has for decades chased away investments.\n\nThe general consensus however, is that it is better to get the law going so that the good aspects can kick off while amendments can come later. It is good to operate the law and see how it goes, they say.\n\nIn the industry, the consensus seems to be that the region has no choice, nor luxury of time not to accept this. A source said: \u201cCrude is almost gone, oil companies at global level are transforming to energy companies, fossil oil is gone, gas has about a decade to flourish. So, no time for good or bad PIB. The consensus is that we run with this so as to exploit the much we can before we totally lose out and the PIB is the only way to allow private capital to come in.\n\nOthers say host community aspect is the most sensitive but that the 3 percent from every oil company\u2019s capital budget (capex) is better than nothing. \u201cRemember one percent on same capex already goes to the NDDC, one percent of contracts goes to Nigerian Content Board, FG remits to NDDC, 13 percent overall revenue goes to states, all GMOUs remittances go to Cluster Boards, etc. We can manage with these for now, if local accountability is there,\u201d they said.\n\nThey argue that the real gain is in freeing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to be a regulator while another national oil company will be an investor or operator. Now, the Minister is to have less interference in direct management of oil but still has huge powers in some areas. \u201cWe can always amend it along the journey, but it\u2019s good to start, after 20 years,\u201d they further said.\n\nSome say the government is simply passing the buck as it has the responsibility to develop the areas where its revenues come from.\n\nJoe Olobari (Ex-SPDC staff)\n\nThe devil is in the detail. While it seems a major win for host communities, the success or failure of the initiative lies in the modalities for administering such funds on a community to community basis.\n\nAs one who has been in the industry and one from a community in the Niger Delta, I have seen communities torn apart by mere expectations. Often, they turn round to blame the intervener.\n\nThis is critical because the 3 percent sliced off operators\u2019 budget to NDDC has had questionable success, for lack of a better expression.\n\nFrom the industry perspective, an additional three percent from the capex of each operator is quite a dip in investable fund in a region that is fast becoming less attractive.\n\nIt simply raises the cost of production of a barrel! You cannot do that when at the same time you are driving low production cost. It does appear that there is some disconnect with the realities of the industry. Or the\n\nThe Senate may be simply shying away from making government judiciously use funds for the development of communities from where the revenue it spends is derived.\n\nRead also: Oil rises near $69 as OPEC sees demand picking up\n\nEladebi Kingsley Egbuson (Economist)\n\n(Eguson is the current GM of Bayelsa Plastic Industry. He had worked at Business Development Capacity in Century Group known as CESL, and also in Belema Oil.)\n\nThe three per cent for host community is good enough for a start to test the waters. This is a taxation on oil firms; and it adds to the cost of Petroleum Profit Tax. The incident of taxation is predictable when it is a burden on the entrepreneur. Looking at PPT (Petroleum profit tax)\n\nIt is a tax on the income of companies engaged in upstream petroleum operations in lieu of CIT.\n\nAnother problem to arise from this three per cent which is not enough as agitated by the South-South representatives is how much of these communities are defined as host communities. Oil fields span across community frontiers. And where the flare or wells are located are just pin holes that drain from reservoirs that are large underneath several communities. Did the definition of host communities cater for such radius and effects as enormous as the environment apart from where the oil well is located?\n\nFor example, 51 percent of gas for Bonny LNG comes from Bayelsa, but is the host community definition in the bill catering for the gas drain from other states? Or do the gas installations in associated oil wells sufficient to define host communities in the PIB? I foresee increasing hostilities to this bill.\n\nLeesi Gborogbosi (CEO, Gabriel Domale Consulting)\n\n(Gborogbosi heads a Management Consulting Firm, and is an expert in finance, strategy, corporate governance, cost reduction, transformation and collaboration between host communities and oil companies)\n\nDr Leesi\n\nThe problem with politicians is that they never consult their people and the experts that they have. Participation by host communities should be based on total budget and not on budget class \u2013 because that will give room for flexibility by oil companies to their advantage.\n\nWhy are host communities given three per cent and not a minimum of 15 percent?\n\nWe are no more in the era of corporate social responsibilities of companies providing community projects. We are now in an era where host communities want to become strategic partners. They want to participate in the value chain of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIf the desire for stakeholders in the oil industry is to develop the oil and gas host communities, then the host communities must be given the preference and nurtured into full participation in the value generation and resource management in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThis is the time for collaborative relationship between host communities and oil companies.\n\nAs we continue to ignore host communities, we deliberately institutionalise non-collaborative behaviour.\n\nMany show the Indorama-Eleme Petrochemicals model as a success model to copy but in the company\u2019s supply chain, how many Eleme persons are driving trucks or in the trucking business?\n\nThey are not participating in the value chain \u2013 the supply chain.\n\nDarlington Nwauju (Spokesperson, Niger Delta Rights Advocates, NDRA\n\nOn the bright side of the passage of the five chapters & 319 paragraphs PIB, the regime of losses recorded in the industry will be checked. Records captured by the industry\u2019s anti-corruption agent, NEITI shows that\n\n$10.4billion or more has been lost to under remittances by IOCs due to lack of a structured governance framework in the Oil and Gas industry.\n\nAgain, the three per cent holder equity for the direct development of oil bearing communities is encouraging even though we would have wished for at least 5percent of such funds to help quicken the regeneration of the devastated Niger Delta environment.\n\nNext, the approval of 30 percent for the development of other frontiers will in no mean way awaken business opportunities and stimulate the local economy.\n\nOn the other hand, with the unbundling of the NNPC into a full business entity, market forces in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors will now determine prices and promote legal competition and activities that will trigger business opportunities. The implication of this of course is that prices of fossil fuel, domestic gas, DPK, AGO will certainly go high.\n\nThe NDRA therefore draws attention of the Executive to the likelihood of a spike in the prices of goods and services and government must therefore be proactive in the provision of palliative measures to mitigate large scale suffering of the masses.\n\nFinally, today\u2019s passage of the PIB also brings to an end 18years of wastage of tax payers\u2019 money by expenditure on consultations and retreats by the National Assembly over the Bill.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt is clear that with heavy awareness programme and steady communication system to explain the PIB provisions and with clear plans of seamless implementation, the bill and the law that follow would sell in the oil region. But, if conflict entrepreneurs get into the saddle ahead, the Bill may encounter community hitches.",

          "text": "After ending the year 2020 with a record 50 percent gain, the Nigerian stock market has been unable to sustain the momentum in the first half of 2021 as investors\u2019 appetite for stocks continues to wane on rising yields.\n\nCompared with peers, Nigerian stocks have underperformed with a YTD (year-to date) performance of -5.9 percent as against Ghana, Kenya and South Africa whose stocks were up 36.3 percent, 14 percent and 11.53 percent, respectively, in the first half of the year.\n\nYinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance, explains that unlike last year when interest rates were low and investors had to troop into the stock market, they have moved out this year as interest rates continue to rise.\n\nDespite the inflation rate that has slowed for the second successive month in May and oil price that touched its highest since 2018 at $76, it has been unable to spur investor\u2019s appetite for Nigerian equities as they are more interested in the fixed income space.\n\nHowever, while some companies have seen their share plunge significantly in the first half, some shares have rewarded investors with eye-popping gains.\n\nHere are the best performing stocks in the first half of 2021:\n\nLASACO Assurance\n\nLASACO\u2019s share price is the best performer as it stormed 329 percent higher in the first half of 2021 (H1 2021). The insurance and financial service company opened the year with a share price of N0.35 and rose to N1.50 as at June 3oth 2021.\n\nMorison Industries\n\nMorison\u2019s share price came next with a 186 percent gain in H1 2021. Morison began the year with a share price of N0.49 per share and closed its last trading day in June at N1.40 per share, ranking it second-best on the Nigerian exchange group in year-to-date performance.\n\nMorison Industries plc specialises in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical, hygiene and care products.\n\nRead also: International Breweries declares N 136.8bn revenue\n\nChampion Breweries\n\nThe Champion breweries share price came next with 144 percent gain. The beer maker\u2019s share opened the year at N0.86 and jumped to N2.1 as at June 30th 2021.\n\nSince Heineken\u2019s indirect acquisition of additional shares in Champion Breweries through Raysun Nigeria Limited on the 8th of January 2021, buying interest by investors have continued to prop the shares of the company.\n\nRoyal Exchange\n\nThe share price of Royal Exchange, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost financial services groups offering general and health insurance, also gained by 135 percent in H1 2021. The insurer\u2019s share price began the year at N0.26 and has surged to N0.61 in the review period.\n\nRegency Alliance Insurance\n\nRegency Alliance ranked the fifth best performer in H1 2021 with 109 percent gain. The insurance company began the year with a share price of N0.22 and surged to N0.46 per share on the last day of June 2021.\n\nVitafoam\n\nVitafoam\u2019s share price recorded a 97 percent gain in the first half of the year. The manufacturer of foam products saw its share price rise to N15.4 per share compared to N7.8 per share at the beginning of the year.\n\nConsolidated Hallmark\n\nConsolidated Hallmark Insurance\u2019s share price also gained 88 percent in the first half of 2021. The insurer\u2019s share price opened the year at N0.32, surging to N0.60 as of 30 June 2021.\n\nSeplat\n\nSeplat shares have gained 72 percent, ranking it 8th among the top performers in terms of year-to-date performance.\n\nAs oil prices continue to rebound, investor\u2019s buying interest resumed and this pushed Seplat\u2019s shares up to N690 per share as at June 30th 2021 from an opening price of N402 per share.\n\nLinkage Assurance\n\nLINKASSURE began the year with a share price of N0.52 and has since gained 61.54 percent on that price valuation, ranking it 9th on the NSE in terms of year-to-date performance. This stock gained 40 percent in the last one month alone\n\nMutual Benefits Assurance\n\nMBenefit ranked the 10th on the NSE in terms of year-to-date performance with 59.26 percent gain. The insurance company began the year with a share price of N0.27 and surged to N0.43 per share as at June 30th 2021.\n\nOther stocks that outperformed the NSE year-to-date return\n\nWhile some stocks did not make the top 10 list, they have outperformed the NSE year-to-date return -5.9 percent. These stocks include McNichols (56.86%), Guinness (52.63%), Eterna (47%), WAPIC (42.5%) and Honeywell Flour Mill (39.17%).\n\nOutlook for H2\n\nOn the outlook for the second half of the year, investment analysts have projected that investors might flock back if companies post impressive half-year performance and for dividend benefits.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for equities in the second half is not very positive, the only catalyst for a slight rebound might be positive earnings by companies which could stimulate investors interest,\u201d an equity analyst who prefers anonymity says.\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital, a Lagos-based investment house, have also projected that investors might flock back to reap dividend benefits.\n\n\u201cDespite the yield retracement in the fixed income market, we do not think investors should give up on the possibility of a market rally in the second half of the year as we still see scope for positive market performance.\n\n\u201cGiven that the second half of the year is associated with the declaration of interim dividends, we envisage that investors will flock into stocks with attractive dividend yields as we inch closer to the half-year earnings season,\u201d they note.",

It\u2019s high time we redesigned a new one for optimal service delivery.\n\n\u201cWe must redesign our healthcare system. Healthcare has social and economic implications.

Whether that service is provided by a federal, state, or private hospital; it is my responsibility.\n\n\u201cSo, governance is key and technology is important.

Charles Akhigbe, at the stakeholders\u2019 sensitization meeting at the Government House, Benin City, said the port would improve economic activities in the state and create thousands of jobs for Edo people, as well as Nigerians.\n\nStakeholders at the meeting include Okomu Plc, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Rongtai Industry, ESIPO and Zanithcarex Int\u2019l Limited, among others.\n\nAccording to Akhigbe, \u201cThis is a sensitization meeting to bring all the potential port users in Edo State together under one room, to sensitize them about the AMES-Edo Inland Dry Port and the commencement of operations at the dry port because they are the ones to use the dry port and need to know the stage the dry port is and at what stage to come in and commence operation with us.\n\n\u201cIt will be a customs port, and a lot of activities at the Lagos Port will be done here at Edo State, yielding huge resources for the state and the federal government. This is the first phase and other phases will follow for bigger companies, medium-sized companies and small-scale businesses that are all over the state, to start thinking export.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cWe need to galvanise our people here in the state to take advantage of putting quality edible products together, as we are blessed with agricultural products in Edo, as the port will enable the exportation of quality, safe food products to Africa and the rest of the world directly from Edo State.\n\n\u201cA lot of Edo businessmen are going through hard times through the Lagos Port. But with the Dry Port, no need to go through the Lagos Port but the Edo Dry Port. We need to make sure that the potential port users are aware of the development.\u201d\n\nAkhigbe said AMES-Edo Dry Port was established to provide a one-stop cargo reception and clearance facility to boost exports from and imports into Edo State particularly, Nigeria\u2019s South-South, South-East and some states in the middle belt region, by by providing proper handling and logistics services.\n\n\u201cArrangements are ongoing with the relevant authority for a dedicated cargo airplane that will be able to carry a maximum of 60 tonnes using both the Edo and Delta State Airports.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government is facilitating the Ossiomo-Power to be connected to the Dry Port for 24/7 electricity supply to reduce cost and ensure that end-users and other stakeholders benefit.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "Group asks Nigerian farmers to protect crop biodiversity, boycott GMO seeds",
          "text": "The Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), an ecological think tank and advocacy organisation, has called on smallholder farmers to boycott continuous propagation of Genetically Modified Organisms(GMOs) in order to preserve and protect the country\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nThe organisation made the call in Abuja on Tuesday at a dialogue with medical practitioners on GMOs and the state of Biosafety in Nigeria.\n\nThe group stressed that the bedrock of biosafety is to take necessary precautions towards ensuring that indigenous crop species are not compromised, adding that the key to food safety and food sovereignty is food diversity preservation.\n\nHowever, they decried that adoption of genetically engineered crops will only streamline the country\u2019s food variety, with possible negative impact on human and environmental health.\n\nThe adoption of GMOs in Nigeria has always been a subject of debates.\n\nWhile some experts believe that the Nigerian farmers are yet to fully understand the efficacy of planting GM seeds, others argue that planting of GM seeds will help to produce enough food for the growing global population.\n\nSome analysts have posited that genetic engineering in agriculture ignored the fact of interdependence of species, which is greatly contributing to soil toxicity, destruction of several other crops, as well as beneficial soil microorganisms.\n\nWhat are GM crops?\n\nGenetically modified crops (commonly referred to as GM crops) are plants used in agriculture, whose DNA has been modified using genetic engineering methods.\n\nIn most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. Food crops for example can be genetically engineered to be resistant to certain pests, diseases, environmental conditions, reduction of spoilage, chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a herbicide), or just to improve the nutrient profile of the crop.\n\nGenetic modification can also be applied to non-food crops for the production of pharmaceutical agents, biofuels, and other industrially useful goods, as well as for bioremediation.\n\nMajor concerns\n\nIn his remarks, Nnimmo Bassey, HOMEF\u2019s country director, stated that smallholder farmers need to be fully integrated into the Nigerian farming system in order to achieve sustainable agriculture and food security.\n\nHe explained that this farming system (subsistence farming) helps to protect the three dimensions of sustainability which include the ecology, society and economy of people.\n\nTo achieve this, he said \u201cthere\u2019s a need to preserve the diversity of crops and varieties that provide the nutrition that we need for good health. This requires the protection of farmer-saved seeds and protection of varieties that local farmers have selected and developed over the centuries.\u201d\n\nMr Bassey lamented that there are over 3000 crops that can be cultivated in Africa, but that farmers have been pushed into cultivating just a few varieties which is at the detriment of the majority of people.\n\n\u201cToday we see increasing pressures for the adoption of genetically modified crops in Africa. These crops are mostly genetically engineered to withstand dangerous herbicides which kill other varieties except the engineered ones. The basic fact here is that the crops serve the interests of the chemical companies who concentrate their power of control over the sector and expose farmers and consumers to harm,\u201d Mr Bassey said.\n\nHe stated that other crops are genetically engineered to act as pesticides and kill identified pests that would otherwise attack the crop or seeds.\n\nExamples of such crops include Bt Cotton and Bt Cowpea or beans, he said, adding that the implication of eating a seed engineered to kill a pest is that you are eating a pesticide.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat we need in Nigeria is to support our local farmers. The local farmers do not feed Nigerians alone, they\u2019re the ones feeding the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe HOMEF official noted that responsible use of technology in agriculture requires that we keep careful watch on their effect on human and environmental health.\n\nAlso, he stated that there is a need to consider the fact that technologies that promote monoculture and erode our biodiversity are not sustainable and must be avoided in a world that is almost at the brink of ecological collapse.\n\nScourge\n\nWhile speaking on GMOs and their implications on human and environmental health, Ifeanyi Casmir, a molecular biologist at the university of Abuja, said genetically modified crops have been found to have implications on humans and environmental health.\n\nHe said they are body of evidences laying credence to the fact that some the genetic elements, such as Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fragments and Double- stranded Ribonucleic Acid(DsRNA) fragments that are used in GMOs modifications have been found in animal tissues, human blood, maternal blood, as well as in the blood of unborn children and that scientists do not have a comprehensive knowledge of the unintended outcomes that comes with this.\n\n\u201cIt is not the intention of those who are modifying crops that when you eat them, the DNA should escape cooking, escape digestion in the intestine and end up in the blood,\u201dhe said.\n\nMr Casmir explained that some of these traces have been linked to be causing hormonal disturbances,immune response disturbances, some forms of abnormalities in kidney and liver, and that ultimately it has been fingered to cause cancer in humans.\n\n\u201cThese are the worries we expressed as health professionals and health experts, and we are saying that these things are not healthier than what we have here in Nigeria,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the thought that GMOs can maximize yields of crops is half truth because a farmer is not concerned about the potential of a crop to yield, but that farmers are concerned about their actual yield, which is what they will take to the market.\n\nAfrican countries that have embraced GMOs\n\nAccording to a report published by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) in December last year, the numbers of countries in Africa that have adopted GM crop production doubled between 2018 and 2019.\n\nIt says Nigeria is among six African countries leading in GM crop adoption.\n\nThe ISAAA report noted that Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi, South Africa, Sudan and Swaziland are now the African countries where the planting of Genetically Modified (GM) crops thrives.\n\nAccording to the report, the aforementioned six countries grew three major biotech crops (maize, soybean and cotton) on approximately three million hectares by the end of 2019.\n\nIt says the seventh country, Kenya, granted approval for cultivation of Bt cotton and may soon join the league of adopter nations on the continent.\n\nRose Gidado, a deputy director at the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), who is also the country coordinator of the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) in Africa, had confirmed this to be true.\n\nShe said two crops were approved for commercialisation in 2018 and 2019 (Bt cotton and Bt Cowpea). In 2019, Bt cotton was planted in 12 states as demonstration plots on farmers fields, and in 2020, more states joined.\n\n\u201cFor Bt Cowpea, the year 2020 was a year of establishment of demonstration plots on farmers\u2019 fields to enhance their adoption of the crop based on evidence,\u201d she said.\n\nLegal justification\n\nNigeria endorsed the National Biosafety Management Act of 2015 that permitted the free flow of GMOs, giving room for the trial, commercial release and trans-border movement of these breeds in Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigerian Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), the agency saddled with the mandate to ensure proper regulation of modern biotechnology and its products so that it does not cause harm to human health and the environment, has been reported to have given Monsanto, a leading producers of genetically modified seeds, the permits to try and release GMO in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, some concerned Nigerians have called for a review of the signed National Biosafety Act of 2015.\n\nIfeanyi Nwankwere, a legal practitioner and Biosafety food advocate, said he feels Nigeria can do without GMOs and that we have all that it takes to handle food issues in the country.\n\nHe said the National Biosafety act of 2015 is highly defective and that it gives the NBMA so much powers to do and undo.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so many flaws we the current law, and we are saying that the law needs to be amended,\u201d he said. Adding that the consumption of organic foods is the sure path to thread by Nigerians.\n\nJoyce Brown, a programme manager at HOMEF believes that adoption of Agroecological practices is a viable alternative for Agricultural productivity and resilience.\n\nShe said increasing awareness among farmers about adopting agroecology instead of GMOs will help to boost healthy food production, encourage dryland restoration and as well help to mitigate climate change effects.",

          "title": "Amaechi Seeks Severe Punishment For Rail Vandals",
          "text": "Following an increase in the vandalism of railway facilities in the country,\n\nMinister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has recommended a charge of manslaughter for the perpetrators.\n\nHe disclosed this on Friday during the ministerial media briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the presidential villa.\n\nAccording to him, applying stringent laws will curb the habit, adding that the act can cause train derailment and killing of unsuspecting passengers.\n\nHe lamented that railway clips are frequently stolen, causing the country huge amounts of hard currency to replace.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThat\u2019s why I say to Nigerians that if I were to be a lawmaker, I\u2019ll be recommending manslaughter charge against those who engage in vandalisation of rail tracks.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that it takes about 800 metres for a locomotive to stop. As it\u2019s running now, it is running with speed. The moment it wants to stop, the driver will apply break here and it will take 800 metres to stop.\n\n\u201cSo, how will the driver know that you have removed or vandalised a track 800m away? He will not know until it gets to the track.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo, when it gets to the track, what happens? He applies break. But he needs 800m to stop. So, once it gets to that track that has been vandalised, he will derail. Once it derails, some people may die.\n\n\u201cEach coach takes 85 persons. And we are talking about 14, 20 coaches. You can imagine the number of people that will die as a result of that derailment.\n\n\u201cThis is just because one selfish Nigerian is trying to steal track to make money. I think like other countries, I\u2019m not saying that they should be killed because there\u2019s poverty. But I\u2019m saying they should be charged for mass manslaughter because people will die.\n\n\u201cBut again, they will tell you that manslaughter means that somebody died. If anybody dies, they should be charged for manslaughter. If nobody dies, they should be charged for stealing. That\u2019s my view.\n\n\u201cI say that because when they were stealing the narrow gauge, the one from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri, I wasn\u2019t worried. Whether we like it or not, we will replace it. That is the contract. But they move from stealing narrow gauge from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri to stealing narrow gauge from Lagos to Kano.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for possible company under Public Private Partnership (PPP) agreement that will take over that. If they take over, we will remove the old track and replace it with new ones.\n\n\u201cBut when they now move to Itakpe-Warri, which is now standard gauge, brand new tracks, then it becomes very dangerous. A poor man from Warri who is going to Itakpe by 6 o\u2019clock train does not know that his train will derail because somebody has cut off the track. That is dangerous.\n\nAnd I think that the solution is exactly what the government is doing now about insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe minister stressed the need to strictly apply the nation\u2019s laws as he said that such will make the citizens to behave well.\n\nHe said : \u201cYou see, I have always say that if you enforce the law, Nigerians will obey.\n\n\u201cNow, you are feeling a bit of security. Now, you can drive around and feel a bit secure more than before. It is because the government has said that this joke has to stop. The joke has started stopping. Is it not? That is what Nigerians like to hear. That is the way I governed Rivers State. When the person knows that there is law and as an elected governor, I will enforce the law.\n\n\u201cSo, if the law means to shoot my brother, I will shoot him. That is what the law says. Since you see the security agencies enforcing the law, everyone is now behaving well.\n\n\u201cSo, if we enforce the law on the vandalisation of tracks, it will stop. And I have asked the Managing Director of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRA) about their police. He said they were enough. I will meet the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to give us enough men and materials so that we can use them to police the tracks. Having moved from narrow gauge to standard gauge, it has become a national security issue because it\u2019s a daily movement, involving three, four, five, six trips a day..\u201d\n\nRegretting the cost of losing rail tracks to thieves, he said, \u201cThe only one I have made a decision are those stealing the clips. Like Kaduna-Abuja, over 6,000 to 10,000 clips have been stolen and have to be replaced daily so that we don\u2019t have a situation where the train derails. These clips are not made in Nigeria. They are bought overseas. So, we buy them in dollars.\n\n\u201cPart of solution is something called anti-theft clips. But they are more expensive. It is three times more expensive than the current one. But it\u2019s better. We are now replacing them with anti-theft clips in Lagos-Ibadan. All other constructions will now be anti-theft. With anti-theft, you can\u2019t open it. You can\u2019t remove it.\n\n\u201cBut we need to now go back to Abuja-Kaduna and change them to anti-theft clips. I don\u2019t know why we have not made that decision earlier because we have changed up to 10,000 to 15,000 clips in six years.\n\n\u201cI think the law should deal with those who break it. The law should not be quiet. I don\u2019t know what the law says. But a Chinese company arrested for buying those tracks got away with over N200,000 fine.\n\n\u201cThe law should give us much more than that. We got a Chinese company in Jos buying those from them. Few months later, we arrested a Chinese man in Nasarawa. That is the issue of vandals.\u201d\n\nThe minister also revealed that Nigeria and China have signed a contract to manufacture train coaches locally in the country following an initial five-year period of just the local assembling of the components.\n\nHe said an agreement has been signed for the Chinese to build a rail component manufacturing factory in Kajola, Ogun State due to be commissioned in 2021 and as well, a University in Daura, Katsina state to help localise railway technology.\n\nHe said 300 Nigerians have been sponsored to understudy rail technology in China and will be absorbed into the Transportation Ministry on completion of their studies.\n\nAmaechi also informed that the Kaduna-Kano railway project will be be flagged off in two weeks time just as he affirmed that that the Lekki Deep Sea Port will be completed before the end of the present administration.",

          "title": "Inside The World Of Nigeria\u2019s \u2018Teenage\u2019 TikTok Stars",
          "text": "By Solomon Elusoji\n\nNo, you don\u2019t have to be 19 or below to qualify as a teenage creator on TikTok. You just have to believe in two things: one, that humankind was made for joy; and two, that there is no limit, no rule to the expression of what the French call la gaiet\u00e9.\n\nBehind the roaring success of TikTok globally- the app now has about one billion monthly active users \u2013 are these teenage creators who, incidentally, are also the audience. They shoot and edit and publish a diverse range of video content, from dance routines to lipsyncing lyrics, comedy, motivational excerpts and even doling out technical information.\n\nAnd, since everyone on TikTok is a potential creator, anyone can go viral overnight. Like Khabane Lame, a 21-year-old factory worker in the northern Italian industrial town of Chivasso who lost his job and then, using TikTok\u2019s duet and stitch features, was catapulted to fame.\n\nMany young Nigerians have already jumped on the TikTok train. According to Statista, TikTok was the ninth most popular social media platform in Nigeria, just behind LinkedIn and Telegram, as of the third quarter of 2020. And the future, no doubt, is brighter.\n\nRodney Umeh, a student of the University of Abuja, started making videos on TikTok \u201cjust for the fun of it.\u201d\n\nAnd then his short productions, composed of a waist-twisting dance routine, suspenseful music, sharp transitions and short captions \u2013 started to go viral.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember how I learnt the waist routine,\u201d he told Channels Television, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been using it since my secondary school days. It was on TikTok that I used it for the first time online.\u201d\n\nHis videos have garnered over 10 million likes.\n\n\u201cMy long term plan for TikTok is basically to entertain as many people as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the feeling I get when one of my followers tells me that my videos make his or her day is enough for me. Every other thing is just vibes.\n\nPriscilla Isaac started creating sometime in 2019 and is already one of the biggest local stars. \u201cI love how you can confidently express yourself in 60 seconds via TikTok,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTikTok has given many people confidence and brought out so many talented individuals, and that\u2019s what I love about it.\u201d\n\nBut beyond posting videos of her dance challenges and romantic monologues, she has also found creative ways to monetise TikTok.\n\n\u201cI started taking TikTok seriously when it became the next big social media platform for business owners,\u201d she said. \u201cBelieve it or not, TikTok is the biggest marketing platform in the world. It is competing with Twitter.\n\n\u201cAs a TikTok creator, the app doesn\u2019t pay me directly, but I get paid via promotions and jobs I do for business owners, musicians and brand owners. And I have worked with so many brands, including DSTV.\u201d\n\nNo boundaries\n\nThere are large social media platforms designed to encourage users, as much as possible, to stay within their peculiar walls.\n\nNot TikTok.\n\nTikTokers can link their Instagram and YouTube pages on their profile pages with brand logos displayed. They can easily export videos to WhatsApp and Twitter.\n\nAnd, because of its unique production features, creators routinely shoot and edit videos within the TikTok ecosystem to share natively on other social media platforms.\n\nOne of such creators is Ope Keshinro, who has a keen talent for mimicking outlandish characters.\n\n\u201cIt started during the lockdown,\u201d she told Channels Television. \u201cEveryone was looking for distractions and something to keep mind and body together. If I wasn\u2019t watching a movie, I was on social media.\u201d\n\nOne sunny afternoon, she was scrolling on Twitter when she stumbled on a funny, viral video and thought to recreate it.\n\n\u201cAt that time I didn\u2019t even have a TikTok account, so I had to open one to use the voiceover and that\u2019s where it all started from,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, she shoots and edits all her videos on TikTok. And, while her TikTok audience is growing, her Twitter profile has even done better.\n\nTaking advantage\n\nWhile TikTok is minting new celebrities, established media stars and content creators are also flocking to the platform to get a piece of the viral pie.\n\nCelebrities like Olamide, Korede Bello, Mr Macaroni and Taooma already have substantial TikTok following.\n\nThe platform gives them another format to connect with their fanbase in a different way, and also bring more people into the fold.\n\nFor Ayodele Aguda (Mcshemcomedian), who has been creating comedy skits on Facebook and YouTube since the early 2010s, TikTok was a game-changer.\n\nHe joined in 2019 and started producing short versions of his comedy.\n\n\u201cIn two months, I had gained like two million followers,\u201d he told Channels Television. \u201cIn another six months, I was on like three million. And the content was receiving so much acceptance. So I just kept doing that.\u201d\n\nAs of this month, Ayodele\u2019s videos have been liked over 110 million times. And with more than four million followers, he is one of the most popular TikTok creators in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou can easily go viral on TikTok,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cannot really happen on Instagram. On Instagram, someone has to take up your content. But on TikTok, it will likely go viral.\n\n\u201cIf somebody wants to start creating and they don\u2019t know where to start from, I tell them to start from TikTok.\n\n\u201cTikTok is where you are doing something other people are doing and no one will hold you that you are copying. Just take a sound and use it; and if you interpret it better than the person, it will go viral and people will follow you.\u201d\n\nThick skin\n\nDespite its feel-good ambience, like most of the social Internet, TikTok isn\u2019t immune to online abuse and bullying.\n\n\u201cI think the most unexpected comment I have gotten was my first hate comment,\u201d Rodney said. \u201cIt was unexpected at that time cause I was used to the positive comments.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Priscilla expects some negativity whenever she posts a piece of content.\n\n\u201cAs a content creator, we are already aware of people\u2019s bad energy and negative comments,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see them as normal.\n\n\u201cIt was when I first joined TikTok, I was literally afraid of getting bad comments, but no matter the type of content you post, not everyone will agree to it.\u201d\n\nAyodele agreed.\n\n\u201cNow I realise why politicians are not moved by what people say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve read so many comments, good and bad. And I\u2019ve realised that not everyone can be pleased.\u201d\n\nLast May, TikTok said it was launching new tools to combat bullying.\n\n\u201cPeople put their hearts and souls into creating and entertaining on TikTok, and we recognize how discouraging it can feel to receive unkind comments on videos,\u201d TikTok\u2019s Joshua Goodman said. \u201cWe hope this update helps creators feel more empowered over their experience on TikTok.\u201d\n\nFollow the money\n\nIn June, black American TikTok creators went on strike over not being credited and not receiving equal rewards for their creativity.\n\nThere was no evidence that Nigerian TikTokers participated in the action or were even aware, but many complained about not being able to earn directly from their TikTok work.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of plans for TikTok, but it\u2019s not on the agenda now because they don\u2019t pay yet,\u201d Ayodele said.\n\nHe\u2019d rather focus on investing more resources in social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube who pay Nigerian creators.\n\nTikTok has a rolling fund for creators, but it is only available for those based in the US, UK, France, Germany, Spain or Italy.\n\n\u201cTikTok should start appreciating content creators like me,\u201d Priscilla said. \u201cThe app should start paying African creators and if they do so, this is going to be a great thing for us creators.\u201d\n\nFor now, Nigerian super creators rely on third party sponsorships to keep the burgeoning flame alive.\n\n\u2018Tik Tok Won\u2019t Wait\u2019\n\nMost TikTok videos do not require any fancy production equipment, even for stars; although some go heavy once they can afford it.\n\nTo be successful on TikTok, you only need to \u201ckeep it natural and be consistent,\u201d according to Priscilla.\n\n\u201cYou just have to keep creating,\u201d Ayodele offered. \u201cAnd be putting out content. Don\u2019t put anything in your archive and feel it\u2019s not good. Let people tell you whether it is good or not. In fact, people can criticise your content so much and it helps people know you.\u201d\n\nAnd for Ope Keshinro, the star who has equally gained traction on Twitter through her TikTok production, creators shouldn\u2019t wait for the perfect location. \u201cShoot any and everywhere you can. Tiktok won\u2019t wait for you,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery week, new challenges are launched so if you wait to get a fine background you just might miss out lol . . . unless it\u2019s fashion and beauty you\u2019re focused on then that\u2019s understandable because of aesthetics and all. If it\u2019s comedy or any other thing you\u2019re doing, do it fast.\n\n\u201cAlso be creative, think about what makes your own content stand out. Hundreds of creators have most likely done the content you want to do, so think about what would make your own different; it can be your choice of costume, your mannerism or your transitions.\u201d\n\nAnd, very importantly, she added, focus on your lighting.\n\n\u201cYou need to have the perfect lighting,\u201d she said. \u201cRinglights don\u2019t even suffice anymore so you need to find the perfect lighting else the quality of the video comes out poor. The people abroad don\u2019t have this kind of issue, maybe because their sky is brighter? But you\u2019ll hardly see any video with poor quality from a creator overseas.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nDespite its widespread success, TikTok\u2019s future is not cast in stone.\n\nOwned by Chinese company Bytedance, the app has had its troubles with governments across the world. It was almost suspended in the United States during the administration of Donald Trump and the app is banned in Pakistan for promoting \u2018indecent\u2019 content.\n\nIn Nigeria, it has largely escaped attention as the country tightens control on social media amid an indefinite suspension of Twitter.\n\nAnd, government regulation may be an advantage for TikTok. Chinese tech companies have a reputation for sticking to government rules.\n\nBesides, TikTok\u2019s official mission is not freedom or political emancipation, but to \u201cinspire creativity and bring joy.\u201d And, who doesn\u2019t love a good laugh?",

          "text": "Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has challenged the Federal Government to also arrest members of armed Fulani groups for carrying out attacks on farming communities in parts of the country.\n\nOrtom said such a move is imperative even as the country\u2019s food sufficiency policy is currently being threatened by the willful killings across the nation.\n\nGovernor Ortom who made the call in Makurdi, during the flag-off of the 2021 subsidized fertilizer sale at 50% per NPK 50kg bag from the initial twelve thousand Naira to Six thousand Naira, said he has no problem with the arrest of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, but the fight against terrorism and other crimes would only be seen to be unbiased if armed herders who have been killing innocent citizens are also apprehended.\n\nWhile quoting President Muhammadu Buhari as admitted recently that herdsmen occupying the forests and terrorizing the people are not Nigerians, Ortom wondered why no effort has been made to bring these herders to justice when the very citizens the president pledged to defend are now victims and IDPs in their own country.\n\nOrtom\u2019s comments come a day after Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State stated that it is not enough for the Federal Government to arrest Nnamdi Kanu, while leaders of other notorious groups are roaming wild and free.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018How Will Nigerians Feel?\u2019 Wike Rules Out Defecting To APC\n\nKanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB), was rearrested, brought back to Nigeria, and re-arraigned on Tuesday, June 29.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Governor Wike said for justice to be said to have prevailed, the Federal Government must ensure that the leaders of other groups that have been linked to killings and unrest must be arrested and made to face the law.\n\nWike who on Thursday was a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, said in the case of Kanu, due process must be followed so that justice may come full circle.\n\n\u201cI have said as governor of Rivers State, I do not believe in Kanu\u2019s principles or the way he wants to actualize Biafra. I have said that Rivers State is not part of Biafra.\n\n\u201cHowever, having arrested him, the due process of the law must follow. You cannot just say that because you have arrested him therefore you will not allow justice to prevail. You must follow the due process of law.\n\n\u201cAnd again, do not do it as if all our target is against a certain section of the country because it is not only Nnamdi Kanu we are talking about as regards insecurity in the country. We have bandits, we have Miyetti Allah who have caused a lot of problems, so government must endeavour to go after the heads of these organizations and associations and arrest them and bring them to book,\u201d Wike stated.\n\nThe governor was of the opinion that if the government toes his advice, then Nigerians will be able to say that of a truth, justice has been done.\n\nHe added that a failure to see that the other arrests are made will only suggest that the move is targetted at just one section of the country, a situation which Wike says will breed issues over injustice and debates regarding marginalization.",

          "title": "Full Throttle: England Boss Southgate Says No Rotation in Euro Quarterfinal with Ukraine",
          "text": "Gareth Southgate said it would be \u201can insult to Ukraine\u201d for England to rotate their lineup due to the possibility of four players missing a potential Euro 2020 semifinal.\n\nPhil Foden, Harry Maguire, Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips would all be ruled out of a last-four encounter against either the Czech Republic or Denmark if they picked up another booking when the Three Lions meet Ukraine in Saturday\u2019s quarterfinal at Rome\u2019s Olympic Stadium.\n\nEngland are favourites to progress to the final as the highest rank team left in their half of the draw, while they have lost just one of their seven meetings with Ukraine, winning the only previous Euros clash 1-0 in 2012.\n\nHowever, asked by ESPN whether the yellow card situation would affect his team selection against Andriy Shevchenko\u2019s side, Southgate replied:\n\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t really understand that rationale. I understand that strategically you might like to do that but I can\u2019t think of a country in the world that would do that for a quarterfinal.\n\n\u201cAnd especially not a country that has only been to three semifinals in its history. No, I think we\u2019ve got to focus on tomorrow. I think it would be a big error for us to be thinking about anything else and I think it would be an insult to Ukraine as well.\n\n\u201cSo, we won\u2019t make any decisions based on yellow cards. We did in the last group game because we knew we had qualified and we had the opportunity to protect Phil within that game because we weren\u2019t sure what was going to happen further on. But now we play to win and we have got to have everybody available.\u201d\n\nThe game kicks off at 9 p.m. local time, but temperatures in the Italian capital are still expected to reach 25-degrees-Celsius.\n\nEngland have habitually struggled to cope with such conditions given their lack of exposure to warmer climes during the domestic season, but Southgate is drawing confidence from their Group D opening win over Croatia at Wembley.\n\nTemperatures in that afternoon match when reached a yearly high in the United Kingdom of 28-degrees-Celsius.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be as hot as the game with Croatia and of course the sun will be going down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be playing in the evening which will give some respite I think. I think we are definitely used to handling those sorts of conditions. It will be important to use the ball well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for certain and we\u2019ve got all the sort of cooling strategies and rehydration strategies that any team would have really.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Southgate added that Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka faces a late fitness test after picking up a knock in training on Friday.",

          "text": "Countries across Europe are scrambling to accelerate coronavirus vaccinations and outpace the spread of the more infectious delta variant, in a high-stakes race to prevent hospital wards from filling up again with patients fighting for their lives.\n\nThe urgency coincides with Europe\u2019s summer holiday months, with fair weather bringing more social gatherings and governments reluctant to clamp down on them. Social distancing is commonly neglected, especially among the young, and some countries are scrapping the requirement to wear masks outdoors.\n\nIncentives for people to get shots include free groceries, travel and entertainment vouchers, and prize drawings. The president of Cyprus even appealed to a sense of patriotism.\n\nThe risk of infection from the delta variant is \u201chigh to very high\u201d for partially or unvaccinated communities, according to the European Centre for Disease Control, which monitors 30 countries on the continent. It estimates that by the end of August, the variant will account for 90% of cases in the European Union.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to progress with the vaccine rollout at a very high pace,\u201d the ECDC warned.\n\nThe World Health Organization is also concerned. The variant makes transmission growth \u201cexponential,\u201d according to Maria Van Kerkhove, its technical lead on COVID-19.\n\nDaily new case numbers are already climbing sharply in countries like the United Kingdom, Portugal and Russia.\n\nIn the U.K., cases of the delta variant have increased fourfold in less than a month, with confirmed cases Friday up 46% on the previous week.\n\nPortuguese health authorities this week reported a \u201cvertiginous\u201d rise in the prevalence of the delta variant, which accounted for only 4% of cases in May but almost 56% in June. The country is reporting its highest number of daily cases since February, and the number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals has surpassed 500 for the first time since early April.\n\nReports of new infections in Russia more than doubled in June, topping 20,000 per day this week, and deaths hit 679 on Friday, the fourth day in a row that the death toll set a daily record.\n\nStill, \u201cno one wants any lockdowns,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov at a briefing, although he admitted that the virus situation in a number of Russian regions is \u201ctense.\u201d\n\nIn some countries, the virus is spreading much faster among younger people. In Spain, the national 14-day case notification rate per 100,000 people rose to 152 on Friday. But for the 20-29 age group, it shot up to 449.\n\nThose numbers have triggered alarm across the continent.\n\nThe Dutch government is extending its vaccination program to those aged 12-17 to help head off a feared new surge. Greece is offering young adults 150 euros ($177) in credit after their first jab. Rome authorities are mulling the use of vans to vaccinate people at the beach. And Poland last week launched a lottery open only to adults who are fully vaccinated, with new cars among the prizes.\n\nPortuguese authorities have extended the hours of vaccination centers, created new walk-in clinics, called up armed forces personnel to help run operations, and reduced the period between taking the two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from 12 weeks to eight weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against the clock,\u201d Cabinet Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said.\n\nIn the fight against vaccine hesitancy across Europe, the appearance of variants has fed public uncertainty about how effective the shots are.\n\nIn Madrid this week, Claudia Aguilar, a 58-year-old archaeologist, got her second Pfizer-BioNTech jab at an auditorium that is expanding its working hours overnight.\n\nNevertheless, she said she is \u201cnot sure I\u2019ll really be immune\u201d against future variants.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m a bit skeptical that this is going to do any good,\u201d Aguilar said.\n\nBartender Yevgeniya Chernyshkova was lined up Thursday for a shot at Moscow\u2019s GUM department store just off Red Square after the government required vaccinations for workers in some sectors.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s becoming mandatory and we all understand why \u2014 because the third wave of the pandemic has started here,\u201d she said.\n\nFifteen months after WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, some governments appear more minded to reward public patience while thinking twice about bringing back restrictions.\n\nSome 40,000 fans went to England\u2019s European Championship soccer match against Germany at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium last week. In Portugal, new restrictions have been half-hearted, such as limiting restaurant opening hours on weekend nights.\n\nIn Moscow, however, restaurants, bars and cafes on Monday began admitting only customers who have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months or can provide a negative test in the previous 72 hours.\n\nFrance lifted the last of its major restrictions Wednesday, allowing unlimited crowds in restaurants, at weddings and most cultural events despite fast-rising cases of the delta variant.\n\nTiago Correia, an associate professor at Lisbon\u2019s Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, detects a mood of public impatience, especially among young people keen to enjoy warm summer nights.\n\n\u201cPeople want to return to normal more quickly than the vaccination rollout is happening,\u201d he said.\n\nThe emerging variants have shone a light on the unprecedented scale of the immunization programs. The ECDC says that in the countries it surveys, 61% of people over 18 have had one shot and 40% are completely vaccinated.\n\nBut Dr. Hans Kluge, the head of the WHO\u2019s Europe office, cautioned this week that the delta variant is poised to become dominant by August in the 53-country region his office covers. And he notes that some 63% of people in that region haven\u2019t had a first jab.\n\n\u201cThe three conditions for a new wave of excess hospitalizations and deaths before the (fall) are therefore in place: New variants, deficit in vaccine uptake, increased social mixing,\u201d Kluge said.",

          "text": "Seventeen governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states will on Monday converge on Lagos for the second time this year to continue their search for solution to the myriad of problems confronting the country.\n\nAt the last meeting, hosted by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and attended by 15 of the 17 southern governors, they arrived at a 12-point resolution, which included the banning of open grazing in all the states.\n\nSources said the meeting on Monday in Lagos would examine the progress made regarding the Asaba Declaration, examine oppositions to some of the demands and come up with a better strategy for actualising the demands.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe governors are working towards a better Southern Nigeria within the Nigerian nation. This meeting is in continuation of that agenda. It is a continuation of the meeting held in Asaba. The southern governors will be looking at the gains of the last meeting and come up with their next move.\n\n\u201cYou know the southern governors agreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken towards the restructuring of the Nigerian federation leading to the devolution of power. They want inclusive government at the federal level, state police, a review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments, and creation of some other institutions, which will legitimately advance commitment to the practice of true federalism. Strategies are needed to actualise all these. This is why they are meeting again in Lagos.\u201d\n\nAnother source close to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is chief host, said in the spirit of Lagos hospitality, the Lagos governor has promised to provide a conducive environment for the 17 governors to brainstorm properly.\n\nDuring the first meeting in Asaba, the southern governors resolved to ban all forms of open grazing in the southern states of the country.\n\nAlthough, the governors came short of calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to reshuffle heads of top agencies to reflect federal character against the backdrop of the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nature of Nigeria, they urged the President to ensure that the sensibilities of the people were respected and reflected in federal appointments.\n\nWhile affirming the commitment of the peoples of Southern Nigeria to \u201cthe unity of the country on the basis of fairness, equity and oneness,\u201d the governors expressed grave concern about the security challenge plaguing the country and charged the President to act decisively to address the situation.\n\nSpecifically, the governors of the southern states called on President Buhari to convoke a national conference to address the insecurity and other challenges in order to restore the confidence of the citizens in the Nigerian geo-political entity.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said that the southern governors \u201cobserved that incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security.\u201d\n\nBut the federal government responded, saying the southern governors\u2019 proposed plan to enforce the ban on open grazing \u201cis of questionable legality.\u201d\n\nSegun James",

          "text": "Four million doses of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine from the US are heading to Indonesia, the US national security adviser has informed the Indonesian foreign minister, as the country battles record coronavirus infections and deaths that forced an emergency lockdown starting on Saturday.\n\nIn a call with Retno Marsudi on Friday, Jake Sullivan said the doses would be shipped via the COVAX global vaccine sharing programme \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d a White House statement said.\n\nSullivan said the donation \u201cunderscored the United States\u2019 support for the people of Indonesia as they fight a surge in COVID-19 cases\u201d.\n\nThe two officials also discussed US plans to increase assistance for Indonesia\u2019s broader COVID-19 response efforts, the statement said.\n\n\u201cSullivan highlighted the importance the Biden-Harris administration places on Indonesia, Southeast Asia and ending the pandemic more broadly and pledged continued support and high-level engagement,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIndonesia is the world\u2019s fourth-most populous country and has been battling one of Asia\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nThe nation has recorded record new infections on eight of the past 12 days, including 25,830 new cases on Friday, and a record 539 deaths.\n\nIn Jakarta province alone, Governor Anies Baswedan said in a press conference on Friday that active cases have already reached 78,000 from 27,000 in February.\n\nAnies said that if the trend continues, the active cases could hit 100,000 in a few days.\n\nSince the pandemic last year, Indonesia has reported a total of 2,228,938 cases and 59,534 deaths.\n\nThe surge in new cases and deaths has prompted President Joko Widodo to declare emergency restrictions on movement starting on Saturday in the island of Java and Bali. The lockdown is effective until July 20.\n\nPenny K Lukito, the chief of Indonesia\u2019s food and drug agency, said earlier on Friday it authorised the Moderna vaccine for emergency use.\n\nMeanwhile, the country\u2019s health minister also announced on Friday that Indonesia is planning to vaccinate under-18s with the coronavirus mRNA shot jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.\n\nBudi Gunadi Sadikin said the island of Java, home to about half of the country\u2019s more than 270 million people, was where most outbreaks with the highly transmissible Delta variant of COVID-19 occurred. The variant was first identified in India.\n\n\u201cShe was healthy, her pregnancy was normal, and suddenly she\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is seen as 84 percent effective, even with the Delta variant, after two doses, but only 34 percent effective with only one dose, according to a report by the US website NBC Boston.\n\nModerna also announced on Tuesday that its vaccine showed promise against the Delta variant, based on a study conducted on blood serum from eight participants obtained one week after they received the second dose of the vaccine.\n\nThe company said the vaccine was far more effective in producing antibodies against the Delta variant than it was against the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.\n\nIndonesia has relied mainly on the vaccine from China\u2019s Sinovac, but has been looking to diversify supply sources.\n\nWashington has been competing with Beijing to deepen geopolitical clout through so-called vaccine diplomacy, although it has said it is not sharing vaccines to secure favours or extract concessions, but to save lives and end the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden administration pledged last month to share an initial 80 million US-made vaccines globally amid concern about the disparity in vaccination rates between advanced and developing countries.\n\nIt has already announced plans to provide vaccines to other Southeast Asian countries \u2013 the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, and Cambodia.\n\nIt has also said it will buy 500 million Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to distribute to the African Union and 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries.",
