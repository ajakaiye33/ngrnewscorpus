          "title": "IPOB threatens fresh sit-at-home, banks, others shut despite suspension",
          "text": "DESPITE the suspension of the sit-at-home order in the South-East by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, activities were grounded in some parts of the region.\n\nThis was as the IPOB made a U-turn and threatened to recommence the \u2018every Monday\u2019 sit-at-home protest starting from August 23.\n\nBanks, schools, shops and other businesses did not open for work in many parts of Abia, Ebonyi, Imo and Anambra states, while traders and other business concerns opened in Enugu State.\n\nThough one of the reasons for the absence of normal activities in four out of the five southeastern states was that many were not aware of the suspension of the sit-at-home order, others genuinely closed shops in solidarity with the IPOB leader.\n\nIn Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, commercial banks and other businesses remained shut as the sit-at-home order was observed irrespective of the suspension of the directive.\n\nOne of our correspondents, who monitored the situation, gathered that banks, motor parks, filling stations, eateries, major shops and supermarkets remained closed in the state capital.\n\nAlso affected were shops at the Abakaliki International market and Ophoke-Abba market in Kpiri-Kpiri, where shop owners shut down businesses.\n\nThe PUNCH further reports that major roads, including the Abakaliki/Enugu; Abakaliki/Afikpo highways and other major busy internal roads like Afikpo and Ogoja roads were scanty with human and vehicular movements.\n\nA trader, Mr Simon Ngaji at Ophoke-Abba Market, Kpiri-Kpiri explained that people, especially shop owners in the market did not receive the news of the suspension, while some doubted its authenticity.\n\nUmuahia quiet, total at Aba\n\nIn Umuahia, the Abia State capital, there was no visible movement of security operatives, as schools were closed, except for those conducting NECO and WASC examinations.\n\nIn Aba, a middle-aged man was shot dead at Gas Line by Express.\n\nThis was confirmed in a statement by the Coalition of South-East Youth Leader.\n\nThe coalition condemned \u201cthe gruesome killing of an unarmed innocent youth at Gas Line by Nigerian soldiers\u201d.\n\nIn the statement by Goodluck Ibem, the President General and Kanice Igwe, the Secretary General, the body further stated, \u201cWe call on Nigeria authorities to order a prompt, independent and impartial inquiry into the killing by the army, identify suspected perpetrators and ensure that they are brought to justice without delay.\u201d\n\nBanks, others closed in Imo\n\nSimilarly, banks, business centres, eateries failed to open on Monday in Owerri, the Imo state capital, despite the cancellation of the weekly sit-at home order by IPOB.\n\nThe PUNCH monitored activities on Monday morning in the state capital and observed that streets and roads were deserted.\n\nFew persons, who came out, found it difficult to get vehicles that could convey them to their destinations.\n\nMajor markets like Nkwo-Orji, Alana international market, Ekeukwu Owerri, Amakaohia and Akwakuma markets were almost empty.\n\nThe ever busy Imo State University Roundabout, Government House Roundabout, Cherubim junction, Control Post Roundabout, Warehouse Roundabout, Emmanuel College Roundabout and Fire service Roundabout all in Owerri were also deserted.\n\nAlso, Owerri to Orlu, Onitsha, Port Harcourt, Okigwe, Mbaise and Aba roads were all deserted by motorists and passersby, while with shops and motor parks were closed.\n\nAn artisan, who spoke with The PUNCH, said, \u201cI am not going anywhere; I will stay at home today because my life is more important to me. They may be telling us that the sit-at-home order has been cancelled so that we will come out and be harmed. One day with my family will not kill me.\u201d\n\nNothing changed in Anambra despite the suspension of the exercise, as socio-economic activities were grounded in Awka, Onitsha, Nnewi and other major towns in the state.\n\nOne of our correspondents, who monitored the situation in the state, observed that banks, markets, shops, government establishments and other businesses were shut down.\n\nA resident, who gave his name as Okechukwu Madu, said, \u201cI heard on the Radio Biafra that there was nothing like suspension of the sit-at-home. We want the exercise to continue till Kanu is released.\u201d\n\nNormal activities in Enugu after suspension\n\nHowever, economic and social activities went on in all parts of the Enugu State following the cancellation of the sit-at-home order.\n\nIt was observed that streets and roads returned back to life after the sit-at-home order were obeyed last Monday, August 9, as roads and streets witnessed gradual human and vehicular movement.\n\nAlthough the movement was scanty, workers went to work, even as banks, malls, shops, markets, filling stations, motor parks, schools, business centres, offices that shut down last Monday, were all opened for business.\n\nIPOB makes U-turn, threatens fresh protest\n\nIn a related development, the IPOB has threatened to recommence the \u2018every Monday\u2019 sit-at-home protest, starting from August 23.\n\nThe group had suspended the weekly protest meant to prevail on the Federal Government to release their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who is in detention over allegations bordering on treasonable felony.\n\nIPOB, while suspending the protest last week, said the exercise would only hold on the days Kanu would appear in court.\n\nBut the Media and Publicity Secretary of the secessionist group, Emma Powerful, said group might recommence the exercise, starting from next Monday.\n\nHe said, \u201cIPOB is no longer forcing anyone to stay at home, but our people are voluntarily doing so to show how they feel and value our leader. That will make us to continue with the exercise from next week.\n\n\u201cIf we begin again, even an ant will not be allowed to be seen on any road or street in Biafra land in any of the protest days, unless that idiot (defaulter) has written his or her will.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Thirteen more suspects have been arrested by the police in connection with the killing of over 22 persons in Jos, Plateau State, by suspected Irigwe militia on Saturday, bringing the total number of suspects in custody to 33.\n\nThis is just as a coalition of 52 Northern Groups warned that it would not tolerate any further attack on highways in the northern region.\n\nThe organisation also demanded investigation and prosecution of the persons behind the killing.\n\nAlso, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, deployed additional operational assets, including a helicopter, two units of Police Mobile Force and two cells of Counter-Terrorism Unit in the state.\n\nThe surveillance helicopter is expected to provide support to the ground troops carrying out coordinated operations in the hotspots.\n\nThe force spokesman, Frank Mba, said this in statement on Monday titled, \u2018Plateau attacks: IGP deploys surveillance helicopter, says police committed to restoring order.\u2019\n\nIt reads partly, \u201cThe Inspector -General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered the deployment of additional operational assets including a police surveillance helicopter, two units of Police Mobile Force and two cells of Counter-Terrorism Unit to Plateau State.\n\n\u201cThe IGP noted that 13 additional suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident, bringing the total number of arrested persons to 33. He assured that the NPF is committed to working with other patriotic stakeholders toward restoring public order in Plateau and other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nMba added that the Head of the Police Intervention Team, DIG Sanusi Lemu, was already on the ground in Plateau, \u201ccoordinating the investigative, operational and peace-building response.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesman for the Coalition of 52 Northern Groups, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, in Abuja on Monday also cautioned political and religious leaders against making unguarded statements that could instigate unnecessary reprisals.\n\nAccording to him, the CNG had taken stock of the incessant attacks and \u201cunrelenting deadly highway ambushes and cold blood massacre of innocent Nigerians travelling through most Plateau State communities and major highways.\u201d\n\nThe CNG spokesperson said matters had \u201creached a point where silence has become complicity and inaction no longer an option.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe demand a thorough investigation, arrest and diligent prosecution of the criminals that block and kill innocent travellers on such public highways as the Rukuba junction in Gada biyu, Abuja and Barikin Ladi Roads in Plateau State and other locations in Kaduna and Benue states.\n\n\u201cWe demand action from the Federal Government to ensure a permanent end to the incessant highway attacks, including the arrest of traditional rulers and all elected representatives from the communities that harbour the terrorists, and where resistance is shown, the communities be demolished and replaced by military posts.\n\n\u201cWe demand the promulgation of special penal laws for the punishment of such offences that involve the ambush and killings of innocent public highway users.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re working to stop killings\u2019\n\nAlso, the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, on Monday said his administration was working to stop the killings.\n\nHe spoke on Monday after visiting some areas affected by the violence, as well as the Bingham University Teaching Hospital and the Plateau State Specialists, where some of the injured victims were receiving treatment.\n\nThe governor insisted that his administration had done a lot to address insecurity in the state.\n\nLalong said, \u201cSince the first one that happened in Bassa to this time, we have arrested people and I have asked that all those people should be prosecuted. We will go after others because we don\u2019t want to allow this kind of thing again to come back to the people of Plateau State. The people of Plateau State have been living in peace for a while now.\n\n\u201cI want to assure the people of Plateau State that they should not be sacred. People should stop sending wrong messages.\u201d\n\nThe governor maintained that the curfew earlier imposed on the three local government areas would remain \u201cwhile we monitor the situation.\u201d\n\nMore killings on Monday\n\nMeanwhile, the governor was still at the Plateau State Specialist Hospital when a man, Peter Ibrahim, brought a corpse, saying he was killed in Congo Russia community in Jos North LGA.\n\nIbrahim told journalists that the victim was the third he had brought to the hospital on Monday alone saying that silent killings were still going on in the community.\n\nHe urged the government to stop the killings in the area.\n\nOne of our correspondents also gathered that a young man was shot dead in Dong community, in Jos North LGA on Monday.\n\nA resident, Silas Nuhu, said, \u201cSome group of herdsmen were grazing in the area and some youths tried to stop them from grazing on crops. But they started shooting and killed the young man.\n\nThe Military Information Officer of the Operation Safe Haven, Major Ishaku Takwa, said that none of the incidents had been reported to the taskforce.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

These call for caution and proactive actions, which should take into consideration, in the main, the review of the mode of teaching and learning in the second semester and, as a consequence, provide a safe way to undertake pedagogical activities on Nigerian university campuses.\n\n\u201cWith the daily rising cases of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and with several cases within the main campus and the College of Medicine/UCH campuses, the ERTC considered a proposal of blended teaching for the second-semester in the university.\n\n\u201cThe blended learning model should be officially decided in terms, either of availability of sections of the student population for online or physical encounters or the categorization of courses as online or physical.\n\n\u201dThis neutralizes the choice of location or keeps all students, in principle, in physical presence within and/or around the campus,\u201d she said.\n\nFaluyi said the proposed platforms and tools to be used, according to the ERTC, include: LMS, Zoom, YouTube Gsuite accounts, Telegram fora, Solution clinics, which should be maintained for use by students and staff in all cases.\n\n\u201cGoogle meet, which is practically free, should, in addition, be encouraged for lectures, since all academics have access to Gmail accounts.\n\n\u201cFirm decisions and systematicity should be applied on the preference for the operations of blended learning to ensure effectiveness,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that the management had decried the poor compliance with COVID-19 protocols by the entire university community and emphasised the need to ensure strict compliance through the university\u2019s COVID-19 Committee.\n\n\u201cIf the situation worsens on campus, full online engagement should be mounted for all courses as was done in the first semester, exempting only departments and units with special needs, on the condition that evident strict compliance with the protocols will be observed.\n\n\u201cBigger Zoom rooms for courses, with more than 1,800 students, should be purchased and added to the existing pool\u201d, Faluyi added.\n\nThe registrar enjoined everyone to take personal responsibility for his/her safety by obeying all COVID-19 safety protocols.\n\n\u201cIf we do this, there will be no cause for panic on our campus,\u201d she said.\n\nFaluyi also disclosed that arrangements were ongoing to make vaccines available for all staff and students, as soon as possible, the details of which would be provided as more progress is made, she said.",

          "text": "Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has re-echoed the call for a new Nigerian constitution, which will evolve from the will of the people and not foisted on Nigerians like the present 1999 Constitution.\n\nIkpeazu posited that the new Constitution will restructure the country and devolve more powers to the federating units, entrench resource control by the states, establish federal, state, and local government police formations and be more responsive to the protection of the rights of all citizens, as well as provide a level playing field where all Nigerians will be treated equally.\n\nThe Abia Governor made these calls today as Keynote Speaker at the 5th Osasu Show Symposium with the theme, \u201cState of the nation, the Peoples Constitution\u201d held at the International Conference Centre in Abuja.\n\nIt was contained in a release issued to journalists in Umuahia, the state capital by Onyebuchi Ememanka, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ikpeazu on Monday.\n\nIkpeazu stated that the major fundamental flaw of the present constitution is that it lacks the ownership of the people which is a key ingredient that clothes Constitutions with the requisite legitimacy.\n\nWhile elucidating on the sources of a Constitution, the Abia Chief Executive noted that the road to a proper constitution involves processes through which the voice and views of the people can be found.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthese could be through constitutional conferences, referenda, Acts of parliament, Judicial precedents, customs of the people, conventions, etc. Drawing inference from constitutions of other countries like the USA, Argentina, South Africa, Tanzania, etc\u201d.\n\nThe Governor added what Nigeria currently has is a constitution handed down by military fiat complete with all the nuances of totalitarianism with a very powerful President, Governors and even Local Government Chairmen across the country.\n\nThis military mindset, the Governor further opined, was the reason for unduly concentrating powers in the federal government in areas where it ordinarily has no business with.\n\nHe said, \u201cthis needless concentration of powers in the federal government especially in the areas of security, revenue generation and allocation, resource control has stifled growth in the states and local governments, making them \u201cparasitic appendages of a powerful federal government\u201d.\n\n\u201cA situation where states look forward to monthly receipts from Abuja has killed hard-work and initiatives, recalling the first Republic when the regions thrived well when they were quasi independent\u201d.\n\nOn Security, Governor Ikpeazu decried a situation where a State Governor in Nigeria cannot take actions to manage an urgent security issue because by virtue of the proviso to Section 215 (4) of the Constitution, the Commissioner of Police in a state may request that a matter be referred to the President or minister.\n\nAccording to him, the existence of a single national police outfit is at variance with the federal system of government and this has led to the establishment by different states in the country of vigilante outfits and other forms of security and traffic management teams.\n\nOn resource control, he decried a situation where some office of the Federal Government in Abuja hands out licenses to people to exploit mineral resources in states without any recourse to the states and even the local communities where these sites are located, and after these activities, these communities are abandoned with grave environmental problems.\n\nThe Governor also faulted the provisions of the present constitution for failing to provide proper qualification for leadership in Nigeria.\n\nHe wondered why a modern constitution in a modern time like this when science and technology is the order of the day, would prescribe a School Certificate as the qualification for the office of the President of Nigeria.\n\nOur present constitution, Ikpeazu noted, is not autochthonous and as such is incapable of commanding the requisite quantum of social mobilizarion required to move forward, a multi ethnic, multi religious, multi lingual and multi cultural country like Nigeria.\n\nIkpeazu suggested that young Nigerians of between the ages of 20 and 35 be invited from both the Diaspora and locally, drawn across different professions \u2013 engineering, law, security, arts, education, architecture, economics, artisanship, etc to sit down and craft a new vision for our country.\n\n\u201cTheir inputs can be inculcated into our new efforts towards a people\u2019s constitution, \u201che concluded.\n\nAccording to the release by Ememanka, \u201cthe event attracted an array of dignitaries. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo joined virtually while the Acting Canadian High Commissioner, Ambassador Nicolas Simmard delivered the opening address.\n\n\u201cFormer Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bello Adoke was also a speaker at the event which also featured panel discussions.\n\n\u201cThe 2-day event continues tomorrow\u201d.",

They were scared that he could just disappear into the thin air because of his mystical powers.\n\n\u201cThe police told me that if Igboho\u2019s chains were untied and he escapes mysteriously, he (police officer) will be stripped of his rank and also dismissed.\n\n\u201cThe police officer said he was told that Igboho could disappear or turn into a cat, and many other things were said to the police officers which made them tie him.\u201d\n\nHe noted it took his timely intervention for the officers to unchain him and allow him (Igboho) walk freely, explaining Igboho did not commit any offence but he is just a human rights activist.\n\nGiving an update on Igboho\u2019s case, Falola assured he is safe in the Benin Republic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe case will make revelations as to which government is powerful in Africa, our government may not be wealthy, and not much in population as compared to Nigeria but there is a signed treaty that must be respected.\n\n\u201cIgboho cannot be left to return back to Nigeria for now because of the destruction of his properties that was witnessed, they are not looking for Sunday Igboho alone but planning to kill him.\n\n\u201cThey are looking for how to kill him and that\u2019s very dangerous to allow him return back to Nigeria. So he is being kept safe in custody.\u201d\n\nAlthough the investigation is still ongoing, Falola explained he is monitoring the developments going on in Nigeria before any application for Igboho\u2019s freedom in court can be made.\n\nHe added that if Igboho is released, He may proceed to Germany to see his children and family.\n\n\u201cThis case has become a global one with many watching the developments, all Yorubas especially in Diaspora, monarchs, traditionalists, others are keenly following the case,\u201d Falola stated.",

He, therefore, demanded adequate compensation for the officer for the aggravated assault he suffered.\n\nSaid Nwannebuike: \u201cWe urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, National Assembly and every other critical and relevant arm and agency of government to deploy all means necessary to ensure the prompt procurement and execution of justice against the unprovoked, barbaric, and inhuman treatment of the diplomat by officers expected to have been trained in the discharge of their duties. Adequate compensation for the officer\u2019s treatment and for the aggravated assault suffered by him must also be demanded and obtained as soon as possible. This is one of the many ways to assuage the feelings of Nigerians for the shame and disgrace suffered by the diplomat and Nigerians in general.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, the unprovoked barbaric manhandling of the Nigerian diplomat is not only a violation of his rights but also a deliberate attempt to puncture the sovereign integrity of Nigeria as the pride of Africa. This should not be condoned. The United Nations, other relevant world bodies and lovers of peace must rise to the occasion to investigate the matter dispassionately and impose the appropriate sanctions as a deterrent to other countries.\n\n\u201cAs it were, foreign service officers have become apprehensive for their safety. This should not be the case. The Federal Government and other world bodies must therefore show, by their handling of this matter, that foreign service officers anywhere in the world are safe and sound and free from any kind of harassment. We affirm our total support to the Government of Nigeria in all her steps and efforts in this.\u201d",

They said that it sparked a fire after spilling its content.\n\nA resident of the area who claimed to be at the scene when the incident occurred said the tanker was stationary when another articulated vehicle suspected to have lost its brakes rammed into it.\n\n\u2018Several luxury buses parked around the area immediately went up in flames.

          "text": "\u2022Salutes ex-military president on his 80th birthday\n\nBy Obinna Chima\n\nBillionaire businessman, Femi Otedola, has recalled the role played by former Military President, General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, in the political logjam caused by the prolonged sickness of the late president Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua in 2010, when he asked former president Goodluck Jonathan to assert himself at their next Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting by sitting on the president\u2019s seat.\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua failing to formally transfer power to his deputy, Jonathan, when he was flown abroad for medical treatment, there was tension across the nation as a result of the power vacuum, which led to several public protests.\n\nIn his forthcoming book on business lessons, scheduled for release in November, Otedola revealed that Babangida had sent a message through him to then Vice President Jonathan, to sit on the empty seat of the President in the next FEC meeting and by implication, send a message to all concerned then that he understood the nuances of power and politics.\n\nOtedola, who joined million other people across the world to felicitate with Babangida, who would be 80 years tomorrow, Tuesday, August 17, Wished the retired general more rewarding years and thanked him also for all that he represented and still represents.\n\nWriting on the need for entrepreneurs to engage with political authorities in one of the chapters of his new book, Otedola maintained that such a relationship would benefit the country.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs\u2019 outreach and dialogue with political leaders, among many positives, will ensure stability and social coherence, guaranteeing economic progress.\n\n\u201cWorried by the tension and uncertainty, I decided to do something on my own. In the first week of February 2010, I went to Minna, Niger state, along with Hajia Bola Shagaya, to commiserate with General Ibrahim Babangida over the death of his wife, Maryam.\n\n\u201cAt his Hilltop residence, we spoke on a wide range of issues, but I told him I needed to discuss an urgent and vital issue. He took me to his study, where the two of us were alone. I told him that the state of the nation had been agitating my mind,\u201d he stated.\n\nOtedola said he then asked Babangida: \u201cYour Excellency, how can we get out of this logjam? The political heat is too much.\n\n\u201cCalm and resolute, IBB replied: \u2018Femi, advise your friend that when he gets to the Council Chambers next week for the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, he should go and sit on the President\u2019s chair.\u2019\n\n\u201cI found that fascinating and assured him I would pass the message across. I travelled back to Abuja by road in the evening and went straight to have dinner with Dr. Jonathan. I did not waste time in delivering General Babangida\u2019s message to him,\u201d he wrote.\n\nContinuing, he added: \u201cHe nodded and asked me: \u2018What do you think?\u2019 I laughed and said, \u2018Be a man, Your Excellency. Go and sit on that chair!\u2019 He looked at me for some time and responded that he would think about it.\n\n\u201cA week later, on Tuesday, February 9, the National Assembly adopted the famous \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019 to make Dr. Jonathan the Acting President pending the return of President Yar\u2019Adua from his medical\n\n\u201cBehind-the-scene moves by prominent Nigerians preceded this decision. The legislative resolution was unprecedented, but the nation had been tensed up. The fault lines were so stoked that an unusual solution was needed to address the unique situation.\n\n\u201cWith Jonathan now legally empowered to act as President, there remained the critical optics: would he stand-in for the President confidently and authoritatively? Or would he try to maintain a subdued outlook? The following day was the FEC meeting. As Dr Jonathan entered the Council Chamber, he made to sit on the chair of the Vice President\u2014his usual seat.\n\n\u201cAs the protocol officer pulled out the VP\u2019s chair, Dr. Jonathan marched towards the seat reserved for the President. And he sat on it! That was the moment Dr Goodluck Jonathan took control of power. By that act, he sent a strong signal to all Nigerians that he was now in charge. The same day, Jonathan even reshuffled the cabinet.\u201d\n\nYar\u2019Adua died on May 5, 2010, and Jonathan was sworn in as his replacement, going on to win the 2011 presidential elections and serving one term in office.\n\nIn the book, Otedola said entrepreneurs must engage with political authorities, because it was only when there was peace that the economy could boom.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWhile many may see political engagement for entrepreneurs as one-sided\u2014in the sense that only the entrepreneur benefits\u2014the reality is that it could work both ways. I tapped into my political connections to contribute my little quota to resolving a power crisis that almost set the country on fire.\n\n\u201cThis example is one of the several instances in which I used my access to the seat of power and political heavyweights to contribute to nation-building and national development. Entrepreneurs need to appreciate the fact that peace for the country is peace for their businesses, too. We need a stable and peaceful country first and foremost.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022We\u2019ll defeat them one highway, one rail link, one job at a time, president boasts\n\n\u2022States continent needs more than US Military aid to defeat terror\n\n\u2022Laments COVID-19 has been like oxygen for terrorism\n\n\u2022Declares building infrastructure, connecting remote regions, providing jobs will strengthen Africa\u2019s defences\n\n\u2022Justifies rail line to Niger Republic\n\nBy Obinna Chima\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said in an article he penned in the Financial Times of London, that with the United States pullout from Afghanistan and the subsequent fall of Kabul to the Taliban, that Africa has automatically become the new frontline of terror and global militancy.\n\nHe, stated that for Africa to defeat the growing terrorism on its soil, it would require more than the United States military aid but the entire world coming together for its sake.\n\nBuhari, who also believed that the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, had provided some form of oxygen for insurgents to sustain their hostilities globally, reiterated that, \u201cAfrica\u2019s fight against terror is the world\u2019s fight.\u201d\n\nIn the article he expressed optimism that Africa would defeat the terrorist, \u201cone highway, one rail link \u2014 and one job \u2014 at a time.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, the day the article was published, (yesterday) by the FT, was the day Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the global hub of America\u2019s terror war, fall to the Taliban.\n\nHis words: \u201cThough some believe the war on terror winds down with the US departure from Afghanistan, the threat it was supposed to address burns fiercely on my continent. Africa is the new frontline of global militancy. Yet few expect the outlay expended here to be as great as in Afghanistan. The fight against terrorism begun under the George W. Bush administration was never truly global.\n\n\u201cDespite rising attacks across Africa in the past decade, international assistance has not followed in step. Mozambique is merely the latest African state in danger from terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe Sahel remains vulnerable to Boko Haram, 20 years after its formation, and other radical groups. Somalia is in its second decade fighting the equally extreme al-Shabaab. Many African nations are submerged under the weight of insurgency,\u201d he added.\n\nFurthermore, Buhari noted that the Sahel remained vulnerable to Boko Haram, 20 years after the sect\u2019s formation and other radical groups.\n\nHe pointed out that Somalia was in its second decade fighting the equally extreme al-Shabaab, just as many African nations have been submerged under the weight of insurgency.\n\n\u201cAs Africans, we face our day of reckoning just as some sense the west is losing its will for the fight. It is true that some of our western allies are bruised by their Middle Eastern and Afghan experiences.\n\n\u201cOthers face domestic pressures after the pandemic. Africa was not then, and even less now, their priority,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nHowever, he said the threat could not be ignored, saying the Covid-19 had been like oxygen for terrorism, allowing it to gain in strength while the world was preoccupied.\n\nWhile calling for global action, he warned that sooner or later, the reverberations would be felt beyond Africa.\n\nIf extremist groups were able to hold territory, it could inspire disillusioned people living in the west to commit heinous acts of terror in their own countries, he stressed.\n\nThe president pointed out that the self-proclaimed caliphate of Daesh in Iraq and Syria fulfilled that propaganda function, boosting transcontinental recruitment.\n\n\u201cWe must not complacently assume that military means alone can defeat the terrorists. If Afghanistan has taught us a lesson, it is that although sheer force can blunt terror, its removal can cause the threat to return.\n\n\u201cThe US and its western allies cannot be expected to underpin the security of others everywhere and indefinitely. Africa has enough soldiers of our own,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nigerian president said more could be done in Africa to help with technical assistance, advanced weaponry, intelligence and ordinance, saying the US air strikes last month against al-Shabaab in Somalia \u2014 the first of the Biden administration \u2014 showed what could and should be done.\n\nHe, however, maintained that what Africa needed most from the US would be a comprehensive partnership to close the disparity between its economic and demographic growth.\n\n\u201cDespite having six of the world\u2019s top 10 fastest-growing economies, my continent\u2019s gross domestic product gains are insufficient to provide for burgeoning populations.\n\n\u201cSince the start of the US-led war on terror in 2001, Africa\u2019s population has nearly doubled. Every day, every month, this means more unemployed or underemployed entering the labour market, far outstripping economic expansion.\n\n\u201cA lack of hope is the chief recruiting sergeant for the continent\u2019s new brand of terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\nAdditionally, he explained that, the continent needed above all, an investment in infrastructure, pointing out that transport and freight lines could spread opportunity across nation\u2019s unequal in economic strength.\n\n\u201cIn parts of Africa, a government\u2019s grip on remote territories can be tenuous. Militant groups step into the void. Some even provide a form of governance, however perverse. These areas must be connected with their surroundings.\n\n\u201cThe recent attacks in Cabo Delgado in northern Mozambique illustrate the point. Their target was a vast natural gas project, part of an international investment, which extracts wealth but provides few jobs for locals.\n\n\u201cThis fuels grievances in a poverty-stricken province. It is a landing pad for the likes of Daesh,\u201d he added.\n\nBuhari also justified the federal government\u2019s ongoing railway construction to Niger Republic, saying it was in line with efforts to tackle insecurity and terrorism in the region.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThat is why we in Nigeria have begun building a train line from the southern coast through the north-east to Niger, our neighbour.\n\n\u201cMy government has been accused of wasting money, because trade between our two nations is minimal. But that is hardly a surprise, given that there is no trade infrastructure between us.\n\n\u201cThe train line will pay dividends in security, a prerequisite for economic growth. Some will remember that Boko Haram originated in north-eastern Nigeria, along the border with Niger.

          "text": "Hameed Ali, the comptroller-general of customs, has asked the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to set up filling stations in neighbouring countries to tackle oil smuggling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli said this on Monday at an interactive session organised by the house of representatives committee on finance on the 2022-2024 medium term expenditure framework/fiscal strategy paper (MTEF/FSP) for ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) in Abuja.\n\nNigeria has seen a surge in the activities of oil smugglers in recent times, impacting the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nIn June, NNPC had said smuggling across the borders increased the consumption of premium motor spirit (PMS) to 102 million litres per day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbdulahi Saidu, a member of the committee from Niger, had asked Ali to explain the surge in oil smuggling leading to a daily rise in the consumption of PMS.\n\nResponding, Ali said customs had advised NNPC to establish petrol stations in neighbouring countries.\n\nThis, he said, would tackle oil smuggling and enable the country to make revenue and \u201ccompletely diminish the anxiety or the penchant for smuggling\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have also proposed to NNPC, if the price differential is the problem, we have our banks \u2014 Zenith Bank, GT Bank \u2014operating in the West coast, what stops us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNNPC or Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) should establish petrol stations in our neighbouring countries, and move these products at the cost that we sell, and sell to this people, we will make money, we have the market and by so doing we will completely diminish the anxiety or the penchant for smuggling.\n\n\u201cIf a Beninese will get the fuel at the price we are getting and the cost of transportation, which is the minimal, there is no way he will wait for people to import to him at twice the price. We have made this proposal, we have made noise about it, no one seems to listen\n\n\u201cThere is hardly anything we can do to stop the smuggling of fuel outside the country because they use the creeks, they use land borders, they use virtually everything possible, we cannot be everywhere, we must begin to think out of the box. We should extend our petrol stations into these countries. We should move these products there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you recalled, when we closed the border, NNPC recorded a drastic drop in fuel that is being released to the public, and all of a sudden, we have opened four entrances on our land borders, and yet we have seen historical increases in terms of the quantity being reported as being consumed or released. This, I must say, we have a very porous border\u2014a very lengthy border and very porous.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we have, by the aid of the NNPC, created so many filling stations right at the border, and Mr Chairman, these filling stations get daily supply, and when they get these supplies, they release the supply in the tank at night, and by the morning, it has been siphoned.\u201d\n\nAli asked the committee to investigate the operations of DPR in granting licenses to filling stations 20km close to the borders.\n\n\u201cThat is why we said, filling stations that are 20km of the border should not be given petroleum products. We must monitor DPR \u2014 are these figures really what are being released? This thing keeps going up and down,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a series of meeting with the DPR, they said most of those filling stations at the border are illegal, so we said, give us the names and list of those illegal fuelling stations, then we will take care of the legal ones, three years after, we have not received one name.\n\n\u201cThese are the problems. There is a law that says that no Nigerian fueling station should be established within 10km to the border. But DPR will do their survey, they will issue licences to people to operate there.

          "text": "US President Joe Biden says he stands by his decision to withdraw his country\u2019s troops from Afghanistan, in spite of the current developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfghanistan has witnessed a gradual takeover of various provincial cities \u2014 including Kabul, the country\u2019s capital \u2014 by Taliban fighters over the recent weeks, following the withdrawal of US forces.\n\nAs of Sunday, President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan fled the country, and based his decision on the need to \u201cavoid bloodshed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban have made it to remove me, they are here to attack all Kabul and the people of Kabul. In order to avoid the bleeding flood, I thought it was best to get out. Taliban have won the judgement of sword and guns and now they are responsible for protecting the countrymen\u2019s honor, wealth and self-esteem,\u201d Ghani had said in a post on his Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs many Afghans attempt to flee the country and the US is currently evacuating its troops and other citizens, stakeholders have expressed concern over what the future holds for the south Asian country, since Taliban fighters have taken over.\n\nSpeaking at a media briefing on Monday, Biden said his government was aware of the risks associated with the withdrawal of US troops, but maintained that he took the right decision.\n\nAccording to him, there was no point allowing American military forces die while fighting for the Afghan people, if the citizens of the south Asian country are unwilling to defend themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I\u2019ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw US forces. That\u2019s why we\u2019re still there. We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency, but I always promised the American people that I would be straight with you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated. So, what\u2019s happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed sometime without trying to fight. If anything, the developments of the past week reinforce that any US military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision.\n\n\u201cAmerican troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Biden, the US provided all the necessary resources for the Afghan military force to take its stand, adding that the south Asian country needs to decide what it wants for itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe spent over a trillion dollars. We trained and equipped an Afghan military force with some 300,000 strong and credibly well-equipped \u2014 a force larger in size than many of our military\u2019s NATO allies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries, provided for the maintenance of their force \u2014 something the Taliban doesn\u2019t have. We provided close air support. We gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.\u201d",

          "title": "Iyin Aboyeji, Caleb Zipperstien, on why Future Africa is opening an office in Israel",
          "text": "Last week, a former general associate with leading Isreali VC OurCrowd Caleb Zipperstien, announced his appointment as a venture partner with Future Africa, and the launch of their Israeli office. This was a bit of a surprise as most local startups or funds have historically looked to Europe or Asia, as alternative sources of capital. So we sat down with Future Africa co-founder Iyin Aboyeji and Caleb to get some insight behind the move.\n\nAdegoke: Iyin. You have a reputation of being ahead of the curve and spotting the next best startup idea or trend so I\u2019m curious. Why are you opening an office in Tel Aviv, Israel? When everyone else is looking to the West then maybe Asia, for capital?\n\nIyin: The first reason is Caleb. You can\u2019t go to Israel without a professional like Caleb to support you both in terms of his political savvy with the existing prime minister\u2019s office and experience and numbers with Israeli VC OurCrowd which is a firm that is tailored after ours. Working with Caleb was the first direction. I think we would have worked with Caleb anywhere he was in the world.\n\nThe other benefit is when we think of the kind of challenges we face here, from security to agriculture, I think there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the Israeli venture community. We are in the US you know. So it\u2019s not a question of us looking away from the West but really looking in places where others wouldn\u2019t, to find a new class of limited partners (LPs).\n\nAdegoke: What does the current state of ecosystem relationship between Africa and Israel look like and where will Future Africa take that relationship to?\n\nIyin: There\u2019s been a long history, maybe hidden, when it comes to things like cybersecurity. A lot of us know Cybersun. That\u2019s an Israeli firm in Nigeria. Even agriculture. A lot of drip irrigation technology that is used across the country is Israeli tech.\n\nCaleb: Yeah. Netafim. In fact, they announced last year a $60 million deal or something like that with Rwanda. Tala communications which is in Kenya raised from an Israeli VC. Zipline raised from an Israeli VC. There are lots of collaborations. Today, Israel has three direct flights to Addis Ababa and their schedules were barely altered during the pandemic.\n\nIyin: My mindset is there are hidden relationships between the Nigerian and Israeli tech communities. It\u2019s not at an all-time high though. So there\u2019s an opportunity for us to really build that with Caleb in Israel, get more Israeli LPs, people that are very optimistic about technology and its use for solving real problems. And we\u2019re not stopping with Tel Aviv. At the moment, we\u2019re having conversations about an office opening in Dubai and London. We\u2019re going to be scaling Future Africa very fast around the world and building this global investment firm that\u2019s focused on Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAdegoke: How did you meet Caleb?\n\nIyin: I had this bunch of really interesting calls with Caleb. He reached out to me when he was thinking about moving to Rwanda during the pandemic to learn about and explore the innovation and VC ecosystem in Africa. We met online and started talking a lot and I told him that a good way for him to get involved would be to work with us especially around investor success. This is because he comes with that understanding of how to get investors infectiously excited about Africa.\n\nCaleb Zipperstien\n\nAdegoke: I agree! Caleb is always enthusiastic every time I speak with him.\n\nIyin: Yeah. That\u2019s the kind of energy we need in our firm to bring more investment into Africa.\n\nAdegoke: How would you characterize the Israeli ecosystem in terms of the size of investments, the biggest startups, or entrepreneurs?\n\nCaleb: What\u2019s going on in the Israeli ecosystem is that the economy is maturing. We\u2019re seeing more unicorns and growth deals than ever before. There were 19 IPOs last year. We\u2019re not seeing less private capital coming into the country but we\u2019re seeing a little bit less of early-stage investing. I\u2019m a little bit curious if this then presents some market opportunity for investors who are looking for early-stage deals. Through the pandemic, Israelis have these key hidden records in fundraising. We\u2019ve had more unicorns, Lemonade, and two companies\u2019 IPO recently. The former commander of the Israeli Mossad, the most elite secret service spy agency in the world, was just hired to be Israel\u2019s representative for SoftBank. It\u2019s crazy what is happening within the tech ecosystem in terms of big solutions. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister was a cybersecurity entrepreneur and an investor. The former mayor of Jerusalem made his money as an early investor in Checkpoint Cybersecurity. Generally, through the pandemic, the Israeli tech ecosystem has grown, the values have grown, the companies have matured. Now the question really is how this affects the early stage landscape. Israel will always be entrepreneurial, innovative, looking to solve problems. I\u2019m interested in if there\u2019ll be more opportunities for collaboration with neighbouring markets, which in this case would include Africa.\n\nAdegoke: Outside of Israel, which market would you say receives most of Israeli tech investment?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019d say Silicon Valley. VCs like Ribbon Capital. I think Ribbon led the last round in ChipperCash. So there could be a really interesting Israeli-African connection. I\u2019m really hoping that Israeli innovators will look to Africa and also that Israeli startups, growth companies, and corporate venture funds in Israel will be working closely with Future Africa and its portfolio companies. There\u2019s a huge fintech following but there are not enough jobs for Israelis. There\u2019s room for more great fintech but seeing the fintech boom in Africa, we think there could be some great ways for talent exchange and collaboration.\n\nAdegoke: Is the predominant investment thesis in Israel similar to what we have here? Beyond key sectors like fintech, do you see investors putting their money in other business areas?\n\nCaleb: Israel is not a B2C market. We\u2019ve also very recently have become more of a scale-up market. There are many startups that were sold for hundreds of millions of dollars before they were even selling a single product. In Africa, the way to become a unicorn is to have a great product, management team, execution. I think the potential ways in which Israel is.\n\nIyin: Caleb\u2019s remit is going to go beyond Israel. So the presence in Israel is just a part of the full picture. We want to be visible to investors, particularly to those that can add a lot of value to our portfolio. And this is where we may be looking for partnerships and solutions. Like in Dubai, there\u2019s a whole bunch of companies coming particularly from Europe who leverage Israel as their premier headquarters. Caleb\u2019s going to be working with us across the world, with our investors. We currently have over 300 investors from across the world. And we\u2019re looking to further scale our presence for investors all over the world \u2013 from current offices in the U.S., Tel Aviv, and Lagos, with plans to set up in London, Dubai, etc, \u2013 and we\u2019re hiring quite a number of people for the expansion.\n\nAdegoke: Nice! How do you plan to sell the African story to entrepreneurs and investors?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019m going to show them articles on TechCabal which have been showing stories about big rounds in companies, startups reaching unicorn status, Paystack getting sold, Flutterwave creating the impact that they\u2019ve had, and reaching business milestones that they\u2019ve had. The numbers don\u2019t lie. The number of deals in Africa is growing year over year \u2013 literally at an out-of-control pace. And early investors in those deals have been able to benefit demonstrably from those wins which is the embodiment of VC \u2013 high risk, high reward. Honestly, I cannot think of a better person to introduce the African VC ecosystem to this country than E because of his experience as an entrepreneur and an investor.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2Africa project, championed by social media giant, Facebook and seven other companies \u2014 China Mobile International, MTN GlobalConnect, Orange, stc, Telecom Egypt, Vodafone, and WIOCC \u2014 is adding four new branches to its 37,000km undersea Internet cable.\n\nThe new branches extend the cable\u2019s connectivity to Seychelles, Angola, the Comoro Islands and a new landing in South-East Nigeria. They will join the recently announced extension to the Canary Islands.\n\nPer Facebook\u2019s statement, the new branches will be deployed by Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) \u2014 Nokia-owned cable systems provider \u2014 and will increase the number of 2Africa landings to 35 in 26 countries.\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook announced this project, a cable connection it says would provide nearly three times the total network capacity of all the subsea cables serving Africa today.\n\nFacebook says considerable progress has been made, and the cable is expected to go live in late 2023. Most of the subsea route survey activity is now complete as ASN has started manufacturing the cable to deploy the first segments in 2022.\n\nIt also says one of the cable\u2019s key segments, the Egypt terrestrial crossing \u2014 interconnects landing sites on the Red and the Mediterranean Seas via two completely diverse terrestrial routes \u2014 has been completed ahead of schedule. A third diverse marine path will complement this segment via the Red Sea.\n\nAfrica struggles with Internet connectivity. According to a 2020 GSM Association Factsheet, mobile Internet adoption in sub-Saharan Africa stood at 26% in 2019. The region accounts for almost half of the global population not covered by a mobile broadband network\n\nAs the International Telecommunications Union\u2019s Digital Trends Report 2021 reveals, infrastructure is not the real problem. As of the end of 2019, 28 African countries had at least one submarine cable landing.\n\nAccording to data from Many Possibilities, the West and East African coasts each have cables with an Internet capacity of at least 100 Tbps. By the end of 2021, the number could double.\n\nAs we noted in an earlier article, more subsea cables do not translate to faster Internet capacity. Service providers might only have to pay less to connect due to increased competition. In principle, this should reduce the cost of data for end-users.\n\nHowever, this might not always be the case. For example, Nigeria is said to have the least affordable Internet in the world.",

This year, SME Clinic will be held on Saturday, August 21, 2021 at Zone Tech Park, Gbagada Expressway, Lagos.\n\nLast year, the COVID-19 pandemic reminded us of the Internet\u2019s importance. So, for SME Clinic 2021, we\u2019ve put together an amazing lineup of speakers to teach small business owners how to leverage tech in their businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWondering what you should expect? Find out here: What to expect at SME Clinic 2021\n\nAlso, here are 3 reasons not to miss SME Clinic 2021.\n\nThis year\u2019s Clinic promises to be value-packed. There will be learning, unlearning, networking, and growth.\n\nWhere can you get tickets? Just head on to https://smeclinic.techpoint.africa/ and get your early bird tickets at a discounted rate.\n\nMeanwhile, you can read testimonials from SME Clinic 2020, here.\n\nFacebook Messenger gets more privacy features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Brett Jordan</a> on <a\n\nFacebook is adding an option for end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to voice and video calls on Messenger. It announced this in a blog post on Friday, August 13, 2021.\n\nWhat does this mean? You can now make calls on Messenger without fear of Facebook \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 listening in on you. In principle, E2EE blocks anyone other than you and the person you call from hearing what you are saying.\n\nIt\u2019s not automatic: Messenger already gives you the option to enable E2EE for your text chats. But, you have to turn it on yourself because it\u2019s not a default setting. And it works the same way for voice and video calls. Also, you\u2019d have to be friends or have an existing chat for this to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I still used my cobweb-infested Facebook account, you can bet I would be turning this feature on. But, that\u2019s just a personal preference.\n\nThere\u2019s more: Facebook has updated controls for Disappearing Messages. Now, new messages have a window of between 5 seconds and 24 hours before being permanently deleted.\n\nIt is also bringing the E2EE option to Messenger Group texts and calls and Instagram Direct Messages. It will be testing these features in the next few months.\n\nE2EE is already being used on messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram.\n\nTwitter pauses verification roll-out process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash\n\nReally, again? For the second time in three months, Twitter is pausing its verification roll-out process. The company announced this in a tweet on Friday, August 13, 2021.\n\nTwitter first restarted the process in May 2021 after pausing it in November 2017. A week later, the company said the process would be halted due to an avalanche of requests and to review submissions.\n\nWhy the latest pause? Well, the company said it\u2019s \u201cso we can make improvements to the application and review process.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Twitter admitted that it had inadvertently verified several \u201cinauthentic\u201d accounts in a statement given to Daily Dot. This occurred after a tweet on July 12, 2021 \u2014 by tweeter, Conspirador Norte\u00f1o, a data scientist focused on disinformation \u2014 highlighted six newly-created accounts that were verified.\n\nHow does this affect you? If your profile doesn\u2019t show the \u2018verification request\u2019 option, then you might have to exercise some more patience. This doesn\u2019t apply to people who can already apply to be verified \u2014 lucky them.\n\nAccording to Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter Product Lead, \u201cto clarify, we haven\u2019t paused applications. We\u2019ve been gradually rolling out *access to* the application (it\u2019s not at 100% yet) and that roll-out is paused until we can better handle the scale. For those it\u2019s been rolled out to, we\u2019re still accepting and processing applications.\u201d\n\nWhat next? We wait. Per The Verge, a Twitter Spokesperson says that it would \u201cresume rolling out applications in the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nNetflix Isn\u2019t The Savior Nollywood Needs.

It is duly licensed by the PenCom to carry on business as a Pension Fund Administrator as defined under the Pension Reform Act, 2014. FCMB Pensions is a subsidiary of FCMB Group Plc.\n\nChief executive officer of one of the PFAs, who does not want his name mentioned, said, \u201cAs a company we are doing something about our recapitalisation, but I will like to give you details when I have gotten approval from PenCom.\u201d\n\nThe industry will not remain the same after the recapitalisation exercise, the CEO noted, but I hope to see some consolidation in the industry after the expiration of the compliance deadline.",

          "text": "\u2018I Married Two Wives Same Day So That I Can Always Have An Alternative\u2019 \u2013 Delta Farmer\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWARRI \u2013 Thirty three (33) year old farmer, Akpove Blessing, from Isoko in Delta State , whose photograph with his two wives surfaced on social media last week of his intention to marry two wives on Sunday, August 15, 2021, has said his decision was borne out of his desire to always have an alternative to fall back on.\n\nSpeaking with the Nigerian Observer on Sunday at Lagos-Igbide, Isoko South Local Government Area, Delta State, where the wedding took place, Akpove, added that although he is not rich, he married the two wives in order to have an alternative when one of them is not ready for conjugal activity.\n\n\u200c\u201d You know that women can be difficult at times; so I took the decision so that, when there is a problem with one, or I hurt any of them, I can always fall back on my other wife, to satisfy myself\u201d\n\n\u201c But my father didn\u2019t marry more than one,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe said although the two wives already had six children (four boys and two girls) for him, the Sunday ceremony was the climax of the event which had started the previous day(Saturday) with visits to his in-laws for the official payment of bride price to the two families ,one after the other.\n\n\u201cMy first wife is the one that they brought to me first. I married two wives because I love to marry two women.\n\nHe admonished men to marry as many wives as possible rather than running after side chicks and endanger their lives.\n\n\u201cRegarding cheating, that\u2019s why it\u2019s good to marry as many as possible. I don\u2019t want to behave like those big men or Nigerian politicians who keep their wives at home and go after side chicks old enough to be their daughters so as to satisfy their appetite.\n\n\u201cThey bear my name. We live together. They have children for me already. My firstborn is 11years old . I started dating them at different times. I\u2019m a farmer. Only God is blessing me to care for them. With little work, God helps me.\n\n\u201cOne of them is a hairdresser and the other a nurse. They\u2019re not really rich. I wish I can be empowered to cater for them: such as making me minister of women affairs. That could help and will help me maintain their beautiful looks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a burden to marry two. But with Nigeria economy now, the only that gives a man happiness is women; you\u2019re not rich to enjoy life, the other thing that can make you happy is women.\n\n\u201d If you\u2019re rich and your manhood is not functioning, anger will take over you.\n\n\u201cMy friends love it. They encourage me. Though they do not marry two wives. I\u2019ll keep encouraging my wives that things will be better. Both have two boys and one girl each. So both have given me four boys, two girls.\n\n\u201cTo manage them is in God\u2019s hands. I\u2019m a Christian, but not a man of God, I am just a churchgoer .Solomon had several. I only have two. I believe God will help me to care for them. If one shuns me, I go to the other for solace. I love them equally. I\u2019ll have both of them by my side for our honeymoon in the hotel room,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nOne of the wives, which he addressed as the first one, Oghenekome Okoro alias Kome, however, said she would not be pleased if her husband goes for more wives.\n\n\u201cI like my husband marrying two of us. I know that if my second cooperates with me, we\u2019ll live peacefully like sisters. We don\u2019t envy each other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known my husband for 12 years. It\u2019s not a big thing to marry two wives. Instead of having side chicks like even some pastors do, is it not better to marry two wives?\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t allow him to marry another wife again. We two are enough for him,\u201d she quipped.\n\nOn her part, the second wife, Oghenemaro, said , it will be fine, if her husband decides to marry additional wife.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with it; I cannot stop that decision. It will be okay by me\u201d . She said.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has said the appeal committee set up by the national Secretariat of the party to see to the petition of the aftermath of the recently concluded Ward Congress in the state has not completed it\u2019s work as there are lots of petitions yet to be attended to, just as the group expressed confident in the committee.\n\nThe chairman of the group, Rev. Lowo Adebiyi stated this while addressing newsmen in Osogbo on Sunday.\n\nThe group denied allegation that it led political thugs to invade the party Secretariat during the Ward Congress Appeal Committee sitting on Saturday.\n\nIt would be recalled that the prty caretaker chairman, Prince Gboyega Famodun and some members of Governor Gboyega Oyetola\u2019s cabinet had earlier accused TOP chairman, Adebiyi of leading the attack on members of the party.\n\nResponding to the allegation, the group noted that their petitioners were at the secretariat to submit their petitions.\n\nRepresented at the press conference by the vice chair who also doubles as the party caretaker secretary, Rasaq Salinsile, Adelewo stated that they got there early as they had confidence in the Appeal Committee, adding they had several petitions and wanted justice.\n\nHe the wondered how a group that has confidence in the committee filled with experienced elders will cause violence.\n\nThe party chieftain said, \u201cwe dare say that the Governor and his group and thus choose violence and impunity to either get their way forcefully or get us emasculated.\n\n\u201cWe saw this coming and we had taking the right path of law and order. While the Osun Progressives was rising and getting popular, Governor Oyetola and his group\u2019s popularity were nose-diving. That is the path that led to attacks on party members of the Osun Progressives who had thronged the party Secretariat to present their appeal to the committee.\n\n\u201cHoodlums with Oyetola 4+4 face caps were drafted to the secretariat to dislodge the party members who had been calmly going before the Appeal Committee to present their cases. The resolute members resisted the invasion and walked the thugs out. The thugs yielded to awesome number and left in shame.\n\n\u201cThe sitting was going on smoothly and everybody thought reason had prevailed and the worst was over. But then, there was this comic relief on the social media where a Commissioner in the Oyetola\u2019s cabinet posted a scam of a material alleging the Chairman of TOP of bringing thugs to attack the committee members.\n\n\u201cThe picture that the female commissioner put to illustrate her lies showed a person holding Governor Oyetola\u2019s identity cap and you wonder how possible that the person carrying the Governor\u2019s support cap is a member of the committee? On enquiry, the man was in protection of one of the senior thugs when he hits his head against the gate,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThis is even as we at the TOP are determined to pursue this case to its logical conclusion through all known legal and socially rightful means, no matter what Governor Oyetola and his group are doing. We are convinced of the fact that impunity has an end.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that the Oyetola administration has find it easier to make enemies within his own party while the opposition is left to its own devices.\n\n\u201cWhile the opposition party is working hard to win the 2022 election, the Oyetola\u2019s government is busy excluding his co-party members, disuniting his party and making them to regret ever considering him as candidate in the first place and going ahead to make him win election at all cost.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola seems interested in winning second term ticket at all cost and not minding whatever that follows. Well, we live to see the way things go,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile reacting to attack on the stalwart of the party, Honourable Biyi Odunlade by the suspected thugs in Ile-Ife, Adelewo said the attack is what had been foreseen by the leadership of the party to occur.\n\nHe said they had earlier raised the alarm over alleged plans by suspected thugs allegedly working for governemnt to unleash terror on the leaders of the group.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the viciousness of the government and party officials, they have commenced in earnest, the attack and assassination attempt we reported. After the Osogbo party Secretariat, they made way to Ile Ife home of Hon. Biyi Odunlade,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe was lucky to have left home few minutes before the arrival of the hired political thugs. Otherwise, only God could say what would have become of him, taking into consideration the multiple dangerous weapons they stormed his abode with.\n\n\u201cHis wife, children and grandchildren were met at home and had to resort to various ways of escapes, leaving trails of injuries and massive destruction to the house. Mrs Odunlade had her groceries shop attached to the house looted and every other things destroyed. This is certainly a beginning of the fulfillment of our reported attacks and assassinations by the government\u2019s men.\u201d\n\nHe called on the security operatives and federal government to prevent bloodshed in the state, drawing their attention to planned attacks and assassination of TOP members.",

For example, their domestic animals are tettered with rope and are not allowed to roam about and graze on people\u2019s crops. They are kept in pens and fed. Ocassionally, they are taken out, tied with ropes and taken to uncultivated forests where they can chew fresh grass.\n\n\u201cWhen the domestic animals stray to destroy other people\u2019s farms, they are caught and sold off to pay for the crops eaten or destroyed.\n\n\u201cThe application of these customary laws does not depend on state or federal laws.

These call for caution and proactive actions, which should take into consideration, in the main, the review of the mode of teaching and learning in the second semester and, as a consequence, provide a safe way to undertake pedagogical activities on Nigerian university campuses.\n\n\u201cWith the daily rising cases of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and with several cases within the main campus and the College of Medicine/UCH campuses, the ERTC considered a proposal of blended teaching for the second semester in the university.\n\n\u201cThe blended learning model should be officially decided in terms, either of availability of sections of the student population for online or physical encounters or the categorization of courses as online or physical.\n\n\u201dThis neutralizes the choice of location or keeps all students, in principle, in physical presence within and/or around the campus,\u201d she said.\n\nFaluyi said the proposed platforms and tools to be used, according to the ERTC, include: LMS, Zoom, YouTube Gsuite accounts, Telegram fora, Solution clinics, which should be maintained for use by students and staff in all cases.\n\n\u201cGoogle Meet, which is practically free, should, in addition, be encouraged for lectures, since all academics have access to Gmail accounts.\n\n\u201cFirm decisions and systematicity should be applied on the preference for the operations of blended learning to ensure effectiveness,\u201d she said.\n\nShe noted that the management had decried the poor compliance with COVID-19 protocols by the entire university community and emphasised the need to ensure strict compliance through the university\u2019s COVID-19 Committee.\n\n\u201cIf the situation worsens on campus, full online engagement should be mounted for all courses as was done in the first semester, exempting only departments and units with special needs, on the condition that evident strict compliance with the protocols will be observed.\n\n\u201cBigger Zoom rooms for courses, with more than 1,800 students, should be purchased and added to the existing pool\u201d, Faluyi added.\n\nThe registrar enjoined everyone to take personal responsibility for his/her safety by obeying all COVID-19 safety protocols.\n\n\u201cIf we do this, there will be no cause for panic on our campus,\u201d she said.\n\nFaluyi also disclosed that arrangements were ongoing to make vaccines available for all staff and students, as soon as possible, the details of which would be provided as more progress is made, she said.\n\nNAN",

Items recovered from the surrendered terrorists include several AK 47 rifles and magazines, a locally made pistol, and eight locally fabricated daggers.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on 15 August 2021, the Theatre took custody of additional Boko Haram fighters, comprising of four adult males, 11 adult females, and 18 children from Landanli, Azah, Ngaridua, and Kondilla villages, who surrendered to own troops of 151 Task Force Battalion, Banki Junction in Bama.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu explained that the feat followed the recent massive surrendering of Boko Haram terrorists in Bama Operational area on August 2 and 4.\n\nSince then, he stated that there has been confusion and severe apprehension in the camps of the Islamic State of West Africa Province, especially among its top-ranking commanders over the depleting strength of its members which he said has drastically dwindled their overall fighting efficiency.\n\n\u201cIt is against the backdrop that the terrorist group opted for the use of propaganda via AMAQ Terrorists Media Wing with the aim to portray the group as if it is still a potent force in the North East,\u201d the army spokesman said.\n\nAccording to him, ISWAP is yet to come to terms with the reality of its current predicament which has posed a serious negative impact on its prowess.\n\nNwachukwu insisted that the terrorists were overwhelmed with palpable fear and were making desperate efforts to halt the surrendering of their fighters from the Tumbus and Sambisa axis.\n\nHe said the military remained resolute in intensifying both kinetic and non-kinetic efforts in the fight against insurgency, banditry, and sundry crimes in the country.",

          "text": "Billionaire businessman Femi Otedola has joined Nigerians in felicitating with former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida, who marks his 80th birthday on Tuesday, August 17.\n\nWishing him more rewarding years, Otedola on Sunday thanked the Retired General who is fondly called IBB for the role he played during the political logjam caused by the prolonged sickness of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua in 2010.\n\nIn his forthcoming book on business lessons \u2013 scheduled for release in November, Otedola revealed that General Babangida sent a message through him to the then-Vice President Goodluck Jonathan, to sit on the empty seat of President Yar\u2019Adua in the next Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\nWith Yar\u2019Adua failing to formally transfer power to his VP when he was flown abroad for medical treatment, there was tension across the nation as a result of the power vacuum, which led to public protests.\n\n\u201cWorried by the tension and uncertainty, I decided to do something on my own,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIn the first week of February 2010, I went to Minna, Niger State, along with Hajia Bola Shagaya, to commiserate with General Ibrahim Babangida over the death of his wife, Maryam.\n\n\u201cAt his Hilltop residence, we spoke on a wide range of issues, but I told him I needed to discuss an urgent and vital issue. He took me to his study, where the two of us were alone. I told him that the state of the nation had been agitating my mind.\u201d\n\nOtedola said he asked Babangida how the country could get out of the political logjam, emphasising that the political heat at the time was \u201ctoo much\u201d.\n\nHe said a \u201ccalm and resolute\u201d IBB replied: \u2018Femi, advise your friend that when he gets to the Council Chambers next week for the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, he should go and sit on the President\u2019s chair.\u2019\n\n\u201cI found that fascinating and assured him I would pass the message across,\u201d Otedola wrote, adding, \u201cI travelled back to Abuja by road in the evening and went straight to have dinner with Dr Jonathan. I did not waste time in delivering General Babangida\u2019s message to him.\n\n\u201cHe nodded and asked me, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\n\n\u201cI laughed and said, \u2018Be a man, Your Excellency. Go and sit on that chair!\u2019\n\n\u201cHe looked at me for some time and responded that he would think about it.\n\n\u201cA week later, on Tuesday, February 9, the National Assembly adopted the famous \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019 to make Dr Jonathan the Acting President pending the return of President Yar\u2019Adua from his medical leave. Behind-the-scene moves by prominent Nigerians preceded this decision. The legislative resolution was unprecedented, but the nation had been tensed up. The fault lines were so stoked that an unusual solution was needed to address the unique situation.\n\n\u201cWith Jonathan now legally empowered to act as President, there remained the critical optics: would he stand-in for the President confidently and authoritatively? Or would he try to maintain a subdued outlook? The following day was the FEC meeting. As Dr Jonathan entered the council chamber, he was made to sit on the chair of the Vice President\u2014his usual seat.\n\n\u201cAs the protocol officer pulled out the VP\u2019s chair, Dr Jonathan marched towards the seat reserved for the President. And he sat on it! That was the moment Dr Goodluck Jonathan took control of power. By that act, he sent a strong signal to all Nigerians that he was now in charge. The same day, Jonathan even reshuffled the cabinet.\u201d\n\nYar\u2019Adua died on May 5, 2010, and Jonathan was sworn in as his replacement, going on to win the 2011 presidential elections and serving one term in office.\n\nWriting on the need for entrepreneurs to engage with political authorities in one of the chapters of his book, Otedola maintained that such a relationship will benefit the country.\n\nAccording to him, entrepreneurs\u2019 outreach and dialogue with political leaders, among many positives, will ensure stability and social coherence, guaranteeing economic progress.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWhile many may see political engagement for entrepreneurs as one-sided\u2014in the sense that only the entrepreneur benefits\u2014the reality is that it could work both ways.\n\n\u201cI tapped into my political connections to contribute my little quota to resolving a power crisis that almost set the country on fire. This example is one of the several instances in which I used my access to the seat of power and political heavyweights to contribute to nation-building and national development. Entrepreneurs need to appreciate the fact that peace for the country is peace for their businesses, too. We need a stable and peaceful country first and foremost.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nOyebode, who featured as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, believes such a percentage amounts to nothing compared with the sufferings of the people of the affected areas.\n\n\u201cI think we have to recognise that what we really have are oil-bearing areas, they are not oil-producing (but) areas which bear oil, and the relationship between the international oil companies and the oil-bearing communities needs to be straightened out,\u201d he said on Monday.\n\n\u201cThree per cent is a pittance for those who suffer the incumbrances of producing oil. The concomitant effect of ravage of the environment, and then the fact of the unpleasantness of heat coming from fires, cancer and other things ravaging people inhabiting the area, need to be compensated for.\u201d\n\nThe professor was analysing how the recent signing of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) into law by President Muhammadu Buhari would affect the nation, especially the people in the oil-bearing communities.\n\nHe stressed the need for authorities to put into critical consideration the health condition of the people and the hardship they face \u2013 as a result of oil spills and other factors.\n\nWhile Oyebode described the presidential assent to the Act as a step in the right direction, he recommended further amendments of the act as one of the ways to address the concerns of the affected communities.\n\n\u201cWe all agree that the oil-bearing areas are the geese that lay the golden eggs, so they have to survive, and they have to be cushioned and defended from the vagaries of oil production,\u201d he said. \u201cTrying to smuggle in people over host territory, oil pipelines pass, I think it is being clever by half.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must be able to separate issues. It is taking such a long time to have the PIB, so we should not throw away the baby (as people say) with the bathwater. So, it is a fine place to start to see whether we need further amendments of the PIB going forward in order to make progress,\u201d the legal expert added.\n\nThe Petroleum Industry Act provides a legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the nation\u2019s petroleum sector, the development of host communities, and related matters.\n\nIt was initially passed by lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives chambers of the National Assembly on July 15 and 16 respectively.\n\nPresident Buhari assented to the act a month after the lawmakers gave the approval.",

          "text": "The Director General of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Salihu Lukman has called for local funding of Civil Society Organizations, CSOs, by the Federal Government in order to reduce their dependence on foreign donors.\n\nThe APC chieftain said the foreign donors have links with the government of their countries.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cCivil Society and Nigeria\u2019s Democratic Development\u201d, released on Monday, canvassed for greater level of collaboration between Federal government and Civil Society Organizations, CSOs, in the country in order to foster development and deepen Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nDr Salihu said the CSOs would continue to be loyal to the government of their foreign donors while dealing with FG as enemies so long as sources of funding for the work of these organizations were largely from foreign donors.\n\n\u201cSadly, this negative orientation has pushed leaders of civil society in Nigeria to develop a mindset, which encourages them to positively relate with foreign organizations that are directly linked to governments in their countries but despise considering developing a positive or structured relationship with the Nigerian government. It is basically a belief that accepts a relationship with foreign governments as good but the relationship with Nigerian government is bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInterestingly, however, individual leaders of civil society could have positive relations with functionaries of the Nigerian government. If it is okay for individual leaders of civil society to have positive relations with functionaries of the Nigerian government, why should civil society continue to resist negotiating improved relations with the Nigerian government? If Nigerian civil society can accept funding from foreign governments, why should it be difficult for them to take steps to negotiate structured local funding, which may include contributions from the Nigerian government?\u201d he said.\n\nThe PGF DG averred that the problem of poor relations between Nigerian government and civil society has produced combination of poor funding and very weak organisations of civil society in the country.\n\nThe PGF DG blamed the frosty relationship between government and CSOs on the background of repressive military rule, which he said made campaigns for human rights and democracy to become the primary focus of the work of civil society, while a negative mindset that translated to opposition to Nigerian government remained deep-rooted among civil society leaders.\n\nHe said Civil society leaders believe that opposition to government is a requirement for their work, while on the other hand, government functionaries have contempt for civil society and their leaders.\n\n\u201cWith all our realities in Nigeria, the consequence is that there are no guaranteed local funding sources available to support the work of civil society organisations. Sadly, there is no campaign in the country to create domestic funding sources for the work of civil society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy should relationship with Nigerian government be considered bad, but relationship with foreign governments good? Most activists in civil society pretentiously overlooked this issue largely because good relationship with foreign governments enable them to access grants from organisations such as the UK Department for International Development (DFID), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), European Union (EU), etc. These are basically funding directly provided by governments of UK, US and countries under the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhy should Nigerian civil society resent financial support from Nigerian government but accept from UK, US and EU governments? Isn\u2019t it possible to negotiate conditions that makes funding from Nigerian government acceptable? Part of the disadvantage of refusal to consider negotiating stronger relationship between Nigerian civil society organisations and Nigerian government is that work of these organisations are dictated by priorities set by foreign donor organisations,\u201d the statement said.",

          "title": "Seven Killed in Kabul Airport Chaos as Taliban Patrols Afghan Capital",
          "text": "\u201cThe world is following events in Afghanistan with a heavy heart and deep disquiet about what lies ahead,\u201d warned United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nAcross the nation, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that thousands had been wounded in fighting. Elsewhere, security forces and politicians handed over their provinces and bases without a fight, likely believing the two-decade Western experiment to remake Afghanistan would not survival the resurgent Taliban. The last American troops had planned to withdraw at the end of the month.\n\nThe crowds came while the Taliban enforced their rule over the capital of 5 million people after a lightning advance across the country that took just over a week to dethrone the country\u2019s Western-backed government. There were no major reports of abuses or fighting, but many residents stayed home and remained fearful after the insurgents\u2019 advance saw prisons emptied and armories looted.\n\nThousands of Afghans rushed into Kabul\u2019s main airport Monday, some so desperate to escape the Taliban that they held onto a military jet as it took off and plunged to their deaths. At least seven people died in the chaos, U.S. officials said, as America\u2019s longest war ended with its enemy the victor.\n\nAs the U.S. military and others continued evacuation flights, Afghans swarmed over the international airport\u2019s tarmac. Some climbed into aircraft parked on the taxiway, while others dangled precariously off a jet bridge.\n\nU.S. troops took positions to guard the active runway, but the crowd stormed past them and their armored vehicles. Gunshots rang out. As one U.S. Air Force Boeing C-17 Globemaster III tried to take off, a helicopter did low runs in front of it to try to drive people off the runway.\n\nVideos showed a group of Afghans hanging onto the plane just before takeoff and several falling through the air as the airplane rapidly gained altitude over the city.\n\nSenior American military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing operation, told The Associated Press that the chaos left seven dead, including several who fell from the flight. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said U.S. forces killed two people he described as carrying weapons in the melee. He said 1,000 more U.S. troops would be deployed to secure the airfield and back up the 2,500 already there.\n\nAll flights at the airport \u2014 both military and civilian \u2014 were halted until Afghan civilians can be cleared from the runway, Kirby added.\n\nLate Monday night, hundreds of people remained trapped between American forces trying to push them out of the airport and Taliban forces trying to keep them in, witnesses said. An Associated Press journalist also saw what appeared to be an airstrike target two vehicles near the airport.\n\nShafi Arifi, who had a ticket to travel to Uzbekistan on Sunday, was unable to board his plane because it was packed with people who had raced across the tarmac and climbed aboard, with no police or airport staff in sight.\n\n\u201cThere was no room for us to stand,\u201d said the 24-year-old. \u201cChildren were crying, women were shouting, young and old men were so angry and upset, no one could hear each other. There was no oxygen to breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter a woman fainted and was carried off the plane, Arifi gave up and returned home.\n\nOther Afghans, like Rakhmatula Kuyash, are also trying to leave through land border crossings, all of which are now controlled by the Taliban.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lost and I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Kuyash, who crossed into Uzbekistan on Sunday after leaving his children and relatives in Afghanistan. \u201cI left everything behind.\u201d\n\nOthers were not so lucky. Uzbekistan air defenses shot down an Afghan military aircraft that tried to enter the country without permission. The two pilots were reportedly injured and in custody.\n\nMeanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani, who earlier left the country, faced Russian allegations he fled Kabul with four cars and a helicopter full of cash. His whereabouts remained unclear.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy has been evacuated and the American flag lowered, with diplomats relocating to the airport to help with the evacuation. Other Western countries also closed their missions and were flying out staff and their citizens.\n\nIn interviews with U.S. television networks, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan blamed the Afghan military for the Taliban\u2019s rapid takeover, saying it lacked the will to fight.\n\nHowever, the ease with which the Taliban took control goes beyond military prowess, the Texas-based private intelligence firm Stratfor wrote.\n\n\u201cThe speed of the Taliban\u2019s final advance suggests less military dominance than effective political insurgency coupled with an incohesive Afghan political system and security force struggling with flagging morale,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Taliban offensive through the country stunned American officials. Just days before the insurgents entered Kabul with little if any resistance, a U.S. military assessment predicted it could take months for the capital to fall.\n\nThe rout threatened to erase 20 years of Western efforts to remake Afghanistan that saw tens of thousands of Afghans killed as well as more than 3,500 U.S. and allied troops. The initial invasion in 2001 drove the Taliban from power and scattered al-Qaida, which had planned the 9/11 attacks while being sheltered in Afghanistan.\n\nUnder the Taliban, which ruled in accordance with a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, women were largely confined to their homes and suspected criminals faced amputation or public execution. The insurgents have sought to project greater moderation in recent years, but many Afghans remain skeptical.\n\nJournalists so far have been able to work, though Taliban militants visited the private satellite channel Tolo TV looking for \u201cgovernment-issued weapons,\u201d said station owner Saad Mohsini. Some militants put on Afghan military uniforms and began doing patrols, arresting suspected robbers.\n\nFilippo Grandi, the United Nations\u2019 High Commissioner for Refugees, separately described interactions with the Taliban as \u201crelatively positive.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Nillan, a 27-year-old resident of Kabul who asked to be identified only by her first name for fear of reprisals, said she did not see a single woman out on the streets during a 15-minute drive, \u201conly men and boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like time has stopped. Everything\u2019s changed,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt feels like our life and our future has ended.\u201d",
