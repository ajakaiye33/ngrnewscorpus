          "title": "Is celebrity fame and political weight same thing?",
          "text": "Clock wise: Anold Schwarzenegger, Mabel Oboh, Yul EDochie, Tonto Dike, Funke Akindele and Banky W.\n\nBy Tony O.\n\nWe have recently endured a tumultuous period in the political world and have been continually bombarded with information to the point that it is difficult to know what to believe.\n\nFame will open doors for celebrities, but there is an exciting and downside part to it. The downside of it is that it mostly likely won\u2019t translate to votes in the political space.\n\nMany would argue that celebrities should not involve themselves in politics simply because entertainers should entertain and leave politics to the \u2018professionals\u2019.\n\nRead Also: I haven\u2019t picked Funke Akindele as deputy, says Jandor, Lagos PDP gov candidate\n\nThat is assuming that celebrities are uneducated about the politics and political arena that they want to play in, and do not know what they are talking about.\n\nThis is an unfair assumption as many celebrities are passionate about the subject and want to see the right changes made. But a celebrity can make the needed electoral impact, when such a celebrity understudy in a political party first before delving into the space.\n\nMabel Oboh is a good example of notable celebrities that got into the space firstly by being ADC\u2019s publicity secretary in Lagos State and worked closely with the party\u2019s national body. She made a remarkable impact in Edo gubernatorial election 2020 by coming fourth position under the umbrella of ADC.\n\nYul Edochie\u2019s political gubernatorial entrance with DPC party was not that of a good example, although he contested and got minimal votes. It could be presumed that he delve into contesting for the governorship position, relying on his fame without much grounding in politics.\n\nThis is why some political parties need to wake up and do what has to be done. Certainly, any party that complements an already weak ticket with a celebrity, thinking it will get the needed electoral value, clearly does not understand how volatile Nigerian voters are.\n\nYes, it will increase the publicity but most likely won\u2019t get the needed electoral value and so cannot translate to victory. A strong political gladiator can comfortably work with a celebrity, but it won\u2019t work if a weak politician in the eye of the electorate, throws a celebrity into the mix.\n\nOn the international scene, we have seen Anold Schwarzenegger, who was governor of California, USA. This is strong character blending with political weight. He is one of many. On the local scene is singer Banky W, actress Tonto Dike, Desmond Elliot and many others.\n\nHow the entertainers-turned politicians are faring is common knowledge. So parties, irrespective of the expected gains, must make people go through the works as party men before handing them tickets.\n\nWith the recent push by political parties handing celebrities tickets instead of its loyalty party members or statesmen, the political parties are derailing and are also moving towards the wrong directions \u2014 certain defeat.\n\nThe question is, is celebrity fame and political fame the same? How does it impact on the electorate? Are some political parties getting it wrong? Only a few will ever get to know how the parties arrive at some policies and/or choices.\n\nTony O., wrote in from Lagos.",

It\u2019s the government that is synonymous with corruption and why they have not been able to change is because they have not changed.\n\n\u201cWhen you change the administration, you just recycle same people, they will not change their behaviour. And the only way to ensure things are different is vote the corrupt people out of office. That\u2019s what we are going to do in 2023,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhen asked if he was ever part of the government he is canvassing to vote out now, Adebayo said his records are open to the public to see, adding that he is part of the young and fresh Nigerians who are fed up with the status quo and wants the narrative changed.\n\n\u201cIn all these years, we have not partaken in the corruption of the government, we have not joined them, we have never supported them, we have not been their bag carrier.\n\n\u201cMany of the people succeeding them today have always been part of the system. We are completely different and we are from the people. Nigerians know that. We know that Nigerians\u2019 problems are man-made.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, as it was designed by nature, Nigeria was not supposed to have problems because every resource you need to develop yourself is there, human capital is also there. Everything you need to succeed is readily available.\n\n\u201cWith all these opportunities, it is unfortunate that the only malice facing the country is bad governance. People know, that is why we are running for office.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with the system from the point of view of those who are in the system. It is only people like me outside the system that knows something is wrong. The whole world can see something is wrong with the country, but they can\u2019t see that, what they see is politics of doubling your money.\n\n\u201cYou come into the government, you support someone to come into the government and you continue to loot the country the more.\n\n\u201cNow the young people, outsiders and third force are coming to together to push a new narrative so as to push an ordinary person into government so that we can then work within to throw out the system, if you don\u2019t, give it a 1,000 years, nothing is going to change.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Adebayo, who is on tour of Washington DC met with a team of policy advisors and diplomats with keen interest in Nigeria led by former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Professor Robert Destro, and deliberated on key common issues of concern between the United States and Nigeria.\n\nThe areas are the security situation in Nigeria as it affects Nigerians in general and aspects impacting on religious freedom in general, poverty and economic problems, access to US policy makers and understanding of making processes within the United States Government, and international and regional alliances Nigeria needs to overcome her present key challenges.\n\nAdebayo emphasised that his administration would overcome most of Nigeria\u2019s protracted security, economic religious freedoms and diplomatic problems with keenness of focus, fair mindedness and robust engagement with the United States.\n\nAdebayo emphasized that his administration would overcome most of Nigeria\u2019s protracted security, economic religious freedoms and diplomatic problems with keenness of focus, fair mindedness and robust engagement with the United States.",

          "text": "By Biodun Busari\n\nAn Irish court, Belfast Crown Court has sentenced a 52-year-old Nigerian man, Rotimi Adeyemo to eight years imprisonment for attacking and accusing girlfriend of causing his erectile dysfunction.\n\nAdeyemo, a father of six, from Carrickdale Gardens in Portadown, who appeared at Belfast Crown Court via a videolink was sentenced by Mr Justice Fowler on Wednesday.\n\nFowler, in his ruling said Adeyemo wrongly accused his ex-partner for casting spell on him, thus attacking her in her residence.\n\nThe judge further said that the undisclosed Adeyemo\u2019s ex-lover sustained attacks which included strangulation, kicks, punches and the use of a knife.\n\nHe said the domestic incident was further aggravated as it was carried out in the presence of the woman\u2019s eight-year old daughter, who begged Adeyemo to stop the attack on her mother.\n\nHe appeared at Belfast Crown Court via a videolink with Maghaberry, where his sentence was divided equally between prison and supervised licence.\n\nAccording to The Irish Times, he was initially charged with attempted murder, which he denied, but later pleaded guilty to a charge of causing grievous bodily harm to his ex-partner with intent.\n\nShe sustained multiple degree of injuries including a collapsed lung, bleeding to the brain and fractures to her ribs, nose and jaw and spent three days in the Royal Victoria Hospital.\n\nThe court heard that prior to the attack, which occurred on August 3rd, 2019, the defendant and the accused had been in a relationship which had ended.\n\nFollowing this break-up, Adeyemo started dating one of the woman\u2019s neighbours which caused rancor between the former couple.\n\nCrown barrister Barra McGrory QC said that two days before the attack, Adeyemo called at his ex\u2019s home and accused her of casting a voodoo spell on him that had affected his potency.\n\nSaying it was the Crown\u2019s case that this was a \u201ckey factor in the offending in terms of motivation\u201d, Mr McGrory said the woman told Adeyemo there was no spell and he should go to see a doctor.\n\nThe report further stated that at 7.15 am on August 3rd, Adeyemo called again at her house and, when he entered, launched an immediate attack which started by him grabbing her by the throat leaving her unable to speak or breathe.\n\nAdeyemo proceeded to carry her by the throat to the kitchen where the attack continued. Threatening to kill her, Adeyemo picked up a knife with his free hand which he used to try to cut her throat.\n\nThe woman fought back in an effort to keep the knife from her throat and was put to the floor where the strangulation continued.\n\nAt this point she managed to grab a plate and smash it over Adeyemo\u2019s head that caused a bleeding wound, which she later told police caused Adeyemo to \u201ccompletely lose it\u201d.\n\nThe attack continued in the back yard and witnessed by the woman\u2019s daughter and neighbours who called the police, adding that the badly injured woman was also punched and kicked in the face, lost consciousness and came round while being tended to by police on her sofa.\n\nThe aftermath of the attack was captured on police body-worn footage and was described as \u201charrowing\u201d by Mr Justice Fowler.\n\nIn this footage, the woman can be seen with serious facial injuries, while Adeyemo was recorded complaining she had put a spell on him to stop his penis working.\n\nWhile the woman was taken to hospital where she treated for multiple injuries, Adeyemo was arrested.\n\nDuring his interview, he told police his ex-partner was into witchcraft, reiterated the claim about the spell and said he drank half a bottle of Baileys before going to her house.\n\nThe judge revealed that the incident had made the woman stop going out and had become isolated, installed security cameras so she could feel safe in her own home and now suffered from nightmares.\n\nSaying the attack occurred in the woman\u2019s home where she should have felt safe and in the presence of a child, Fowler imposed an eight-year sentence and put in place a five-year restraining order.",

The question the world should ask Nigeria military is why bandits and terrorists did operation for more than 4 hours in the country\u2019s capital Nigeria Government and its security agencies did not show up until they finished their attack?\n\n\u201cWe are demanding for the unconditional release of our leader or for him to be transferred to a prison in the South-East. Our leader is not safe in Abuja. The impostor president is aware of what happened in katsina and Kuje prison . The next attack is DSS and their singular target as always will be Biafrans detained in the custody of the DSS and our leader Nnamdi Kanu is detained in the DSS custody.\n\n\u201cDetention of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody has assumed a very dangerous stage, this is in view of the ongoing secret meetings between the security Agencies especially DSS of which one of the outcomes was the mobilization of the bandits for a make-believe attack on DSS facility.\n\n\u201cWe call on the civilised countries in the world especially UK Government, US government, EU, AU, German Government, Israeli government, Russian government, Canadian Government, French government and other reputable human right institutions across the world to prevail on Nigeria Government and her compromised security agencies to release our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from DSS custody unhurt because if anything happens to our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, the story would never remain the same and the consequences is better not imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to let the world know that IPOB members were profiled and detained in Kuje prison yards for simply being persons indigenous to Biafra and of Igbo race. we have their details and want them alive because if anything untoward happens to our comrades who are detained in Kuje, IPOB will never take it easy with Nigeria Government and her security agencies.\n\n\u201cIt is high time to release these innocent folks who were detained illegally and unjustly, Nigeria cannot continue to detain them indefinitely while allowing terrorists and bandits to come and slaughter them under a disguised arrangements by the Buhari-Fulani administration.\n\n\u201cA very pertinent question to ask is: how can bandits and terrorists be rampaging the North, even supposedly attacking president\u2019s convoy and breaking into prison yards to release their colleagues while Buhari and Fulani government deployed and continue to deploy battalion of soldiers to occupy many peaceful communities in Biafraland?\u201d",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has expressed worry over the level politician play up religion and ethnicity in choosing their candidates.\n\nA statement yesterday in Abuja by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, reads: \u201cNorthern Elders\u2019 Forum is deeply concerned over developments in many aspects of our politics as they relate to preparations for the 2023 elections and beyond. These developments threaten our already distressed democratic process.\n\n\u201cOur politics now operates outside safe and tolerable boundaries, and the nation will pay dearly for the desperation and limitations of those who ought to show leadership and responsibility among our politicians.\n\n\u201cIt is not responsible to resist the urge to caution politicians only on the ground that many matters that will impact our lives and the quality of our national existence are purely internal affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cThe search for a running mate for the APC\u2019s presidential candidate with religious faith of two individuals as the sole issue at stake represents a sad reminder that our politicians will not allow our democratic system to grow beyond the narrowest of confinements. Nigerians take their faith seriously, but we are also painfully aware that the faith of our leaders has never been a factor in the manner we are governed.\n\n\u201cThe political manoeuvres in the APC now divert attention from serious issues around the quality of governance, and point to the danger that we are a multi-religious country whose citizens will pay dearly, if one politician is not a Christian or Muslim.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are desperately shepherding Nigerians into two irreconcilable religious divides, all in a bid to garner undeserved advantages at the expense of religious tolerance and co-existence.\n\n\u201cThe melodrama around selection of the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP\u2019s) presidential candidate\u2019s running mate, and the role of Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike will remain constant reminders that power and wealth, irrespective of how they are acquired, have made our political process hostage.\n\n\u201cThe ransom that will be paid to free our democratic process may be such that the nation cannot afford it. Our nation is being carved into strongholds controlled by powerful individual politicians who must be placated at all cost, and we will pay a huge price, if these politicians succeed in stamping their personalities into the democratic process.\u201d\n\nThe forum added: \u201cAmong a handful of other parties with the potential to make a difference, ethnicity and greed are threatening to frustrate the emergence of a nation with the capacity to turn around its fortunes in 2023.\n\n\u201cInstead of exploring options and opportunities that will improve their chances of giving Nigerians real and credible leaders, we only witness frightening levels of hostility and ethnic chauvinism, as we saw recently in exchanges between Labour Party (LP) and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) leaders. Ethnic identity in particular looks capable of being elevated to a point where it alone can cripple a successful transition to 2023 and beyond.\n\n\u201cOur politics has become an additional burden on the Nigerian citizen, even dwarfing the spreading insecurity, poverty and cynicism over the prospects of our survival as one nation. If the way our politicians are seeking power is any indicator for the quality of leadership they will provide, then the nation has a very genuine reason to worry over its future\u2026\u201d",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nAhead of the eid-il-fitri celebration, Sultan of Sokoto and President General, Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, has urged Muslims as well as Nigerian Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia to fast and offer special prayers for God\u2019s intervention for an end to the myriad of challenges facing the country.\n\nThe call is contained in a statement by Khalid Aliyu, JNI secretary general, yesterday, in Kaduna.\n\nThe head of the Islamic community in the country also urged Nigerian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia to pray for Nigeria and its leaders on Arafat day.\n\nHe said with 2023 general elections approaching, there was need to seek Allah\u2019s intervention for stability, security, peace and development of the country.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t humble ourselves to the Almighty Allah, an end to these orgy of violence seems not insight.\n\n\u201cI implore us all to dedicate special prayers against all these menace and the hydra-headed calamities of insecurity, poverty, high cost of living and corruption occurring in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sultan also sought for prayers as the 2023 general election approaches.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, with 2023 general election fast approaching, we need to also seek Allah\u2019s apt intervention for stability, security, peace and development of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs people of faith, we must submit ourselves to Allah, especially that all efforts geared towards restoration of peace and order seems to defy solutions.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate the need for fervent prayers for peaceful and smooth political transition, and an end to the varied socio-economic challenges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Ram sellers, buyers lament\n\nAs Eid-el Kabir is significantly celebrated by slaughtering of rams by Muslim faithful, however, with the current economic downturn, the purchasing power of many to buy rams appear to have been crippled.\n\nA survey in Ibadan, Oyo State, revealed low patronage at different ram markets within the metropolis, thus posing concerns for sellers as well as intending buyers.\n\nBaale of Bodija 30-30 ram market, Chief Rasaki Adeyemo, traced the low sales of rams to the biting economic condition in the country.\n\n\u201cRams are available in almost all the markets and at different places, but buyers who can afford them are scanty.\n\n\u201cThe rams are sold at relatively low prices, but there is obviously no money in people\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cThe willingness to buy rams for Sallah is there. Unfortunately, people are limited by lack of money.\n\n\u201cThis situation is, however, not peculiar to ram sellers alone, as various other businesses are affected by the economic downturn,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, a medium-sized ram sells for between N50,000 and N80,000, while a bigger one sells for between N100,000 and N150,000.\n\nThe northern brown goat (Busoro/Maisoro), he said, would sell for between N20,000 and N30,000.\n\nAdeyemo said the hike in the price of diesel did not help the situation, as it had its effect on the cost of transportation, particularly from the northern part of the country to the south.\n\nHe also identified security challenges, especially on the roads, as another factor contributing to the rising cost of transportation.\n\nAccording to him, the cost of transporting a ram, which used to be N1,000 each is now between N3,000 and N4,000.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of security, many remote northern villages that we buy rams from have been invaded. Therefore, we have to make do with whatever we see nearby,\u201d Adeyemo said.\n\nA ram seller from Zamfara, Mallam Salisu Habibu, said the cost of transportation, which was N400,000 in 2021, had risen to between N800,000 and N1.2 million.\n\nHabibu attributed the situation to poor road network, characterised by bad portions, implored the government to construct lasting roads to ease movement of people and goods.\n\nAnother ram seller at Aleshinloye market, Abdullahi Maigari, said that the N1.2 million cost of bringing down rams in articulated vehicles from the north to the south, used to be between N500,000 and N650,000.\n\nMaigari said unlike the case at hand, about 30 of such vehicles brought in rams to the same Aleshinloye market in 2021.\n\n\u201cThere is no money. We are just sitting down here without sales; buyers are not coming. Depending on what you want in size and your bargaining skill, you will get a ram for between N35,000 and N150,000. The goats go for between N20,000 and N25,000,\u201d he added.\n\nA buyer, Alhaji Monsuru Dauda, not desiring to disclose the cost of the ram he bought, simply said that he had a good deal.\n\nHe, however, decried the economic situation in the country, regretting that it would affect the killing of rams by most Muslims.\n\nAnother ram merchant, Mallam Salisu Aminu from Maiduguri, lamented the loss he had incurred, as his rams were dying due to lack of patronage.\n\nHe also attributed the death of the animal to exhaustion and thirst, occasioned by the long journey from Maiduguri to Ibadan.\n\nAminu said that he had to sell some of the affected rams at give-away prices in order to not lose totally on them.\n\nA bag of rice at Bodija market, which used to sell at N25,000, is now being sold for between N29,000 and N30,000 while a five-litre size of Kings vegetable oil is sold at N7,800, and a 25-litre size for N35,000.\n\n\u2022How to beat high cost of rams \u2013Cleric\n\nHowever,a cleric, Sheikh Abdullahi Nurudeen-Adana, has advised Muslim faithful to come together in two or three and contribute money to buy a cow for sacrifice, to arrest the current high cost of rams in various markets across the country.\n\nNurudeen-Adana who is the Chairman of the lslamic Missionaries Association of Nigeria (lMAN) in llorin, gave the advice.\n\nThe Cleric who described the cost of rams as prohibitive and unaffordable to several Muslims aspiring to perform the sacrifice, recommended buying of vows as best alternatives.\n\nAccording to the cleric, cows that are fairly big and of sound health are fully qualified to be used for the Eid-el-Kabir sacrifice.\n\n\u201cTwo or three muslims can come together to contribute money to buy a fairly big cow that is of sound health for the festival,\u201d Nurudeen-Adana said.\n\nHe warned Muslims against engaging in any negative acts for the slaughtering of rams, stating that it was not compulsory for those who could not afford it.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has said Tuesday\u2019s attack on the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre by terrorists speaks volumes about the failure of the country\u2019s security architecture.\n\nIts President, Ahmad Lawan, stated this when he led a delegation of the leadership of the Senate to assess the level of attack on the correctional facility by insurgents, yesterday.\n\nThe Senate delegation, which also had some members of the Committee on National Security and Intelligence were conducted around the facility by the Comptroller-General of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa.\n\nAccording to the Senate President, an attack on the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre could only have been possible with the collaboration of insiders within the nation\u2019s correctional system.\n\nHe faulted the Nigerian Correctional Service for not providing Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) at the Kuje facility and others across the country.\n\nHe asked the Comptroller-General of the NCS to include a request for the provision of CCTV across maximum and medium correctional centres across the country in its 2023 budget proposal to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nSpeaking after an assessment of the correctional facility, Lawan said: \u201cThe attack on this correctional facility is symptomatic of the failure of security failure. The attack is only a culmination of the failure.\n\n\u201cWe were told that an estimated 300 terrorists attacked this facility. They came on foot, and I believe they should have been detected.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, three hundred people will not come for an operation like this without planning. Planning must have taken a week, a month or a bit more.\n\n\u201cI believe that our security agencies should have picked this from their tracking systems in the FCT.\n\n\u201cSecondly, having gone round the facility itself, we are dissappointed that this facility does not have Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras, something that would record and give you details of what is happening and sometimes record the events.\n\n\u201cThis is a medium security custodial center, how on earth in the FCT facility of this magnitude we don\u2019t have CCTV? It means we can say that all other medium security centers across the country do not have CCTV.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the Comptroller General of Correctional Centre to ensure that the request for CCTV at the maximum and medium custodial centres of the country are included in their 2023 budget because this is essential and indispensable.\n\n\u201cNow, as this facility lacks a functional CCTV, there\u2019s no record of what happened, except narration. But if we had CCTV, at least the records would have been there and analysis made, and arrest will be based on the information from the CCTV.\n\n\u201cThirdly, going from one cell to another to release people, specifically, those that are known to be insurgents, tells a lot of story.\u201cIt may not be far away from an insider job, someone who is either working in this place or must have worked here.\n\n\u201cI think we have to look deeper into what happened, so that we find the culprits, because when things like this happens, then there should be sanctions.\n\n\u201cWhere people fail to do their job properly, and they have been given that responsibility, they should be asked to take responsibility.\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t take responsibility for their failure, then it means nobody would bother to do what is expected of their office or the job that the person has been given.\n\n\u201cHaving this kind of situation today in the FCT, that we have criminals who are free now all over the city is very dangerous and you can never have peace of mind.\n\n\u201cThe FCT has the seat of government, and today that seat is not safe. So, we have to do whatever it takes to get everybody back.\u201d\n\nLawan, therefore, tasked the security agencies to ensure that the insurgents who escaped from the Kuje medium security custodial center are found and brought back.\n\nBriefing the lawmakers earlier, the Commanding Officer of the Nigerian Army Battalion in Gwagwalada, Lieutenant Colonel Adisa, told the Senate Leadership that over 300 insurgents were behind the attack.\n\nAccording to him, only 50 security personnel were on ground when the terrorists armed with IEDs stormed the facility to release the insurgents.",

The structures were marked since April, 2022, and all developers and building owners were served notice to remove such illegal structures.\n\n\u201cThe exercise, which is being carried out by a joint government task force, commenced from Bida Road, by Modebe Avenue, Fegge Onitsha. The affected buildings include Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention Deliverance Ministries, shops and other perimeter fences.\n\n\u201cThe structures were marked since April 2022 and all developers and building owners were served notice to remove such illegal structures,\u201dAburime stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the demolition of the church of controversial prophet Odumeje has continued to generate reactions.\n\nAlthough the main building of the church, Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention Ministry World Miracle Centre, Alias Land of Freedom, located at Bida Road, Fegge, Onitsha, was not affected, the security post and another building attached to the church were demolished.\n\nThere was drama when the joint task force stormed the church premises for the demolition as the owner of the church, Prophet Odumeje, wanted to stop the task force from carrying out the exercise, but the security agents pushed and rough-handled him before carrying out the demolition.\n\nThe security guard at the church, who gave his name as Eze, told Daily Sun that the main church was not demolished, as was trending in social media, but a house used as security post of the church and other structures along the bank of the stream were brought down.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe house in question is not even built by the church, though the house is at the front of the church, built by the government in the \u201870s as a police post. We are only using the house as a security post and parking store. So, as you can see, the church is intact, nothing happened to the church as rumoured. Government should leave Odumeje and his church alone and face other challenges.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, trader along the Bida road, Mr. Johnson Obika, commended the state government by backing their threat with action, saying that the security post of the church was built on the drainage system.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a welcome development, it will help free flow of water when it rains. There are other structures that need to be demolished to clean the drainages. For how long shall we continue to live like this, the right thing should be done and Soludo has started the clean-up of Onitsha.\u201d\n\nA member of the church, Mrs. Veronica Nwatu, condemned the action of the state government, wondering why it singled the church out for demolition, among many structures in Onitsha.\n\n\u201cWhy is it targeted at Odumeje church; it is out of envy and jealousy. Have they finished rehabilitating all the bad roads in Onitsha? Is our church the only structure along this axis? Why are they after Odumeje? Is it because he is doing good and helping people? Nobody shall stop Odumeje\u2019s ministry,\u201d she lamented.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThere are strong indications that this year\u2019s Muslim Sallah celebration may be blighted by acute fuel scarcity, insecurity and the astronmic cost of rams across many states of the country.\n\nWith fewer filling stations dispensing fuel across Lagos metropolis and neighbouring states in the SouthWest for instance, commuters are already lamenting a sharp increase in the cost of interstate transportation services which is some cases have exceeded the 35 per cent mark.\n\nSome transport operators who spoke to Daily Sun in separate interviews lamented the high cost of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol.\n\nA transporter at Pen- Cinema in Agege who shuttles Lagos to Ibadan said they had to increase transport fare to N4,000 from N 2,500 in order to break even having bought product from black market vendors to petrol at the cost of N200 per litre.\n\nThe situation was the same at Iyana-Ipaja and Berger Motor parks where transport fare have equally increased.\n\nA commuter at the Pen-Cinema motor park who identified himself as Shakrullah Adesina, said he came to enquire about transportation fare for his family, in their Ibadan country home, said he may be forced to celebrate Sallah in Lagos due to the escalating fares.\n\n\u2018\u2018To transport myself and five members of my family will be too much a burden on me. I don\u2019t think I have such resources to spend on transportation alone not to talk of feeding while in Ibadan. If they are charging this much for a one-way trip, what will happen on my return leg?\n\nAnother commuter at the popular Berger motor park, Kazeem Olabiyi, said he and members of his family may foreclose plans to travel to Osogbo, Osun State, unless the state government declares a free train ride from Lagos.\n\nHe explained that he has enjoyed the free train ride in past years from Lagos to Osogbo, adding there are rumors that the free ride may be cancelled this year, hence his reason to explore travel ling by bus which has now become a day dream with rising transportation fares.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of rams across various markets have skyrocketed as sellers lamented about low patronage. At the popular Kara ram market, a medium seized ram which sold for N100, 000 last year now costs about N150,000 while large sizes cost between N200,000 and N300,000. The situation was not different at the Meiran and Mangoro ram markets.\n\nSome buyers who spoke to Daily Sun said they are at crossroads because the cost of the animal alone has gulped over 70 per cent of their budget for Sallah celebration.\n\nA buyer at the Meiran ram market, Mr. Sule Ajadi, said he had planned to buy two rams with a budget of N200,000, but said he may end up with one because of the cost.\n\nFor his part, a popular ram seller at Kara market, Alhaji Yisa Kabiru, blamed the high cost of diesel for the high cost of rams. He said transporters of ram from various parts of the North have increased what they hitherto charged for transportation cost. He added that the number of security checkpoints have equally increased, stressing that these checkpoints are mounted to extort drivers.",

However the penalty was saved by the goalkeeper with Sodje Stephen converting a rebound to give the host the early lead.\n\nMore pressure from Insurance led to an own goal by Gateway in the 30th minute with Saraki slotting in from close range the third goal in the 34th minute.\n\nThe first half ended with Insurance having three goals advantage.\n\nEcheter Deputy got the fourth goal for Bendel Insurance in the 78th minute from outside the 22m box.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the victory, Edo State Acting Governor, Philip Shaibu expressed joy over the win. \u201c We have opened a gap on top of the table that can take us to NPFL. I am happy that all the efforts we have been putting in are yielding results. Technically, we are there (in NPFL) already and that is what Edo people have been waiting for.\n\n\u201cBendel Insurance actually do no belong to NNL, and we are happy we are going to join our mates (in terms of football) like Rangers and Kano Pillars. I am so excited and happy with this development,\u201d concluded the acting governor.\n\nOn future plans when Bendel Insurance eventually qualify to play in the NPFL, Shaibu noted that \u201cour players are good and good enough for the NPFL. Our target is to be the factory that produce players for the country. And you can see today, four of our Bendel Insurance feeder team players featured in this match.\u201d",

          "title": "Sunday Dare\u2019s Monumental Disaster As Sports Minister (Part 1), By Sylvanus Ofekun",
          "text": "It is now an open secret that the reign of Mr. Sunday Akin Dare (SAD), as Minister of Sports is a monumental disaster, a miserable adventure and an embarrassment to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He has successfully sunk the country\u2019s sports sector to an unimaginable depth of despair, as against the little hope of optimism the sector hinged on before his appointment.\n\nDare has been a meddlesome interloper, a skillful sleeky dribbler and a higgledy \u2013piggledy fellow with a racketeering mindset. The highly venerated office of a Minister is being treated with disdain, no thanks to SAD\u2019s pettiness and incompetency. Twitter just did the needful, by removing the blue badge attached to his handle, because of his numerous blunders that negate the core values of the microblogging site.\n\nHis tactics is to woo individuals with contrary views, and if they fail to capitulate, he then employs legal threats. Infact, his hands are blessed with transmittable failure to anything he comes across; from the National Sports Festival, Olympics in Tokyo and other crisis rocking some sports federations are traceable to SAD.\n\nDare started his administrative malfeasance with the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) in 2019, and then stretched his hands toward the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) in 2021; currently he is having a stopover at the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Certainly, any encounter with SAD ends with endless crisis and sadness.\n\nIn October 2019, less than 2 months in office, SAD ordered the sack of the former Technical Director of the AFN, Mr. Sunday Adeleye, citing poor performance of team Nigeria at the World Athletics Championships, held in Doha in September 2019. His directive was contained in a letter addressed to the President of the AFN, Engr. Shehu Ibrahim Gusau. A directive that he lacks the power to give (only the AFN Congress has such powers).\n\n\u201cConsequent on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, I am further directed to convey the directive of the Honourable Minister for the immediate removal from office of Mr. Sunday Adeleye as Technical Director of the AFN on account of ascertained gross misconduct.\u201d Dare\u2019s directive reads.\n\nEngr.Gusau\u2019s stance that the right thing should be done led to his persecution, as SAD employed various 'guerilla tactics' in an attempt to bring down an innocent man. The Minister did set up a parallel AFN, and disregarded the constitutionally recognized AFN board, despite two concurrent courts judgments.\n\nUnfortnately, his action led to the disqualification of 10 Nigerian athletes for missing the three (3) compulsory Out of Competition Testing (OCT), as Mr. Sunday Akin Dare had been earlier notified about the consequences of not carrying out three out-of-competition Doping tests on all athletes competing at the Olympics level, eight months before the ban. The Ibrahim Gusau-led board drew the Ministry\u2019s attention to Rule 15 of the Atheletics Integrity Unit (AIU) which classified Nigeria as a Category A Federation, but the minister turned a deaf ear to the warning bell in a bid to override and intimidate Gusau.\n\nJust before the 2021 Olympics, Mr. Sunday Akin Dare dissolved federation boards before expiration of their tenure, and then created a 3 man Caretaker Committee in each federation (an aberration). The Minister failed to explain the reason behind the dessolution. Although, some alleged that sole reason for the dissolution was to gain control of Olympic funds. This singular action of his, gave birth to the present day crisis in Basketball, because he created legal grounds for those who were not in sync with NBBF constitution.\n\nAgain, before the departure of the women\u2019s basketball team DTigress to Tokyo, the former Team Manager Mactabene Amacheree had called out the sports Ministry for failing to pay them their entitlements for winning the women\u2019s Afrobasket in 2017. It started like a rant but Ms Amacheree insisted that since the Minister had claimed that money owed basketball has been paid to the federation; this was the genesis of D\u2019Tigress protests video that went viral late last year.\n\nDespite not being paid their full entitlements, D\u2019Tigress in early 2022 went to the World Cup Qualifiers in Serbia, and picked Africa's sole ticket. The 3 Peats obeyed the clarion to serve their fatherland with a condition to reject AFA Sport Kitt, as the deal is currently under investigation by anti graft agencies (it is alleged that the sports minister benefitted from the deal). Few months before the World cup, the Sports Ministry announced the withdrawal of Nigeria from international Basketball for two years on the orders of President Muhammadu Buhari, citing some elements whose tactics was to use the Federation of International Basketball Association (FIBA) to bully Nigeria. Again, this was globally condemned, but the Minister went ahead to inaugurate an Interim Management Committee (IMC), saddled with the responsibilities to oversee basketball in Nigeria. Then, FIBA announced that it has replaced Nigeria with Mali following the inability of Nigeria to confirm that it will participate at the World Cup in Sidney, Austrilia. Days later, the Ministry made a U turn and announced a return to international basketball.\n\nThis state of confusion by the Sports Ministry was viewed by many as a personal vendetta against the D'Tigress, whose sin was their last year's outburst. Others, questioned the sincerity of the sports ministry in dealing with the crisis in basketball, after the fortunes he made from the game.\n\nIn his reaction, the immediate past minister of sports, Barr. Solomon Dalung said the action of his successor against D'Tigress was just a vendetta, as he queried why Dare has not paid the ladies despite the release of funds for that purpose .\n\n\"The girls are being punished today for being patriotic. These are young girls that Nigeria did not invest a dime on. Their parents live out of this country. But out of sheer love and patriotism, they sacrificed to try to rebuild the image of this country and this is how their future has been ruined. I will agree with those speculating the Minister (Dare) is on a vendetta for the girls exposing the crises of honesty rocking the issue of their money which was applied and approval gotten by me.\" Dalung stated.\n\nThe former beret wearing Minister has consistently asked Dare to be bold, come clean and explain to the ladies (D\u2019Tigress) the reason for not paying them in full, despite the release of two billion naira for that purpose.\n\nOnly recently, the Minister recruited some mediators to plead with some adversaries, especially those who petitioned him to anti graft agencies. For those who are unware, the Minister has plenty of cases at the anti graft agencies, with some cases dating back before he became Minister as one of his aide was detained for 6 days. Unfortunately for SAD, this aide of his, has left him out of anger.\n\nIn football, Nigerians should know that SAD was solely responsible for Nigeria not picking the 2022 world ticket; he ensured that Gernot Rohr was fired as the Technical Adviser of the Super Eagles; as this was against the wish of the Nigeria Football Federation, and also, forced the clash between the Super Eagles of Nigeria and the Blacks Stars of Ghana to be played at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja, because he wants to make a political statement.\n\nMore details in part 2\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n[email protected]",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

This is evident from the feeders from our foot soldiers and members, signifying strongly that the ongoing INEC registration exercise in the country is not being pursued vigorously in the district.\n\n\u201cThe statistical distribution across the six local government areas of the district reveals that the data from the district is deplorably disproportionate relative to other districts in the state. Our findings reveal that there are not enough registration centres, INEC registration machines and personnel available in the district, thereby limiting access for potential voters to register.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis scenario portends both disenfranchisement of Edo North voters willing to vote in the 2023 general elections and undermining their electoral rights. The leadership and members of NOCSON as well as other stakeholders are by this press conference calling on the Chairman of INEC and particularly the Resident Electoral Commissioner of Edo State to, as a matter of urgency, activate the process of registering more eligible voters,\u201d he charged.\n\nThe group called for increase in the number of registration centres across the six LGAs in the district, including Etsako East, Etsako West, Etsako Central, Owan West, Owan East and Akoko Edo LGAs; provision of more data capturing machines to cover the six LGAs and deployment of enough personnel to man the eventual machines to be deployed to the various centres.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Our students are in tiers, demoralised, confused and frustrated with little or no hope for the future.\n\n\u201cCMPG calls on all well meaning Nigerians and the international community to prevail on President Buhari and APC national government to have mercy on the helpless and frustrated millions of Nigerian students by adopting the credible UTAS payment system, and to also sign agreement reached with ASUU.\n\n\u201cThe coalition noted that Buhari administration failed the nation woefully in all aspects of her national life including; education and health sectors, weak economy, huge foreign indebtedness, insecurity, alleged disunity known as Fulani agenda, corruption, poverty, joblessness, weak infrastructure development, rapid inflation, hunger, et al, from 2015 and counting.\n\n\u201cIf he truly cares for the future of millions of young Nigerian students, President Buhari must immediately do everything within his powers to ensure that ASUU agreement with the federal government is signed urgently and UTAS payment system adopted within the next couple of days, so that University students can resume classes throughout the country,\u201d CMPG said.\n\nThe highlight of the July meeting was the vote of confidence passed on the governor of Delta State and Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Senator Dr Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, over his good governance strides and centrality of morals in the chess game of political power.\n\nCMPG described Okowa as a visionary leader, a great patriot, a super technocrat, peace ambassador and excellent manager of public resources, who will add great values to nation building and national government in the next dispensation, beginning from May 29, 2023.\n\n\u201cThe coalition strongly believe that the end of the abysmal performance of Buhari and APC national government in 2023, shall bring about the sudden rise of Nigeria, to take her rightful place in the global stage as the giant of Africa, via the Atiku/Okowa ticket,\u201d CMPG said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Capital market stakeholders have commended NGX for providing a vibrant listing platform for government and corporates to meet their business objectives. This was stated during the NGX CEO Roundtable held on Thursday, 7 July 2022.\n\nThe event, themed, \u201cCreating the Enabling Ecosystem for Accessing Capital from the Nigerian Capital Markets\u201d brought together key stakeholders in the capital market ecosystem to address and proffer solutions to the challenges faced by issuers in raising capital in the market.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Chairman, Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), Mr. Abubakar Mahmoud, SAN, OON, said that \u201cwe convened this Roundtable with the ultimate objective of enhancing the listing experience for listed companies and providing useful insights to prospective companies. NGX, as Nigeria\u2019s premier securities exchange, remains strategically positioned to support the aspirations of its stakeholders and the Nigerian economy as a whole and we believe the deliberations from the panel sessions will help us improve our operations and offerings in listings experience, market development, advocacy, and investment opportunities.\u201d\n\nGiving the keynote speech, Honourable Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment, HE, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo said that the Federal government is working diligently to improve the economy through diversifying the economy and strengthening institutions and structures. Additionally, he said, \u201cas more of our startup companies grow and mature, we must ensure that there is access to a range of financial options to support their expansion plans.\u201d\n\nHonourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. (Mrs) Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed in a goodwill message, said that as a nation faced with the burden of economic recovery as a result of the global pandemic, the capital market is an efficient, reliable solution for businesses to raise capital and for investors to grow wealth. Ahmed who was represented by the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Finance, Alhaji Aliyu Ahmed, said the theme of the roundtable is apt and will contribute to providing a deep, liquid and, integrated capital market which will deepen the alternative sources of finance and boost investors\u2019 confidence to invest long term in the capital market.\n\nOn his part, the Director General, Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Lamido Yuguda noted that the theme of the roundtable resonates with the mandate of the Securities and Exchange Commission in developing and regulating the market while protecting investors. \u201cThe Commission welcomes the sound initiatives of NGX as it continues to engage with experts on for changes that will lead to a more desired expansion of the market\u201d, he added.\n\nMr. Temi Popoola, CEO, Nigerian Exchange Limited reassured stakeholders of NGX\u2019s commitments to improving issuers\u2019 experience by providing a platform that enables companies to raise capital more efficiently whilst protecting investors. \u201cAs part of efforts to improve the listing experience of current issuers and attract new listings, NGX has intensified efforts with policymakers to shape reforms and policies that are supportive of listings and the capital market at large. We are strengthening the value proposition for corporates to consider the capital markets as a platform for raising capital and working to ensure we are competitive when compared to options that are available to issuers. We are, therefore, actively involved in contributing to policy formulation and advocacy to ensure an enabling environment for listings, including, working with several stakeholders to ensure that the time to market and the costs for listing are optimized.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the benefits derived from listing on the Exchange, CEO MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, Mr. Karl Toriola, noted that MTN has received incredible support from NGX in its listing journey, which has enabled the brand to deepen and diversify its shareholder base. He mentioned that NGX\u2019s corporate governance requirements and strong guidance provide credibility around the capital market and grant access to the wider public. He further explained that MTN Nigeria\u2019s recent public offer launched on the Exchange saw about 78% percent of women subscriptions with 80% under the age of forty-one which shows the drive for financial inclusivity.\n\nFurthermore, CEO, BUA Foods Plc, Engr Ayodele Abioye, said that listing on the Exchange allows for democratization and public participation which has enhanced the credibility of the BUA brand. \u201cListing on NGX presents opportunities for companies to raise capital, fund business growth and implement expansion plans. In the first few weeks of our listing our shares valued at N18bn on the Exchange, increased by 66%. As our share prices continue to stabilize, our shareholder base has grown by about 400% since listing on the Exchange and we are beginning to see investors\u2019 confidence in our business\u201d, he added.\n\nOn the improvement opportunities in the listing process, speakers at the roundtable argued that there is a need to shorten the time to market and reduce the cost of transactions. Sharing optimism for the future of the capital market, it was also noted that the regulatory process has improved over the past decades with significant progress under the current administration.\n\nPanellists at the roundtable include Karl Toriola, CEO, MTN Communications Nigeria Plc; Engr Ayodele Abioye, CEO, BUA Foods Plc; Owen Omogiafo, President/GCEO, Transnational Corporation Plc; Ike Chioke, GMD, Afrinvest (West Africa) Limited & President of Association of Issuing Houses of Nigeria; Abbas Abdulkadir, Head, Registration, Exchanges & Market Infrastructure & Innovation, Securities & Exchange Commission; Asue Ighodalo, Founding Partner, Banwo & Ighodalo and Chairman, Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG); Funso Akere, CEO, Stanbic IBTC Capital; Haruna Jalo-Waziri, CEO, Central Securities Clearing System Plc; Selloua Chakri, Managing Director of SCL Advisory Limited; Ogho Okiti, Managing Director, BusinessDay and Jude Chiemeka, Divisional Head, Capital Markets, NGX.\n\nNGX CEO Roundtable is a platform that ensures continuous dialogue with key stakeholders and provides strategic solutions to economic issues for follow-up implementation by The Exchange in its capital market advocacy role.",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations. May the good Lord bless all of you and the work that you do\u201d added Jime.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economic Diversification: Value addition in solid minerals sector will spur industrialization- DG NSRMEA",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

More than 400 of them have been brought in and more are still coming.\u201d\n\nFasure disclosed that the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has been briefed on the full scale armed invasion of the medium security correctional facility in Kuje, Abuja, by gunmen late Tuesday, in which some of the inmates escaped.\n\nHe recalled that the security officers on duty fiercely engaged them and inflicted a heavy casualty on them, but regrettably, given their unprecedented number, they overpowered the officers on duty. One of the security personnel that engaged the attackers was unfortunately killed.\n\nHe noted that preliminary investigation has indicated that the Boko Haram sect may have been responsible for the attack, adding that the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), in conjunction with other security agencies, are working to bring back in the escaped inmates.\n\nHe said after the Abolongo, Oyo State, attack on a correctional facility, in October last year, it became apparent that a new form of attack for which our system was not prepared for had emerged. Our system was primed to prevent and foil internal disturbance and riots, not external attacks/invasion, since the facilities were usually built around police and military formations.\n\nHe noted that the minister then directed that the NCoS urgently work with other security agencies to fortify all correctional centres in the country and insulate them against future attacks, among other measures introduced.\n\nHe said this was carried out, as well armed soldiers, police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officers were drafted to our facilities nationwide, to secure them against further attacks. Several but unsuccessful attempts were made to attack our facilities since then, as the armed guards repelled them on each occasion.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe appeal to all residents to be calm but vigilant. Security is a collective work between government and the citizens. Kindly therefore report all suspicious individuals and activities to the nearest security agency around you. We appeal also to doctors and medical workers to treat and then immediately report anyone with gunshot wounds to the law enforcement agency.\n\nHe revealed that the Minister has directed that all correctional facilities in the country be fortified; that all personnel be vigilant and alert, to avoid recurrence.\n\nThe Minister has also directed that full investigation into the incident be carried out and he should be briefed as soon as possible. If any complicity is established, the Minister has promised that appropriate actions would be taken.\n\nMichael Olugbode",
