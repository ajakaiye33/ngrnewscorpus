          "text": "Nollywood actress, Victoria Kolawole, has lamented her experience with a \u2018fan\u2019 who defrauded her at a filling station after promising to assist her in purchasing fuel.\n\nKolawole took to her Instagram page on Thursday to express her dissatisfaction with the country\u2019s current fuel shortage.\n\n\u201cI need fuel. I\u2019m frustrated, \u201cshe wrote with crying emojis.\n\nKolawole claimed she had entrusted her money to an \u201cinnocent-looking\u201d fan who promised to assist her in purchasing fuel.\n\nHowever, the said fan neither assisted her in making the purchase nor returned her money.\n\n\u201cSo I went to the filling station today, but there was too much queue so I couldn\u2019t get down from the car. Luckily for me, I saw this innocent-looking guy, he came to me and said he\u2019s my fan.\n\n\u201cHe promised to help me get the fuel, so I gave him money and my keg, and still gave him extra money. Till now I have not seen the guy or the fuel,\u201d she wrote.\n\nKolawole\u2019s frustration was shared by several Nigerians across the country who continued to spend hours in long queues to fuel their cars and appliances.\n\nAs earlier reported by The PUNCH, the scarcity, which has lasted more than three weeks, was caused by the withdrawal of the methanol-blended petrol, imported into Nigeria in January.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We also want to make Lagos the most impressive job creation centre nationwide.\n\n\u201dWe will try and double whatever it is that we are looking at so we want to challenge you with a lot more. We believe you have the capacity because you have demonstrated this in the last four years that given the opportunity, you can double these numbers.\n\n\u201dIt is only by scaling those numbers that we can reduce the percentage of unemployment that we are seeing.\n\n\u201dWe will give you the grants that you need, we will give the funding that you need to ensure that you can double it up, you can create the eco-space and the ability for you to be able to touch a lot more people quicker, faster and deeper,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor pledged to incorporate outcomes of the summit into the implementation of the State\u2019s governing agenda.\n\nAlso speaking, Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Mr. Sam Egube, said the unemployment rate in the state was fuelled by urban migration from other states and other nations into Lagos for opportunities, hope, and dreams of a better life.\n\nEgube said the state remained the most populous state in Nigeria, with a population growth rate conservatively put at 3.2 percent per annum driven very heavily by urban migration.\n\n\u201dA high percentage of the migrants come with only their bags and bodies, unskilled and without a job and many without a proper place to stay.\n\n\u201dIt is for this reason and the general state of the national and global economy that the unemployment rate in the state stands at 37.3 percent, with youth unemployment at about 42.5 percent.\n\n\u201dResolving these challenges on a sustainable basis requires deep thinking, collaboration, and consultation with stakeholders to evolve ideas, policies, and initiatives, which when acted upon, should see us through,\u201d he said.\n\nLSETF Executive Secretary, Ms. Teju Abisoye, disclosed that 45 percent of the skilled labour force in the country was concentrated in Lagos, said participants at the summit would identify new trends and opportunities in diverse sectors and value chains that needed to be prioritised with the right investment.\n\nReeling out the impacts recorded by the agency in the last five years, Abisoye said LSETF, through its interventions, had created over 182,000 direct and indirect jobs in Lagos. She added that the agency had saved 50,000 direct jobs through support and business stimulation.\n\nShe said 12,335 young persons were trained in modern skills, 413 tech start-ups supported through soft financing, while 68,582 new taxpayers were added into the tax net of the state.\n\nThe Board Chairperson, LSETF, Mrs. Bola Adesola, said the surge in crime and the resultant insecurity challenges due to the lack of jobs and gainful engagement of the youths, had revealed that collective prosperity as a state and a nation depended on how sustainably jobs could be created.\n\nAdesola said it was also imperative to note that the never-ending duty of job creation required all public and private stakeholders to actively collaborate, design, and develop resilient policies and strategies.",

Umahi\u2019s leadership acumen, Chief Clark emphasized that it was the turn of core Igbo to produce the next President of Nigeria even as he blessed Governor David Umahi\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\nREAD ALSO:APC-led FG makes promises, but Nigerians get failure \u2014 Wike\n\n\u201cWhen I say I want a president of Nigeria of Igbo extraction, I do not mean someone from Delta or Rivers State or anywhere else. I mean a pure southeast Igbo President.\n\n\u201cMy preferred choice is Igbo. So, my son, I have heard you. I have prayed for you, whatever you deserve, God will grant it to you.\n\n\u201cWhen you defected to APC, I asked why, we all are fighting this cause but if the PDP we served 100% abandoned the Igbo, then we all will abandon the PDP. I have told them already.\u201d\n\nHe commended Governor Umahi for the infrastructural accomplishments in Ebonyi State and prayed God to grant his ambition the needed fulfillment.\n\n\u201cI have heard about the good works you are doing in Ebonyi State, God will guide you and protect you. What you will become, only God can decide and no human being can change it. God will give you the courage, the wisdom, the determination to become what God desires you to be.\n\n\u201cYou have all the qualities and God will protect you and grant you the grace to achieve all your desires in good health and long life.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Governor Umahi thanked the elder statesman for his blessings and assured him that he would turn around the fortunes of Nigeria if given the opportunity to pilot the affairs of the country.\n\n\u201cI believe that if God shows mercy to this country, he will not bring up a pure professional politician to be the President of Nigeria.\n\nNigeria needs a bit of a business-minded person who also has gone through our nature of politics and Nigeria needs someone who can engage very properly. Without engagement, without finding what are the people\u2019s problems, why do you do what you are doing and without fairness, equity, and justice, it will be very difficult for our country to unite\u201d.\n\nGovernor Umahi said his ambition is in the hands of God and only Him would ensure he emerges victorious at next year\u2019s polls.\n\n\u201cWhat we do not know is that both good leaders and bad leaders all come from God. When God is happy with the people, He brings good leaders to them but when He is angry with the people, He gives them bad leaders. So, when people castigate leaders, it is God they are castigating.We should turn our eyes unto God so that he will show mercy on us.\u201d",

          "text": "By Gbade Ogunwale and Okodili Ndidi, Abuja\n\nThere is security threat, says PDP\n\nPolitical spending pushes up demand for dollar\n\nInsecurity and neutrality of security agencies are key factors that will shape next year\u2019s general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said yesterday.\n\nThe election umpire is concerned that millions, especially Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), may be disenfranchised unless threats are neutralised.\n\nTerrorism and banditry have displaced many people in the Northeast, Northwest and Northcentral.\n\nMany people are living in IDP camps and others have fled their homes and communities.\n\nThe United State Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, said the attention of the world will be on Nigeria ahead of and during the polls.\n\nThe European Union Election Observation Mission to Nigeria, which visited PDP chairman Dr. Iyorchia Ayu at the party secretariat in Abuja, said it would take steps to ensure that concerns raised by the main opposition party are addressed.\n\nINEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye and Leonard spoke at a town hall meeting hosted by the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE).\n\nIt was organised with support from U.S. Embassy in Nigeria, with the theme: \u201cAgenda setting for sustainable democratic culture.\u201d\n\nOkoye believes that despite the new Electoral Act, next year\u2019s elections will be faced with challenges.\n\nOn how insecurity will affect the polls, he said: \u201cSo many of the IDPs are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs).\n\n\u201cIt is next to an impossibility to recreate their constituencies and polling units.\n\n\u201cGrowing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of IDPs will pose challenges.\n\n\u201cThis is because Section 47(1) of the Electoral Act provides that a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter card to a presiding officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\n\n\u201cSome of these persons are no longer in their constituencies and can no longer access their polling units and so many of them have lost their PVCs.\n\n\u201cWhile it is easy to recreate constituencies and polling units in clustered IDP camp, it is next to an impossibility to do so for persons staying in scattered locations.\u201d\n\nHe said INEC would surmount the challenge by printing new PVCs for IDPs and recreating their polling units in their camps to enable them to vote, depending on proximity to their state and federal constituencies.\n\nThis, he said, is in accord with Section 24(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides: \u201cIn the event of an emergency affecting an election, the Commission shall, as far as practicable, ensure that persons displaced as a result of the emergency are not disenfranchised.\u201d\n\nOkoye said Commission was at the terminal phase of its Continuous Voters Registration (CVR), adding that insecurity was a factor in getting more Nigerians to register.\n\n\u201cThere are so many communities that are still inaccessible to our registration officers.\n\n\u201cIn the next few weeks, the Commission will roll out modalities for the further devolution and rotation of the CVR to our registration areas and the security of our personnel and the registrants are fundamental to the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to register all eligible registrants but will not expose our staff to unnecessary danger. We will roll out and roll back depending on the security situation in different parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye believes that successful general elections will depend on how quickly security agencies \u201cdegrade if not neutralise the security threats and challenges in different parts of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cVoting and the exercise of democratic mandate may not be the priority of persons enveloped in a climate and atmosphere of fear and anxiety,\u201d the INEC commissioner said.\n\nOkoye urged the media to continue to highlight the possible solutions to the security challenges and to hold the government accountable.\n\nHe was of the view that the media has a critical role in safeguarding the electoral process.\n\nOur concerns, by PDP\n\nDr Ayu said PDP had misgivings about the neutrality of the security agencies, going by their actions in previous elections.\n\nAddressing the EU delegation, he accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) government of weakening the democratic process and institutions and manipulating agencies that ought to be neutral.\n\nAyu said: \u201cWe have consistently worked hard as a broad-based political party, mobilised people, not just to canvass for votes, but to ensure that we defend the votes against any anti-democratic tendencies.\n\n\u201cIn spite of willingly handing over to the current ruling party in 2015, we have seen a decline in those values which we promoted as a political party, including the establishment and creation of certain institutions that were meant to strengthen democracy in this country.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are very worried that instead of strengthening the democratic process to serve the people of this country, we are seeing a sustained decline in those democratic processes in the conduct of elections and use of security services to attack judges and other citizens, instead of protecting them and preserving the electoral process.\n\n\u201cYou have the 2019 election report, which you have read. It showed clearly some of those problems that we are complaining about and which we will keep complaining about as long as these practices are sustained.\n\n\u201cWe believe that justice was not done in the 2019 election.\n\n\u201cNow that we are moving towards another election in 2023, it\u2019s very important that we stress the need for the electoral umpire to be genuinely independent.\u201d\n\nAyu urged the EU election observer team to take special interest in the upcoming governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun states.\n\nHead of the EU delegation, Ms. Maria Arena, said the team made 30 recommendations in its 2019 general election report.\n\nAccording to her, the visit to the PDP leadership was part of a follow-up process to assess how the recommendations have been taken on board by different authorities in Nigeria.\n\nArena said the delegation would meet with as many stakeholders as possible, including the civil society, the media, the government and other parties.\n\n\u2018All eyes on Nigeria\u2019\n\nLeonard said the eyes of the world will be on Nigeria this year and early next year as the country prepares to choose new leaders.\n\nShe said the NGE had the responsibility of promoting democracy.\n\n\u201cYour leaders have been consistent in calling for the respect of presidential term limits, for example, and they have been quick to condemn military coups in West Africa and the rest of the continent,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Ambassador said beyond public pledges supporting freedom and democracy, the editors and members of the civil society groups must delve deeper into underlying factors that erode faith in democracy.\n\nShe explained that patronage politics, corruption, inequality, and the failure of many democratic governments to deliver for their citizens fuel public and media doubts about the democratic model, causing them to lose hope and cynically accept the status quo as inevitable and normal.\n\nLeonard said: \u201cOne way to restore public confidence in democracy is through free and fair elections.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world will, therefore, be on Nigeria this year and early next year as you prepare to choose a new president and transition to a new government.\n\n\u201cWe were pleased that last week President Muhammadu Buhari signed Nigeria\u2019s long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law, ensuring adoption of a number of long-sought-after reforms to the electoral process, including the electronic transmission of election results from polling places.\n\nNGE President, Mustapha Isah, underscored the constitutional role of the media in Section 22, noting that \u201call aspects of good governance are facilitated by a strong and independent media\u201d.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government yesterday began the extradition process of suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari to the United States of America (USA), over $1.1 million alleged wire fraud involving Abas Roman, popularly known as Hushpuppi and four others.\n\nKyari, who was the Commander of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), is currently cooling his heels in the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency(NDLEA), over some fraudulent drug deals.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe application for his extradition marked FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022, was filed before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho, by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nIt was brought under the Extradition Act, following a request by the Diplomatic Respresentative of the U.S Embassy in Abuja for \u201cthe surrender of Abba Kyari, whom is a subject in a superseding three count indictment.\n\nMalami has expressed satisfaction that the offence in respect of which Kyari\u2019s surrender is not political nor is it trivial.\n\nIn April 2021, a jury filed an indictment against Kyari with the approval of the U.S. District Court and demanded Kyari stand trial for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft.\n\nConsequently, the US Embassy requested for Kyari\u2019s extradition saying, \u201cOn April 29, 2021, based on the indictment filed by the grand jury and with the approval of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, a deputy clerk of the court issued a warrant of arrest for Kyari.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cThe arrest warrant remains valid and executable to apprehend Kyari for the crimes with which he is charged in the indictment. Kyari is wanted to stand trial in the United States for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, and identity theft. Kyari is the subject of an indictment in case Number 2:21-cr-00203 (also referred to as 2:21-MJ-00760 and 2:21-CR-00203-RGK), filed April 29, 2021, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\u201d\n\nKyari was accused of conspiring with a United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based Nigerian, Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi to commit the crime.\n\nThe charges against Kyari reads, \u201cCount one: Conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1349, carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years;\n\n\u201cCount two: Conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of Title 18, United States Code Section 1956(h), carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. Count three: Aggravated identity theft, and aiding and abetting that offence, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1028A(a)(1) and 2(a), carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of two years.\u201d\n\n(Continued on www.sunnewsonline.com)\n\nMeanwhile, Malami said he was satisfied that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nHe said Kyari, \u201cif surrendered, will not be prejudiced at his trial and will not be punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty, by reason of his race, nationality or political opinions\u201d.\n\nThe AGF said having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it will not be unjust or oppressive, or be too severe a punishment, to surrender him.\n\nMalami said he was also satisfied that Kyari has been accused of the offence for which his surrender is sought.\n\nHe noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nAccording to the AGF, \u201cAs you are aware extradition is a process that involves multifaceted components. The components are usually multi-territorial; international, local and judicial.\n\n\u201c Submision of request from the concern party to the relevant authorities constitutes one of such components. The Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice received the extradition request in respect of the officer in question.\n\n\u201cAfter thorough studies and reviews of issues regarding the application and components thereof, the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice processed the application and forward same to the relevant authorities for further necessary action.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "But oil multinational sold all its shares, not JV assets to Seplat\n\nNOC\u2019s action opens up possible legal tussle\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited may have created a wedge in the highly acclaimed transaction that would have seen Seplat Energy, an indigenous oil firm, buy over oil shares belonging to ExxonMobil, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe deal between ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian unit, Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in August last year, had attracted plaudits from industry leaders.\n\nThe Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, THISDAY had reported, was for a purchase price of $1.283 billion, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt from officials NNPC, that the state-owned oil giant has opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets.\n\nThe RFR is reportedly contained in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) of the Joint Venture (JV), which represents NNPC\u2019s position on the planned sale of the shares to Seplat Energy Plc.\n\nEfforts to get NNPC to speak on the matter were not immediately fruitful, but a top source in the oil firm told THISDAY, \u201cWe will address it at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBut an industry source who preferred to remain anonymous said last night that NNPC\u2019s action could lead to legal tussle between Seplat and the national oil company. The source stressed that NNPC did not have the power to halt the acquisition of the multinational oil company\u2019s shares by Seplat.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSeplat bought ExxonMobil\u2019s shares, not assets. Whereas NNPC has right of pre-emption over the sale of assets, it does not have right over sale of shares.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the source explained that with its present structure, NNPC was now a commercial entity and no longer a regulator, as it used to be in the past, \u201cso, it is the regulator that can interfere in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cHowever, they have to check the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) because if they say they are taking over ExxonMobil, that means they are taking over staff, pensions and liabilities and not assets.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that NNPC had already notified Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited of its intention to exercise the right of pre-emption on ExxonMobil\u2019s planned sale of its entire asset in Nigeria\u2019s onshore and shallow waters.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that the politics underlying the stoppage of the deal could markedly derail the new verve the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was expected to bring to the industry.\n\nIt was learnt that NNPC was intending to have a special arrangement with a company belonging to a northerner operating in the oil and gas industry, under a \u201cstrategic management contract.\u201d\n\nIndustry sources said that the state-owned oil firm, which is the major shareholder in the JV with ExxonMobil, might have exercised its right of first refusal on the assets as part of a new era, which will focus solely on building the long-term profitability of the NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Mele Kyari-led company had previously conveyed its decision to exercise its rights and match any offer by interested parties for the assets following ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to receive bids for their share of the JV, the platform reported.\n\nSeplat Energy subsequently put forward a winning bid for the assets and reached an agreement with ExxonMobil.\n\nRight of pre-emption is a legal right to parties in a joint venture to be the first to be considered for any planned sale or takeover of assets in the JVs if either party choose to trade them off.\n\nA letter signed by the Group Managing Director, Kyari, and addressed to ExxonMobil, quoted NNPC as reiterating its resolve to take over the company\u2019s share of the assets.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that you reached an agreement to divest from onshore and shallow waters JVs,\u201d the letter read, adding, \u201cClearly we are interested.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the agreement, ExxonMobil had earlier said that the deals were subject to approval and the new position of NNPC, meaning that the whole process of sale and purchase agreement between ExxonMobil and Seplat Energy has to be discontinued.\n\nSeplat Energy, the company that made the winning bid, had staked over $1.2 billion for the deal to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU plus contingent consideration and was waiting for the minister\u2019s consent before the latest development.\n\nThis meant that the state-owned oil firm must not, based on its exercise of right of first refusal, pay below the $1.2 billion mark.\n\nAccording to the letter, NNPC also reiterated that it had already transformed from being a corporation to being a profit driven company and it now had the capacity to buy over the share of ExxonMobil in the Joint venture.\n\nThe NNPC had recently announced a funding agreement with Afreximbank for up to $5 billion to grow its investment in new and existing upstream assets.\n\nRecently, the publishers of Africa Oil and Gas Report raised the alarm over the attempt by the national oil company to crowd out private investors, saying that enough space should be created for some level of diversity in investment. That alarm has now proved to be a wakeup call on increasingly seemingly grab all posture.\n\nCommenting on the pre-emption rights as expressed by NNPC, Publisher of the magazine, Toyin Akinosho, who had spoken on Arise News Channel, urged NNPC to free the space for entrepreneurs to come in, insisting that the company already has a lot in its basket and was even finding it difficult to cope.\n\nAkinosho maintained, \u201cNNPC is in JV with companies that produce at least 45 per cent of our crude. That\u2019s a lot of material for them already. The assets they operate are the least optimised of all the assets in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhile accusing NNPC of grabbing assets all over the country, he wondered why the national oil company was allegedly stifling investment in the sector. According to him, the kind of partners that NNPC may hand over the assets to are always not the most experienced in the space, adding that the whole idea is \u201cgift\u201d it to a third party.\n\n\u201cIt would not manage the assets, so any excuse about \u2018this being taken over in the interest of the state\u2019 is untrue. In the last three years, it has implemented Finance and Technical Service Agreements (FTSAs), with companies that it chooses to work the assets,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*NDLEA to arraign suspended \u2018super cop,\u2019 four IRT members on eight counts of drug trafficking\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has commenced moves to extradite the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to the United States of America to face fraud allegations.\n\nFew hours after the extradition process commenced, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), which currently has Kyari in its custody following his arrest for alleged illicit drug dealing, also initiated a court process against him. By this development, Kyari, four of his colleagues in the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team (IRT), and two others would be arraigned any moment on drug-related charges.\n\nNDLEA filed an eight-count criminal charge against the defendants at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe implication of the NDLEA court action against Kyari is that he cannot be extradited to the US, even though the federal government has commenced the extradition process.\n\nSection 3 (f) of the Extradition Act says, \u201cA fugitive criminal- (a) who has been charged with an offence under the law of Nigeria or any part thereof, not being the offence for which his surrender is sought; or (b) who is serving a sentence imposed in respect of any such offence by a court in Nigeria, shall not be surrendered until such a time as he has been discharged whether by acquittal or on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.\u201d\n\nKyari, a once celebrated officer of the Nigeria Police, is currently enmeshed in various criminal allegations in connection with cases for which the \u201csuper cop\u201d had previously won accolades for fighting.\n\nFollowing the arrest and imprisonment of Abass Ramon, a.k.a Hushpuppi, over a $1.1 million wire fraud and Ramon\u2019s alleged implication of Kyari, who was then Commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the United States had requested the extradition of Kyari to explain his alleged involvement in the crime.\n\nMonths after the extradition request, yesterday, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), disclosed that the federal government had filed an application for the extradition of Kyari before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Malami stated that the application, which followed a request by the diplomatic representative of the American embassy in Abuja, was filed under the Extradition Act and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\nOnly recently, the AGF, while speaking during a television programme, assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would extradite Kyari to the US to answer to the fraud charge filed against him, Hushpuppi, and four others if the government felt convinced to do so.\n\nSpeaking on the extradition application, the minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment.\u201d He said the offence for which Kyari\u2019s extradition was being made was not political or trivial.\n\nMalami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nThe minister stated that if surrendered, Kyari would not be victimised at his trial and will not be punished, detained or have his personal liberty restricted due to race, nationality or political opinions.\u201d\n\nMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or too severe a punishment, to surrender him. He noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nNDLEA to Arraign Kyari, Four IRT Members on Eight-count Drug Charge\n\nThe federal government would any time from now arraign Kyari, four of his colleagues in the IRT, and two others on drug related offences.\n\nKyari and his co-accused were arrested on February 14 and handed over to the police for investigation over allegations bordering on illicit drug dealing.\n\nThe charge, filed yesterday and marked FHC/ABJ/CR/57/2022, was signed by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s suit, the anti-drug agency had obtained a court order to detain Kyari and others for another 14 days to enable it conclude its investigation and then charge them to court.\n\nOthers listed in the charge included Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirigba; Inspector John Nuhu; Chibuinna Patrick Umeibe; and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne.\n\nIn count one, Kyari, ACP Ubua, ASP James, Inspector Agirigba, and Inspector Nuhu, all of Intelligence Response Team were said to have between January 19 and 25, dealt in 17. 55 kilogrammes of cocaine and committed and offence contrary to and punishable under section 14 (b) of the Natural Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, CAP 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nCount one read, \u201cThat you DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday J.

          "text": "*EU observer mission meets parties, stakeholders ahead of next year\u2019s polls\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, dashed the hope and plans of many people, when it declared it would not register any new political parties, because they would not be able to participate in the 2023 general election by law.\n\nINEC, which claimed that the reason was because the new Electoral Act barred the registration of new political parties to participate in any general election twelve months before, added also that the same new electoral law, allowed for the merger of political parties, only nine months to the general elections.\n\nThere are currently 18 registered political parties in the country.\n\nHowever, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, called on INEC to be truly independent in the conduct of subsequent elections and not allow itself to be manipulated as was the case in 2019, which its National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, claimed the opposition party won but was denied.\n\nThe PDP also called on all security agencies not to allow themselves to be used to subvert electoral processes as was done during the Federal Capital Territory and other elections in Imo and Plateau States recently.\n\nAt the same time, the European Union (EU) Election Observation Follow-up Mission, led by the Head of EU Observation Mission, Mrs Maria Arena, yesterday, hinted that it has held talks with political parties and other stakeholders ahead of next elections and would give a report of its meetings soon.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting organised by the Nigeria Guild of Editors, INEC national commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman Voters Education, Festus Okoye, reiterated that, \u201cThe Act also provides that new political association must apply for registration not later than 12 months before a general election while applications for merger must be filed not later than 9 months before election.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that registration and their participation were already time barred, Okoye said, INEC has already released the timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election, fixing Presidential and National Assembly elections to hold on the 25th of February 2023 and Governorship and State Assembly Elections to hold on the 11th of March 2023.\n\nHe said the law provided that the election funds due to the Commission for any general elections were to be released to the Commission not later than one year before the election.\n\nOkoye explained that Nigeria was entering a critical and challenging phase in its electoral process as there were new, creative and progressive provisions and innovations in the new law, adding: \u201cThe law has tight timelines that must be carefully managed.\n\nUnder the new law, the Commission shall issue the Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the date fixed for the conduct of elections. Political parties must submit the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates not later than 180 days before the election.\u201d\n\nThe INEC national commissioner said the new law contained such new provisions relating to ballot boxes and voting devices, accreditation of voters, determination of over-voting, visually impaired and incapacitated voters, post-election procedure and collation of election results.\n\nAccording to Okoye, \u201cIt also contains power of the Commission to review declared results, nomination of candidates, limitation of election expenses and the jurisdiction of courts in pre-election matters among other provisions.\u201d\n\nHe called on the media to isolate and analyse these provisions and thereafter treat the entire law as a compound package for the conduct of elections in Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, he said a good knowledge of the law and its provisions would assist in crafting good editorials and holding the Commission and the Political Parties accountable to their implementation.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe 2023 general election will come with challenges and the Commission is determined to surmount these challenges and conduct free, fair, credible and inclusive election. Growing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of internally displaced persons will pose challenges to the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cSo many of the internally displaced persons are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their Permanent Voters Cards and it is next to impossibility to recreate their constituencies and polling units.\n\n\u201cThis is because section 47(1) of the Electoral Act clearly provides that a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter\u2019s card to a Presiding Officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\n\n\u201cSome of these persons are no longer in their constituencies and can no longer access their polling units and so many of them have lost their Permanent Voters Cards. While it is easy to recreate constituencies and polling units in clustered camps of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP camps), it is next to impossibility to do so for persons staying in scattered locations,\u201d he stated\n\nIn view of this, Okoye said, \u201cFor the internally displaced, the Commission will print new Permanent Voters Cards for them and recreate their polling units in their camps and they will be eligible to vote in some of the elections depending on their location and their proximity to their State and Federal Constituencies.\n\n\u201cThis is in accord with section 24(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides that, \u2018In the event of an emergency affecting an election, the Commission shall, as far as practicable, ensure that persons displaced as a result of the emergency are not disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cBased on this, the Commission developed regulations and guidelines on IDP voting and will implement the intendment of the law and the Regulations and Guidelines,\u201d he disclosed\n\nOkoye hinted that the Commission was currently at the terminal phase of its Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR), as there were so many communities that were still inaccessible to INEC registration officers.\n\nHis words: \u201cIn the next few weeks, the Commission will roll out modalities for the further devolution and rotation of the CVR to our registration areas and the security of our personnel and the registrants are fundamental to the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to register all eligible registrants but will not expose our staff to unnecessary danger. We will roll out and roll back depending on the security situation in different parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe stated said that it was important for the media to continue to highlight and analyse the causes and possible solutions to the security challenges in the country and continue to hold government accountable.\n\nHe equally explained that the various security agencies must try as much as possible to degrade if not neutralise the security threats and challenges in different parts of the country, adding that voting and the exercise of democratic mandate might not be the priority of persons enveloped in a climate and atmosphere of fear and anxiety.\n\nOn the innovations in the Commission, he said. \u201cAs some of you are aware, the Commission has introduced new and creative changes in the enumeration of voters, the party nomination processes and the conduct of elections. The Commission is currently conducting the Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR) both physically and online using the new INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has introduced an online nomination portal through which Political Parties upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates. The Commission has also introduced an online portal through which international and domestic observers and the media apply for accreditation.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for voter accreditation and authentication. The Commission introduced the INEC Result Viewing Portal (iRev) through which polling unit level results are uploaded to a result-viewing portal in real time.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is firmly of the view that greater use of technology in the electoral process will, to a large extent, reduce human interference in the voting, counting and collation process.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye said the Commission was conscious of the fact that technology did not operate itself and that the human element is ever present, but added, that the Commission would continue to learn from issues and challenges that arise from the deployment of technology as well as innovate and improve on them.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayu, who spoke yesterday when the EU Observation Mission visited, maintained that the party had evidence that security agencies were used to subvert the electoral processes in the recent bye-election in some states, while charging its members to henceforth rise up and defend their votes.\n\nSpeaking at the PDP national secretariat, Ayu charged INEC to be genuinely independent to enable democracy to thrive in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP was not making flimsy excuses of the security agencies being used to subvert the electoral processes, adding, \u201cWe have the hard core evidence and we have submitted same to INEC.\u201d\n\nHe said the PDP would mobilise and sensitise the voters as well as asked them to defend their votes when the need arises\n\n\u201cWe have seen a decline in those things, which were promoted as a political party, including the establishments or creating of certain institutions that will strengthen democracy in this country. And, therefore, we are very worried that those, instead of strengthening the democratic process, which will see democracy sustained, we see a sustained decline in those democratic practices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe identified such things like the conduct of elections, use of security services to attack judges, to attack citizens, instead of protecting them to survive the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence; I will stand by our position. We are happy that these are not just empty pronouncements, even you. You have shown to me in 2019 report, which you have read \u2013 shows clearly some of those problems that we\u2019re complaining \u2013 we\u2019ll keep complaining as long as these practices are sustained,\u201d Ayu stated .\n\nThe PDP National Chairman explained that the party had evidence that it won the 2019 general election, and lamented that justice was not done.\n\nAccording to him, it would not be good to allow such injustice to continue as was the case in the last FCT elections, where it was awarded three local governments of Abuja Municipal Area, Kuje and Bwari area councils, whereas it won 44 councillors and the APC won only 18 councillors.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral processes were subverted, because Abaji, Kwali and Gwagwalada area councils were in the rural areas of the FCT\n\nThe Head, EU Observation Mission, Arena, said the mission had been in the country meeting political parties, stakeholders and media in the last five days and would make its findings known to the public soon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*First batch expected to arrive today\n\n*Ukraine says talks with Russia agreed on humanitarian corridors\n\nChinedu Eze and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe authorities of Chopin Airport, Warsaw, yesterday cancelled the evacuation flight that was expected to bring in from Poland the first batch of Nigerians that escaped the on-going conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The plane was to take off from that airport.\n\nIn continuing reactions to the conflict, particularly by Western countries and institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group yesterday declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic consequences.\n\nThe US White House yesterday announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs in President Joe Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Russian President Vladimir Putin as the invasion of Ukraine advanced.\n\nThe flight meant to evacuate stranded Nigerians was cancelled because the aircraft overstayed its allotted duty hours. The crew that operated the Air Peace flight from Nigeria to Poland had spent their allotted hours of duty and, according to international standards, they could not exceed the allotted hours.\n\nFlight and Duty Time Limitations (FTL) recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is the rule, which ensures that aircrew fatigue does not decrease flight safety.\n\nSince most aviation incidents and accidents are result of human factors, fatigue is taken into account as a major factor, which also contributes to the human error. Therefore, fatigue of crewmembers has been an issue in civil aviation since the 1944 Chicago Convention.\n\nThe Nigerian evacuation flight was shifted to early today morning and it was expected to arrive the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, later today.\n\nAmbassador Bolaji Akinremi, who arrived Poland with the Air Peace flight, disclosed this.\n\nAkinremi explained to Arise TV, \u201cThe reality is that the flight has been rescheduled to tomorrow (Friday). The main reason is because of the delay during the check in because they have to gather them together from different hotels and by the time we would be ready after the check in, the crew that had been waiting since 9:00 am overshot their duty hour, which is allocated to them.\n\n\u201cThey have waited from 9am to 2pm. It means they have already waited five hours and they are going to have nine hours flight. That is already more than the standard allowed. So the authorities of the airport said they won\u2019t allow us to go.\n\n\u201cSo we have to come down. But arrangement has been made to ensure that we all stay together in the same hotel and we will leave very early tomorrow, 4am with the bus so that we can join the flight early.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Ambassador to Poland, Christian Ugwu, who was visibly worried over the postponement of the flight, attributed the delay to the unruly behaviour of some Nigerians who could not prepare quickly to board the flight, but also expressed optimism that the flight would take off today.\n\n\u201cI am very sure by tomorrow morning the flight will take off,\u201d Ugwu said.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that before the flight was cancelled, passengers had been allowed to board and they had all been stamped after passing through security. They were already in the aircraft before the airport authorities announced the cancellation, so the evacuees had to de-board.\n\nHowever, about 1,500 Nigerians may be missing as out of the 2,222 that were received only about 600 could be accounted for.\n\nArise News reported, \u201cNigerian authorities, the Nigerian embassy here in Poland, said they only had a count of 600. But it seems at this point, there are more than 1,500 Nigerians, who are missing.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Muhammed Buhari announced the approval of $8.5 million for the evacuation of about 5, 000 Nigerians who had moved from Ukraine to neighbouring countries where they were expected to be evacuated from.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs had arranged the evacuation of Nigerians from Ukraine\u2019s neighbouring countries.\n\nThe chartered flights were initially arranged to depart on Wednesday, to bring the first batch of Nigerians home on Thursday.\n\nThe following Nigerians, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs records indicated that evacuees received by Nigerian embassies at Hungary were 650 persons, Poland 350 persons, Romania 940 persons and Slovakia 150 persons.\n\nThe Ministry arranged that Max Air would airlift Nigerians from Romania (560 persons), Air Peace to Poland (364 persons), and Air Peace to Poland (360) persons.\n\nThe first batch of evacuees was expected to arrive Nigeria on Thursday, March 3, 2022.\n\nIMF, World Bank Declare Support for Ukraine, Mobilise $5.2bn\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank Group declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic toll.\n\nThe Brent Wood institutions made their views known about the war that was provoked by Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine in a joint statement signed by Managing Director of IMF, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, and the President of World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened by the devastating human and economic toll brought by the war in Ukraine. People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country\u2019s physical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva and Malpass noted that the war was also creating significant spill overs to other countries while commodity prices were being driven higher at the risk of further fuelling inflation that hit the poor the hardest.\n\nThey said, \u201cDisruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners.\n\n\u201cOur institutions are working together to support Ukraine on the financing and policy fronts and are urgently increasing that support. We have been in daily contact with the authorities on crisis measures.\n\n\u201cAt the IMF, we are responding to Ukraine\u2019s request for emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which our board could consider as early as next week.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we continue to work on Ukraine\u2019s Stand-By Arrangement program, under which an additional $2.2 billion is available between now and the end of June.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the World Bank Group was \u201cpreparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, starting with a fast-disbursing budget support operation for at least $350 million that will be submitted to the board for approval this week, followed by $200 million in fast-disbursing support for health and education.\u201d\n\nIt explained that this package would include the mobilisation of financing from several development partners, and welcomed the already-announced support from many bilateral partners.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe World Bank and the IMF are also working together to assess the economic and financial impact of the conflict and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. We stand ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to neighboring countries as needed. Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead. This crisis affects the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, and we offer them our full support.\u201d\n\nWhite House Announces New Sanctions on Russian Oligarchs\n\nThe White House has announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs, in Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Putin.\n\nThe new list of individuals described as \u201cPutin\u2019s cronies and their family members\u201d would be cut off from the US financial system, their assets in the US would be frozen, and their property would be blocked from use, according to a fact sheet from the White House.\n\nAccording to the CNN, there would be full blocking sanctions on eight Russian elites, plus their family members and associates.\n\nIt included a move to target Putin ally Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, \u201cone of Russia\u2019s wealthiest individuals,\u201d according to the White House, and will include his super-yacht and private jet.\n\nThe US is also sanctioning Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, whom the White House described as \u201ca top purveyor of Putin\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions \u2014 their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains,\u201d the fact sheet said.\n\nOther individuals who would be subject to full blocking sanctions are: Nikolai Tokarev (along with his wife Galina, daughter Mayya and his two luxury real estate companies); Boris Rotenberg (along with his wife Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris); Arkady Rotenberg (along with his sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya); and Sergei Chemezov (along with his wife Yekaterina, his son Stanislav and stepdaughter Anastasiya).\n\nThe list also included Igor Shuvalov (along with his five companies, his wife Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company), and Yevgeniy Prigozhin (along with his three companies, his wife, Polina, his daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel).\n\nThe US disclosed that it would also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates.\n\nThat would target oligarchs, \u201cknown to direct, authorise, fund, significantly support, or carry out malign activities in support of Russia\u2019s destabilising foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Treasury will also issue sanctions on disinformation targets. That includes SDN Strategic Culture Foundation and associated outlets Odna Rodyna, Rhythm of Eurasia, and Journal Kamerton; SouthFront; SDN InfoRos; New Eastern Outlook; Oriental Review; United World International; and Geopolitical.\n\nIt will also designate \u201c26 Russia and Ukraine-based individuals who play central roles in these organisations, enabling the Government of the Russian Federation\u2019s efforts to spread disinformation and influence perceptions as a part of their invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe US and its allies have taken a wide range of actions in recent weeks intended to punish Moscow for the invasion, including harsh new sanctions and export controls aimed at imposing severe costs on the Russian economy.\n\nBiden announced on Tuesday the US would ban Russian aircraft from US airspace, joining a growing number of countries who have closed their skies to Russia. The US and its allies have also agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their reserves.\n\nUkraine Says Talks with Russia Agreed on Humanitarian Corridors\n\nA Ukrainian negotiator said yesterday that a second round of ceasefire talks with Russia had not yielded the results Kyiv hoped for, but the sides had reached an understanding on creating humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the two sides envisaged a possible temporary ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of civilians.\n\n\u201cThat is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,\u201d Reuters quoted him to have said.\n\nThey had also reached an understanding on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. It was the first time the two sides had agreed any form of progress on any issue since Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago.\n\nPodolyak said the outcome had fallen short of Kyiv\u2019s hopes, however.\n\n\u201cTo our great regret, we did not get the results we were counting on,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can say is that we discussed the humanitarian aspect in sufficient detail, because quite a lot of cities are now surrounded. There is a dramatic situation with medicines, food, and evacuation,\u201d Podolyak said\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can SafeBoda maintain its dominance in Nigeria after 2 years?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Durosaye, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as CEO. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Durosaye\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 2 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat Safeboda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Amid Russian invasion of Ukraine, social media accounts were hacked to share Russian propaganda",
          "text": "On February 27, Nigerian web designer, Olalekan Owonikoko was away from Twitter when a friend shared a screenshot of a tweet from his account, knowing fully well that it wasn\u2019t the kind of post Owonikoko would make. After seeing the screenshot, Owonikoko was confused as he hadn\u2019t made the post.\n\nA few days before this, the Russian government launched an offensive on a neighbouring eastern European country, Ukraine. But we are an internet world, so the war has also gone to social media, with each side trying to control the narrative online. A huge propaganda war is ongoing and social media has been crucial for sharing updates, and misinformation, about the war. TikTok was used to share updates on the Russian army\u2019s march to Ukraine, while on the other side of the war, a 27-year-old Russian TikTokker Niki Proshin live-streamed an anti-war protest in Russia. Photo sharing app, Instagram, is being used by independent journalist Ilya Varlamov to record videos and take pictures that represent his version of Russia\u2019s military action. In a matter of days, Ukrainian influencer Anna Prytula moved away from her lifestyle posts to show footage of missiles attacking her country on Instagram. Social media has also seen the rise of \u201cwar pages\u201d\u2014Instagram meme pages that promise to share updates on the Ukraine conflict but are fake pages hoping to get money from advertisements.\n\nOn February 26, social media accounts linked to Buffer, the social media scheduling tool, were hacked to spread support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine under the hashtag #SupportRussia. \u201cIt was clearly not the kind of content I would share,\u201d Owonikoko said. \u201cMy friend knew this and wanted to be sure I hadn\u2019t shared such a thing. I took a minute to be sure I hadn\u2019t engaged with any content like that and accidentally shared it. It was clear my account had been hacked,\u201d said Owonikoko, who noted that though his Twitter account is set up on Buffer, he rarely uses the app. Like most propaganda and disinformation campaigns, the accounts shared the same tweet, with the same social media asset, and at the same time.\n\nA cross-section of accounts that posted the propaganda post on Twitter. Source: Reddit\n\nBuffer released a statement on February 26, where it acknowledged that Buffer accounts had been hacked to share unauthorised posts that support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Buffer revealed that 1,552 accounts were affected, while 618 accounts posted 766 unauthorised content across Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Buffer revealed in its statement that none of the 1,552 affected accounts had 2-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and attributed the hack to reused passwords.\n\nTwitter user, @Downtownrob, revealed that he doesn\u2019t have two-factor authentication (2FA) on his account, and uses a virtual assistant, Fancy Hands, which publishes WordPress articles for him via Buffer.\n\nTechCabal\u2019s Twitter account, which is linked to Buffer, was compromised and also shared the propaganda tweet. The newsroom was alerted to the development; we took the tweet down and shared a statement on Twitter clarifying the situation.\n\nThis is not the first time Russia has tried to shape international opinion about its invasion of Ukraine. Back in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea Peninsula, a network of trolls, bots, and spam accounts focused on denying military presence in the Peninsula. However, Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign goes beyond Ukraine; they affect users everywhere. For instance, a Facebook threat report released last May revealed that Russia\u2019s biggest disinformation campaigns targeted Ghana, the US, and Mexico.\n\nA few days ago, Facebook disabled a misinformation network of about 40 accounts that were pushing fake news about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Twitter said it has been removing disinformation networks linked to the Ukraine conflict. With a no-holds-barred propaganda and disinformation campaign spreading on social media, it is imperative that users take digital security measures more seriously and are careful about information they consume on social media, especially at this time.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I asked because it has become a catchword in a country with over 56 million unbanked adults.\n\nFinancially included individuals have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit, and insurance. Also, a higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could result in a poorer population because a lack of access to credit and insurance places them at a competitive economic disadvantage.\n\nThe Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), shows that Nigeria has one of the highest rates of financial exclusion in Africa at 35.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, given the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) goal to increase that figure to 94% by 2024, there is still much work to be done. And recently, the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has joined the fray.\n\nNIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, in January 2022. The platform includes a free debit card that can be used both offline and online, and it is available at all NIPOST locations in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe agency banking platform, according to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, would conform to the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) financial inclusion standards. He also stated that this is a part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise postal services and increase financial inclusion in the country.\n\nWhat is the plan? How do they intend to achieve this? You can catch up with this here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow to improve customer experience\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\nSudo Africa\u2019s $3.7 million pre-seed\n\nChari\u2019s new acquisition\n\nImproving customer experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most memorable customer service experience you\u2019ve had? It could be a good or a bad one, but trust me when I say that the bad ones outnumber the good ones, at least for me.\n\nThe most recent experience I had was on Wednesday. I wanted to buy plantain, so I inquired about the price due to its size. \u201cOmo,\u201d I said after hearing the price. \u201cThese plantains aren\u2019t good for this price\u2026\u201d I wasn\u2019t even done when the vendor cut me short, saying, \u201cGo and buy it elsewhere if it\u2019s too small.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not surprised, right? What exactly did I say to deserve that? I was indirectly expressing my dismay about the country\u2019s economic situation, and she responded in that manner? I didn\u2019t even think twice; I left for somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might not have experienced this with roadside vendors, but you may have had similar dealings with telcos, retailers, or big corporations, ranging from a long wait time to being treated rudely or simply haven\u2019t been shown empathy.\n\nCustomer experience \u2013 the feeling or memory that a customer or prospective customer has whenever they come in contact with a business \u2013 is dependent on a company\u2019s customer service.\n\nSo, how can customer experience be enhanced? Apart from demonstrating empathy or helping employees understand customers aren\u2019t angry or frustrated with them, but with the product or service, you can use tools to help improve this experience. And that is exactly what MyServiceAgent does for businesses.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a technology company offering a variety of tools to businesses to improve the customer experience. Chimgozirim walks us through what they do and how the company uses AI to help companies to improve their customer experience.\n\nPlease read it here: Built in response to COVID-19, MyServiceAgent now helps businesses improve customer experience with AI\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no news that African telecom, MTN, has joined the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Shopify in betting big on the metaverse by purchasing 144 plots of land in Africarare, South Africa\u2019s first metaverse.\n\nWhat exactly is the Metaverse? The concept of a metaverse is not new. It was first described in the novel Snow Crash, published in 1992. Several companies later created online communities based on the concept, the most notable was Second Life, which debuted in 2003.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, it is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the metaverse is a shared virtual world that people can access via the Internet. In other words, it is a virtual world in which people can live, work, shop, and interact with others from the comfort of their room in the real world.\n\nIn the metaverse, technologies VR and AR are combined to create a sense of \u201cvirtual presence.\u201d\n\nAlso, the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d did not become popular until Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta in October 2021. At the time, the company announced plans to invest $10 billion over the next year to realise its vision of the metaverse.\n\nThe big question is, why did MTN decide to join the Metaverse? Is it to follow a trend, improve customers\u2019 digital experiences, or what?

Approximately 50,000 merchants use the platform for credit and bookkeeping services. It allows these businesses to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nYesterday, the company announced that it had acquired Axa Credit, the credit branch of Axa Assurance Maroc, for $22 million.\n\nWhat does Chari do? Chari is a mobile app that allows small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) multinationals and local manufacturers and receive them in less than 24 hours. It was founded in 2020 by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (Co-founder).\n\nThe acquisition of Axa Credit will provide Chari with the credit licence required to begin lending to its FMCG B2B clients, who will then lend money to their consumer clients.\n\nChari believes that shop owners understand their customers\u2019 spending habits, where they live, and when and how they are paid, and thus can perform the credit risk assessment that a traditional bank cannot.\n\nThe company intends to charge merchants a setup fee and low-interest rates as it gains more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow to Make \u2018Friends\u2019 with Anxiety: A Simple Technique to Gain Perspective.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fintech space, phrases like \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d have become so prevalent that they\u2019ve almost certainly become buzzwords. Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "Amid poor power supply, FG vows to sanction Discos",
          "text": "As many homes and businesses continue to groan under poor power supply and lack of prepaid meters, the Nigerian government has vowed to sanction \u201cunderperforming\u201d distribution companies.\n\nThis comes more than eight years after the country\u2019s power sector was privatised, leading to the transfer of the distribution and generation companies carved out of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria to core investors on November 1, 2013.\n\nThe total power generation in the country fell to 4,117 megawatts as of 6am on Thursday from 4,470.1MW on Tuesday, according to the Nigerian electricity system operator.\n\nIn recent weeks, major cities across the country have witnessed worse-than-usual levels of power cuts.\n\nThe Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, at a press briefing in Abuja, said the performance management of the distribution companies (Discos) had been fully transferred to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) from the Bureau for Public Enterprise (BPE) as of January 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have a robust team led by the Boston Consulting Group performing a diagnostic of the performance of Discos from post privatisation to December 2021 and the results will be concluded soon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBased on the results, actions will be taken against underperforming Discos under the guidelines of our contractual agreements,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the enforcement of contractual agreements and regulatory clarity is the best way to bring underperforming Discos into compliance and improve the market.\n\nOn what it described as \u201cevolutions in the ownership of Discos,\u201d the minister noted that Abuja and Ibadan Discos \u201chave commercial transitions ongoing through UBA and AMCON respectively.\u201d\n\nThe Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) had on January 20 this year took over the control of IBEDC over the inability of the Disco to clear its acquisition loan obtained from the then Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nA court ruling empowered AMCON to take over the asset and IBEDC immediately came under receivership.\n\nAbuja Disco also had issues with the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) over acquisition loans.\n\nNERC and BPE disclosed in a joint statement in December that there was a dispute with UBA over the inability of AEDC\u2019s core investor, KANN Utility Company Limited, to service its debt to the bank.\n\nBPE agreed with the lender\u2019s request to exercise its powers as receiver/manager over KANN by exercising its power over the 60 per cent equity in AEDC as a means of recovering the acquisition granted by the bank.\n\nAnalysts at CSL Stockbrokers had noted in a recent report that since the conclusion of the privatisation, the Discos had remained the weakest link in the electricity value chain \u201cas they have been grappling with enormous operational challenges.\u201d\n\nThey said the most obvious challenge had been the absence of cost-reflective tariffs that limited their ability to fulfil their financial obligations to the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), leading NBET to default in its contractual obligation to the generation companies.\n\nRead also: Ikeja Electric, Eko DisCo, explain reason for constant power outage\n\nThe analysts had said, \u201cThe overall impact is that the power sector has continually suffered a cash crunch, forcing the government to inject funds to avert a total collapse. Despite a series of government interventions, the problems in the power sector prevail.\n\n\u201cAlthough we acknowledge that the challenges in the nation\u2019s power sector run across the entire value chain, we believe the distribution companies are the most troubled.\u201d\n\nThe power minister also said plans were in top gear to kick off the second phase of the country\u2019s mass metering programme, adding that contracts would be awarded by the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are working assiduously to ensure that all locations in the country are metered through the National Mass Metering Program. DISCOs that fail to perform will be sanctioned,\u201d he added.\n\nData obtained from the latest report by electricity regulator, NERC, showed that only 4,529,497 (about 40.95 per cent) had meters, out of a total 11,058,939 registered energy customers as of June 30, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe aim to provide meters for all households and eliminate the metering gap,\u201d Aliyu said.\n\nHe said the ongoing maintenance work on some power plants around the country contributed to outages at a time where low water levels were witnessed in dams.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cWe are having maintenance work in the Eastern Axis around Odukpani leading to reduced power supply from the usually reliable NDPHC Calabar Power Plant and we are having challenges at Okoloma Gas Station linked to Afam VI power plant.\n\n\u201cWe are working on NNPC and gas suppliers also to improve the pressure on the Western Axis that is precluding units from reaching optimum supply.\u201d",

          "text": "Ahead of the March 26 national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), aspirants for the national chairmanship position of the party have continued to lobby for support of the party\u2019s bigwigs.\n\nThe APC national convention was originally slated for February 26, but was last week moved to March 26. The shift in date, though has been kicked against by some members of the party, has provided the chairmanship aspirants the opportunity to reach out more.\n\nAbout 12 chieftains of the party are jostling for the position among who are former governors, a serving minister, as well as serving and former members of the National Assembly.\n\nSome of the aspirants are said to have the blessing of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nInitially, it was said that the choice had been narrowed down to three of the aspirants, namely, Tanko Al\u2019Makura (Nasarawa State), George Akume (Benue State) and Abubakar Bawa Bwari (Niger State).\n\nOther remaining nine aspirants are former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Saliu Mustapha, former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff and Senator representing Niger East District, Mohammed Sani-Musa.\n\nOthers are former governors of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda, Borno State, Kashim Shettima, Gombe State, Danjuma Goje, Sunny Moniedafe and Mohammed Saidu-Etsu.\n\nBut it would seem that the permutation has changed with the purported endorsement of Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State, as national chairman and Ken Nnamani, a former Senate president, as deputy national chairman, South.\n\nShortly after the meeting of the APC governors and other chieftains in Abuja last week Tuesday, Senator Adamu had met with governors of the North Central, including Yahaya Bello, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq (Kwara); Simon Lalong (Plateau); Abubakar Sani Bello (Niger) and Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, whiched fuelled the permutation that he had indeed been anointed by the President.\n\nRead also: Convention: APC rebirth group kicks against Adamu, Nnamani \u201cendorsement\u201d for chairman, deputy\n\nBut Ali Modu-Sheriff, a former governor of Borno State said he was not aware of any official statement by Buhari on endorsement of any particular candidate and zoning of the chairmanship position.\n\n\u201cOf late, I have been inundated by insinuations that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed a candidate for this all important position in our party\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cI am in the race for the National Chairmanship position of our party APC because of my strength of character, capacity and competence. My intentions are clear and explicitly for public good rather than self-interest,\u201d Modu-Sheriff said.\n\nHe further said, \u201cAs a loyal party member, I will abide by decisions of Mr President at any time he makes an official decision on zoning or endorsement of any particular candidate. I have unequivocal confidence in Mr President\u2019s capacity to make the right choice for the growth of our party.\n\n\u201cI am totally committed to work with anyone/everyone to reposition our party towards actualising a resounding victory in 2023 general elections and beyond. Our guiding principle will be the party\u2019s constitution and manifesto, and I will be committed to it.\u201d\n\nMohammed Sani Musa, a serving senator and chairmanship aspirant in continuation of his lobby with leaders and stakeholders within the party, recently paid a courtesy visit to Nasir El-Rufai, Kaduna State governor, to seek his support.\n\nSani Musa, alongside members of his campaign team, was warmly received by the host, Governor El-Rufai.\n\nHe pledged to re-engineer the party if given the opportunity to lead the APC. He also emphasised the need for the party to have the right leadership, to enable it strategise and open for all Nigerians ahead of the 2023 general election and beyond.",

          "text": "The $1.3bn planned deal between Seplat Energy Plc, a major energy company in Nigeria, and US-based ExxonMobil looks set to put the Petroleum Industry Act, which seeks to attract new oil and gas investments, to the test.\n\nWhile approving a steering committee to supervise the implementation of the PIA last year, President Muhammadu Buhari said Nigeria had lost $50 billion worth of investments in the petroleum industry since 2011 due to the absence of a new law.\n\nThe United States Energy Information Administration estimated that Nigeria lost over $15 billion annually due to the delay in the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, which was first introduced in the National Assembly in 2008.\n\nSeplat announced on Friday that it had entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil Producing Nigeria Limited (MPNU), the shallow-water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria, for $1.28 billion.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that Seplat Energy and ExxonMobil had submitted their application for ministerial consent for the deal.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) has listed conditions that must be met before the deal sails through. Mele Kyari, the group managing director of NNPC, has said that International Oil Companies (IOCs) that divest from Nigeria\u2019s upstream oil sector must address issues of abandonment and decommissioning of oil assets.\n\nThe state oil firm has expressed concern that many of the oil and gas assets sold to Nigerians since 2012, mostly by the IOCs, are rarely decommissioned or properly abandoned, a development that clearly breaches existing laws regulating the industry.\n\nRead also: Petroleum industry in confusion as FG plans to amend new PIA\n\nNNPC\u2019s position is premised on its belief that as part of a joint venture with MPNU and with a 60 percent stake, it should have the right of first refusal over any sale or pre-empt the purchase, according to industry lingo.\n\nHowever, an analysis of the NNPC Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) with private oil companies by analysts at Wood Mackenzie found that since this is share sale, not an asset sale, NNPC lacks pre-emption rights.\n\n\u201cBecause this is a corporate acquisition, NNPC has no rights to pre-empt a deal under the Joint Operating Agreement, which governs the JV. This means that ministerial consent would be the only hurdle remaining,\u201d it said.\n\nThe analysts, however, said, \u201cNothing can be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nThe same holds true for Shell\u2019s ongoing divestment by its subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company, which similarly rules out pre-emption, the analysts said.\n\n\u201cIf NNPC wants to acquire that portfolio, then it will have to out-bid the competition. If successful in raising up to US$5 billion with Afreximbank, it would have the firepower to do just that, and massively strengthen its position in the onshore delta,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nThe PIA had turned the NNPC into a commercial firm and this was expected to remove its influence over the sector as both a player and regulator.\n\nOn the implications of the deal, Wood Mackenzie analysts said if completed, it would be transformational for Seplat Energy.\n\nThey said, \u201cIt is already the leading indigenous company in Nigeria, but this will triple its working interest production to over 140,000 boe/d. In total, Seplat will operate 15 percent of Nigerian oil production.\n\n\u201cCrucially, the deal diversifies its operations into shallow water, which is largely devoid of the thefts afflicting its onshore operations. Although this is Seplat\u2019s first offshore acquisition, it will acquire all of MPNU\u2019s Nigerian staff, thus allaying any concerns about its operational capabilities.\u201d\n\nThe planned share sale by ExxonMobil covers a portfolio that includes 1.3 billion boe of contingent resources, 75 percent of which is gas and less than half of its 70 fields have been developed.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will partner the federal government on the management of the Okomu National Park, to revitalize the park and strengthen security in the area.\n\nObaseki disclosed this on Thursday while addressing the Conservator of the Okomu National Park, Mr. Augustine Obekpa, when he visited the park in Udo Community, Ovia South-West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor also stated plans to send a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration to bolster efforts at protecting the state\u2019s forest reserves.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe are going to be sending a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration next week. We will make sure that we expand the law beyond forestry assets to also cover the natural assets found around the forest.\n\n\u201cWe want to collaborate with the National Park Service. I will visit the Minister of Environment to offer her a certain proposal to allow the Edo State Government to jointly manage the park with the federal government because this is our resource.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWith that collaboration, it means that we would put in more resources. We would like to increase the number of rangers and park officers to protect not only this park but some other reserves that are around us here, particularly the Okumo Reserve and the Gelegele Reserve.\n\n\u201cWe will pay for the new hires under such an arrangement. We will upgrade your training, as well as provide more facilities and amenities for the park.\n\n\u201cNobody will come here if they don\u2019t feel secure and safe. This does not apply only to the park and the resources around this area, but it is important for people to know that they are secured when they come in to enjoy nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we improve the security of this park and expose the beauty and ecotourism opportunities of the park,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki further stated, \u201cWe have been hearing of nefarious activities of criminal elements, both in the park and the forest reserve, and also the Okomu Oil Palm Company. Today, we are on a fact finding visit to examine what exactly is going on in the park.\n\n\u201cWe have to find out the number of attacks, where the attacks are coming from and see how the state government can come in and collaborate effectively with the park using the full security system in the state to deal with the security challenges that we have here.\n\n\u201cGovernment will not just sit back and allow the kind of criminality that we are seeing in this area. Our worry is that if we don\u2019t confront them now, it will get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to get the full report from you and to understand clearly how the criminals are operating. We saw a truck outside the premises which I believe was recently seized with high quality wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know how expensive these items are. Our concern is that these criminals come in, log illegally and take the logs out, sell them and procure more arms and come in to occupy the territory,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nIn his remarks, the Conservator of the Okomu National Park said the park is home to white-throated monkeys, Buffalo and Elephants, noting that farming, hunting and illegal logging was affecting the natural habitats of the animals.\n\nObekpa appealed to the governor for logistics support to enable them to effectively protect the forest assets.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are engaging with investors in plantation agriculture so that a good cache of our forests is protected and preserved, even as they go about their businesses in a sustainable manner.\n\n\u201cWe are in partnership with stakeholders, including the Nigerian Air Force and other security agencies to preserve our forest reserve, particularly the Okomu Forest Area against criminals. This will prove critical in protecting elephants and other endangered animals in the forest. We will continue to explore even better channels to protect our endangered wildlife assets,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the UN, \u201cWorld Wildlife Day is an opportunity to celebrate the many beautiful and varied forms of wild fauna and flora and to raise awareness of the multitude of benefits that their conservation provides to people. At the same time, the Day reminds us of the urgent need to step up the fight against wildlife crime and human-induced reduction of species, which have wide-ranging economic, environmental and social impacts.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

(It allows Nigerian men\u2019s foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship); Deny Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage; Deny 35 per cent appointed positions for women and settling for 20 per cent; Deny women affirmative action in party administration and leadership; and Deny specific seats for women in the National Assembly, among others.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cIn Edo State, we have a healthy mix of women in our cabinet, as they occupy more than 30 percent of positions of commissioners and Special Advisers in government. They provide invaluable service to ensure the proper functioning of the engine of government. At the senior cadre of the civil and public service, women make up more than 50 percent of the Permanent Secretaries, which provides them with ample opportunity to serve the people. Our experience has proven that women bring a rare knack of commitment and sense of service to drive change and engender progress like never before seen in the civil service.\n\n\u201cEdo people hope that their own representatives at the National Assembly did not vote along the lines of disenfranchising their women population because to do so will mean that they do not care about those who sent them to represent them at the Assembly.\n\nStressing that the Assembly missed a golden chance, he said: \u201cIt is heartbreaking that the National Assembly members missed a golden opportunity to redesign Nigeria\u2019s political landscape by enshrining landmark legislation that promotes inclusion and provides women with the legal backing to gain equitable representation at the apex level of lawmaking and political participation.\n\n\u201cOur administration has continued to provide women with the opportunity to take up important roles in governance and they have proven to be excellent managers of human and material resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, therefore, lend my voice in calling on the National Assembly to reconsider its decision and take proactive and affirmative action in providing more opportunities for women to participate in politics, governance and all spheres of human endeavour,\u201d he stressed.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Meta, formerly the Facebook company, recently paid a courtesy visit to the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to discuss mutual interests and collaboration to tackle harmful content and educate Nigerians on avoiding ugly trends that hamper the country\u2019s socio-economic and political space.\n\nAccording to the director general of NITDA, Kashifu Inuwa CCIE, the collaborative effort between NITDA and Meta is apt given the continued circulation of fake news and misinformation on social media, which poses a threat to the nation\u2019s stability. He explained that as a leading partner, Meta has to be transparent about its efforts to the public to checkmate the excesses of the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cHow can we make it better in order to make sure that the menace of Fake News is reduced to the barest minimum,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t read messages, not to talk about verifying its authenticity. Therefore, adopting a simpler verification mechanism will reduce the spread of unsubstantiated news.\u201d\n\nThe Meta team, led by the Head of Public Policy, Anglophone West Africa, Adaora Ikenze, and her colleagues from WhatsApp, shared the steps the social media company has taken to combat misinformation in Nigeria, including partnering with various stakeholders to run educational and awareness campaigns.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking during the visit, Ikenze said that the visit is the beginning of a much more cooperative and collaborative relationship with NITDA, noting that the social media company understands the importance and value Meta platforms and products bring to the country.\n\n\u201cWe recognise that misinformation and false news particularly is becoming a huge problem, and we have worked very hard to build out strategies to try to inform and educate Nigerians to mitigate the harms around this by launching a Meta campaign called #NoFalseNewsZone and a WhatsApp campaign called #YouSaid in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCommenting further on innovation in digital technology, Inuwa said that things have changed now, and there is nothing like a digital space. \u201cWhat makes digital space are physical computers, network cables, humans that use the computers and so on \u2013 these are what make up the digital space that exists in a sovereign nation. He further said that Nigeria\u2019s journey to the realisation of digital literacy by 2030 remains sacrosanct, as it is critical to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do it alone, and we have an ambitious target. We need partners like you to achieve that,\u201d he told the Meta team. \u201cYou equally need people that will consume your services, and they need to be digitally literate before accessing them.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe visiting team from Meta also took turns making their presentations, as team members explained how WhatsApp embarked on a localised radio campaign to encourage people to verify messages before sharing them with others, including how Meta has partnered with Comic Republic to launch a 20-page comic book aimed at helping people think critically about the messages they consume and create online, identify false news, and know the actions to take to minimise its spread.\n\nWhile appreciating the company\u2019s support in broadband penetration, the NITDA DG added that there are other areas of collaborative efforts between NITDA and Meta, especially in digital literacy. He added that an online massive open course platform is being developed that will facilitate courses in Nigerian Languages in which the Agency needs their support to achieve that.",

          "text": "The federal government has announced a new strategy in the war to eliminate illiteracy and its accompanying malaise among the more than 90 million adult population and about 13 million out-of-school children in the country.\n\nUnveiling the new strategy called Literacy Enroute Economic Empowerment Strategy (LEEDS) at a one-day Strategic Management Meeting in Mararraba, Nasarawa State, on Tuesday, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education, Prof. Simon Ibor Akpama, said the new strategy will emphasise a juxtaposition of the acquisition of basic and post-literacy skills with vocational skills acquisition for the attainment of economic self-reliance.\n\nThe new system, according to Prof. Akpama, will be in addition to existing strategies, namely the Literacy-by-Radio (LBR), the Rural Facilitators\u2019 Scheme (RFS), Each-One-Teach-One and other initiatives, all aimed at facilitating the attainment of the Commission\u2019s mandate of eradicating illiteracy among Nigerians aged 15 years and above.\n\nThe Executive Secretary said the strategic meeting was a \u201cdeliberate introspective innovation aimed at rejigging, resuscitating, reforming and repositioning the Commission\u2019s extant management style for maximum productivity in synchronisation with the Commission\u2019s \u2018sacred illiteracy eradication mandate for overall national development.\u201d\n\nIn the words of the Executive Secretary, \u201cThe introduction of LEEDS is not intended to undermine and emasculate the existing illiteracy eradication methods which have made remarkable impact on the Commission\u2019s literacy delivery trajectory but to integrate the Commission\u2019s major goals, policy thrust, actions and its extant literacy delivery methods into a cohesive whole for improved performance in our service delivery drive.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen functional, LEEDS will offer graduates from both the basic and post-literacy programmes to be provided with relevant kits and starter packs to establish their own businesses such as salons, fashion designing shops and the likes, which will in turn lead to reduction in unemployment and increase in income generation.\n\nThe Executive Secretary, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, for funding of the Adult and Non-Formal education sector, stated that LEEDS will form the antidote to poverty as it has been empirically proven that mere acquisition of basic and post-literacy skills devoid of economic empowerment tools aggravates poverty with its accompanying deleterious socio-economic consequences.\n\n\u201cOur strategic plan must encapsulate the stated imperatives of the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education and unambiguously outline and reassess our preferred routes meant to accomplish the arduous task of illiteracy eradication which constitutes the synopsis of our mission and vision,\u201d Prof. Akpama stated, while calling on the management team to align their capacities, competencies and wealth of experience to ensure the success of the LEEDS strategy.\n\nIt can be recalled that the federal government recently unveiled a plan to educate about two million non-literate Nigerians annually to enable them uplift their status and enable them contribute to national development.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education was established by Act 17 of June 25, 1990, with a mandate to, among others things, provide basic education to the country\u2019s non-literate adults and youths aged 15 and above through a non-formal approach.",

It is a normal international practice. Of course, for us, it is an expression of support which we really appreciate. For now, no one has gone.

          "text": "Russia and Ukraine agreed Thursday to create humanitarian corridors for civilians fleeing intensifying fighting as Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow\u2019s advance was \u201cgoing to plan\u201d and to schedule.\n\nThe agreement was the only tangible progress from a second round of talks between Moscow and Kyiv, according to an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it was not immediately clear how they would work. A Russian negotiator, nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, confirmed the initiative and said it would be implemented soon.\n\nThe two sides met after the fall of the first major Ukrainian city to Russian forces, with Putin apparently unwilling to heed a global clamour for hostilities to end as the war entered its second week.\n\nPutin again said Russia was rooting out \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d, adding during the televised opening of a national security council meeting that he \u201cwill never give up on (his) conviction that Russians and Ukrainians are one people\u201d.\n\nHe earlier told French President Emmanuel Macron that Moscow \u201cintends to continue the uncompromising fight against militants of nationalist armed groups\u201d, according to a Kremlin account of their call.\n\nZelensky has called on the West to up its military assistance, after NATO members ruled out enforcing a no-fly zone for fear of igniting a direct war with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\n\u201cIf you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!\u201d Zelensky told a news conference.\n\n\u201cIf we are no more then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next,\u201d he said, adding that direct talks with Putin were \u201cthe only way to stop this war\u201d.\n\nThe EU has offered fighter jets already, and a source in Berlin said the German government was planning to deliver another 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc agreed further to approve temporary protection for all refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine \u2014 numbered by the United Nations at more than one million.\n\nAt the talks at an undisclosed location on the Belarus-Poland border, both sides shook hands across a table at the outset, the Ukrainian delegates in military attire and the Russians in more formal suits.\n\nA first round of talks on Monday also yielded no breakthrough, and Kyiv says it will not accept any Russian \u201cultimatums\u201d.\n\nThe invasion, now in its eighth day, has turned Russia into a global pariah in the worlds of finance, diplomacy, sports and culture.\n\nThe UN has opened a probe into alleged war crimes, as the Russian military bombards cities in Ukraine with shells and missiles, forcing civilians to cower in basements.\n\nAddressing the Putin regime in a video statement, Zelensky said: \u201cYou will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.\u201d\n\nThirty-three people died Thursday when Russian forces hit residential areas, including schools and a high-rise apartment block, in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, authorities said.\n\n\u2018Just like Leningrad\u2019\n\nZelensky claims thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed since Putin shocked the world by invading Ukraine, purportedly to demilitarise and \u201cde-Nazify\u201d a Western-leaning threat on his borders.\n\nMoscow said Wednesday that it has lost 498 troops, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin praised their sacrifice.\n\nThe Kremlin has been condemned for likening the government of Zelensky, who is Jewish, to that of Germany in World War II.\n\nWhile a long military column appears stalled north of Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv, Russian troops seized Kherson, a Black Sea city of 290,000 people, after a three-day siege that left it short of food and medicine.\n\nRussian armoured columns from Crimea \u2014 annexed by Moscow in 2014 \u2014 pushed deep into the region around Kherson, triggering fighting that left at least 13 civilians dead.\n\nNine Ukrainian soldiers were also killed, the Kherson regional administration said.\n\nRussian troops are also besieging the port city of Mariupol east of Kherson, which is without water or electricity in the depths of winter.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to create a blockade here, just like in Leningrad,\u201d Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said, referring to the brutal Nazi siege of Russia\u2019s second city, now re-named Saint Petersburg.\n\nUkrainian authorities said residential and other areas in the eastern city of Kharkiv had been \u201cpounded all night\u201d by indiscriminate shelling, which UN prosecutors are investigating as a possible war crime.\n\nOleg Rubak\u2019s wife Katia, 29, was crushed in the rubble of their family home in Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, by a Russian missile strike.\n\n\u201cOne minute I saw her going into the bedroom. A minute later there was nothing,\u201d Rubak, 32, told AFP amid the ruins in the bitter winter chill.\n\n\u201cI hope she\u2019s in heaven and all is perfect for her,\u201d he said, adding through tears, \u201cI want the whole world to hear my story.\u201d\n\nJunk status\n\nUN emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths urged Russia to allow relief workers to help Ukraine\u2019s people.\n\n\u201cProtect civilians, for God\u2019s sake, in Ukraine; let us do our job\u201d, he told AFP in Geneva.\n\nThe UN\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency urged Russia to \u201ccease all actions\u201d at Ukraine\u2019s nuclear facilities, including the site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.\n\nPutin now finds himself an international outcast, his country the subject of swingeing sanctions that sent the ruble into further free-fall Thursday.\n\nRussia\u2019s central bank \u2014 whose foreign reserves have been frozen in the West \u2014 imposed a 30-percent tax on all sales of hard currency, following a run on lenders by ordinary Russians.\n\nThe unfolding financial costs were underlined as ratings agencies Fitch and Moody\u2019s slashed Russia\u2019s sovereign debt to \u201cjunk\u201d status.\n\nTurmoil deepened on markets more broadly. European stocks slid and oil prices approached $120 per barrel.\n\nRussia\u2019s sporting isolation worsened as it lost the right to host Formula One races. The International Paralympic Committee, in a U-turn, banned Russians and Belarusians from the Beijing Winter Games.\n\nLeaving everything behind\n\nMany Ukrainians have now fled into nearby countries, according to the UN refugee agency\u2019s rapidly rising tally.\n\n\u201cWe left everything there as they came and ruined our lives,\u201d refugee Svitlana Mostepanenko told AFP in Prague.\n\nNathalia Lypka, a professor of German from the eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, arrived in Berlin with her 21-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cMy husband and son stayed\u2026 My husband already served in the army, and he had to return to duty,\u201d she said, before boarding a train for Stuttgart where friends were waiting.\n\nRussian authorities have imposed a media blackout on what the Kremlin euphemistically calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d that Western analysts say has become bogged down.\n\nTwo liberal media groups \u2014 Ekho Moskvy radio and TV network Dozhd \u2014 said they were halting operations, in another death-knell for independent reporting in Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nBut Russians have still turned out for large anti-war protests across the country, braving mass arrests in a direct challenge to the president\u2019s 20-year rule.\n\nNearly 7,000 Russian scientists, mathematicians and academics had as of Thursday signed an open letter \u201cstrongly\u201d protesting Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian oil giant Lukoil on Thursday called for an immediate halt to fighting in Ukraine, one of the first major domestic firms to speak out against the invasion.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Japan\u2019s Sony Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd said on Friday they would pair up to develop and sell battery-powered electric vehicles, and said they were open to bringing in other partners.\n\nThe companies said in a statement they would form a joint venture this year and aim to begin selling the first model in 2025. Honda will be responsible for manufacturing the first model, while Sony will develop the mobility service platform, they said.\n\n\u201cIn the joint venture, we would like to lead the mobility evolution by combining our technology and experience with Honda\u2019s long experience in mobility development and vehicle body manufacturing technologies,\u201d Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said.\n\nThe companies did not reveal financial details of the tie-up.\n\nDuring a news conference in Tokyo on Friday, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said although he is not thinking about taking the joint venture public immediately, he would not dismiss that as among the options to grow the firm.\n\nAsked whether the partnership between the two companies is exclusive, Mibe said they are open to bringing in other companies while wanting to focus on developing the electric vehicle model for now.\n\n\u201cIn the future, we would like to expand our business with an open mindset,\u201d Mibe said, adding Honda will continue to develop its own electric vehicle strategy separate from the joint venture.\n\nThe announcement comes as the electronics maker was seeking to further its ambitions to become a key player in next-generation automobiles, while automakers like Honda are under pressure to make carbon-free cars as well as vehicles equipped with features beyond traditional means of transportation.\n\nThe rapid shift to embrace electric vehicles around the world, stoked by a global push to slash carbon emissions, creates opportunities for tech companies to join the auto market since those vehicles are simpler to manufacture than cars carrying internal combustion engines.\n\nAt the same time, those tech companies face challenges of meeting rigorous safety regulations for vehicles, and making cars capable of withstanding sometimes difficult driving conditions. Yoshida announced in January a plan to create a new company, Sony Mobility, saying it was exploring a commercial launch of electric vehicles.\n\nAlthough its once-dominant position in consumer electronics has been eroded by Asian rivals like South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co, Sony still has an arsenal of sophisticated technology in areas such as sensors critical to autonomous driving.\n\nCompetition within the electric vehicle market is intensifying as well. Asked about how the joint venture would fend off challenges from competitors, Mibe said he wants it to \u201ccreate a chemical reaction\u201d that exceeds customers\u2019 expectations.",

          "text": "A huge blaze in a building at the site of Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear power station was extinguished on Friday and officials said the plant was operating normally, seized by Russian forces in heavy fighting that caused global alarm.\n\nOfficials said the fire at the Zaporizhzhia compound was in a training centre and not at the plant itself. An official at Energoatom, the state enterprise that runs Ukraine\u2019s four nuclear plants, said there was no further fighting, the fire was out, radiation was normal and Russian forces were in control.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cPersonnel are on their working places providing normal operation of the station,\u201d the official told Reuters in a message.\n\nHowever he said his organisation no longer had communication with the plant\u2019s managers, control over the radiation situation there or oversight of potentially dangerous nuclear material in its six reactors and about 150 containers of spent fuel.\n\nEarlier, a video from the plant verified by Reuters showed one building aflame, and a volley of incoming shells, before a large incandescent ball lit up the sky, exploding beside a car park and sending smoke billowing across the compound.\n\n\u201cEuropeans, please wake up. Tell your politicians \u2013 Russian troops are shooting at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine,\u201d Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address. In another address later he called on Russians to protest.\n\nHe also called on Russians to protests over the attack.\n\nThe mayor of the nearby town of Energodar about 550 km (342 miles) southeast of Kyiv said fierce fighting and \u201ccontinuous enemy shelling\u201d had caused casualties in the area, without providing details.\n\nThousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.\n\nRussian forces advancing from three directions have besieged Ukrainian cities and pounded them with artillery and air strikes. Moscow says its aim is to disarm its neighbour and capture leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call that a baseless pretext for a war to conquer the country of 44 million people.\n\nRussia had already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant north of Kyiv, which spewed radioactive waste over much of Europe when it melted down in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant is a different and safer type.\n\nFIGHTING RAGES, SANCTIONS MOUNT\n\nLoud explosions could be heard in Kyiv on Friday morning and an air raid siren blared.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has commenced moves to extradite the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to the United States of America to face fraud allegations.\n\nFew hours after the extradition process commenced, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), which currently has Kyari in its custody following his arrest for alleged illicit drug dealing, also initiated a court process against him. By this development, Kyari, four of his colleagues in the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team (IRT), and two others would be arraigned any moment on drug-related charges.\n\nNDLEA filed an eight-count criminal charge against the defendants at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe implication of the NDLEA court action against Kyari is that he cannot be extradited to the US, even though the federal government has commenced the extradition process.\n\nSection 3 (f) of the Extradition Act says, \u201cA fugitive criminal- (a) who has been charged with an offence under the law of Nigeria or any part thereof, not being the offence for which his surrender is sought; or (b) who is serving a sentence imposed in respect of any such offence by a court in Nigeria, shall not be surrendered until such a time as he has been discharged whether by acquittal or on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.\u201d\n\nKyari, a once celebrated officer of the Nigeria Police, is currently enmeshed in various criminal allegations in connection with cases for which the \u201csuper cop\u201d had previously won accolades for fighting.\n\nFollowing the arrest and imprisonment of Abass Ramon, a.k.a Hushpuppi, over a $1.1 million wire fraud and Ramon\u2019s alleged implication of Kyari, who was then Commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the United States had requested the extradition of Kyari to explain his alleged involvement in the crime.\n\nMonths after the extradition request, yesterday, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), disclosed that the federal government had filed an application for the extradition of Kyari before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Malami stated that the application, which followed a request by the diplomatic representative of the American embassy in Abuja, was filed under the Extradition Act and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the extradition application, the minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment.\u201d He said the offence for which Kyari\u2019s extradition was being made was not political or trivial.\n\nMalami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nThe minister stated that if surrendered, Kyari would not be victimised at his trial and will not be punished, detained or have his personal liberty restricted due to race, nationality or political opinions.\u201d\n\nMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or too severe a punishment, to surrender him. He noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence. Only recently, the AGF, while speaking during a television programme, assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would extradite Kyari to the US to answer to the fraud charge filed against him, Hushpuppi, and four others if the government felt convinced to do so.Speaking on the extradition application, the minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment.\u201d He said the offence for which Kyari\u2019s extradition was being made was not political or trivial.Malami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.The minister stated that if surrendered, Kyari would not be victimised at his trial and will not be punished, detained or have his personal liberty restricted due to race, nationality or political opinions.\u201dMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or too severe a punishment, to surrender him. He noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence. NDLEA to Arraign Kyari, Four IRT Members on Eight-count Drug Charge The federal government would any time from now arraign Kyari, four of his colleagues in the IRT, and two others on drug related offences.\n\nKyari and his co-accused were arrested on February 14 and handed over to the police for investigation over allegations bordering on illicit drug dealing.\n\nThe charge, filed yesterday and marked FHC/ABJ/CR/57/2022, was signed by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s suit, the anti-drug agency had obtained a court order to detain Kyari and others for another 14 days to enable it conclude its investigation and then charge them to court.\n\nOthers listed in the charge included Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirigba; Inspector John Nuhu; Chibuinna Patrick Umeibe; and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne.\n\nIn count one, Kyari, ACP Ubua, ASP James, Inspector Agirigba, and Inspector Nuhu, all of Intelligence Response Team were said to have between January 19 and 25, dealt in 17. 55 kilogrammes of cocaine and committed and offence contrary to and punishable under section 14 (b) of the Natural Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, CAP 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nCount one read, \u201cThat you DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday J.

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited may have created a wedge in the highly acclaimed transaction that would have seen Seplat Energy, an indigenous oil firm, buy over oil shares belonging to ExxonMobil, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe deal between ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian unit, Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in August last year, had attracted plaudits from industry leaders.\n\nThe Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, THISDAY had reported, was for a purchase price of $1.283 billion, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nHowever, a report by Platforms Africa, a news, business and leadership medium, stated that the state-owned oil giant had opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets.\n\nThe RFR is reportedly contained in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) of the Joint Venture (JV), which represents NNPC\u2019s position on the planned sale of the shares to Seplat Energy Plc.\n\nEfforts to get NNPC to speak on the matter were not immediately fruitful, but a top source in the oil firm told THISDAY, \u201cWe will address it at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBut an industry source who preferred to remain anonymous told THISDAY last night that NNPC\u2019s action could lead to legal tussle between Seplat and the national oil company. The source stressed that NNPC did not have the power to halt the acquisition of the multinational oil company\u2019s shares by Seplat.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSeplat bought ExxonMobil\u2019s shares, not assets. Whereas NNPC has right of pre-emption over the sale of assets, it does not have right over sale of shares.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the source explained that with its present structure, NNPC was now a commercial entity and no longer a regulator, as it used to be in the past, \u201cso, it is the regulator that can interfere in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cHowever, they have to check the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) because if they say they are taking over ExxonMobil, that means they are taking over staff, pensions and liabilities and not assets.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that the politics underlying the stoppage of the deal could markedly derail the new verve the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was expected to bring to the industry.\n\nIt was learnt that NNPC was intending to have a special arrangement with a company belonging to a northerner operating in the oil and gas industry, under a \u201cstrategic management contract.\u201d\n\nIndustry sources said that the state-owned oil firm, which is the major shareholder in the JV with ExxonMobil, might have exercised its right of first refusal on the assets as part of a new era, which will focus solely on building the long-term profitability of the NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Mele Kyari-led company had previously conveyed its decision to exercise its rights and match any offer by interested parties for the assets following ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to receive bids for their share of the JV, the platform reported.\n\nSeplat Energy subsequently put forward a winning bid for the assets and reached an agreement with ExxonMobil.\n\nRight of pre-emption is a legal right to parties in a joint venture to be the first to be considered for any planned sale or takeover of assets in the JVs if either party choose to trade them off.\n\nA letter sighted by Platforms Africa, signed by the Group Managing Director, Kyari, and addressed to ExxonMobil, quoted NNPC as reiterating its resolve to take over the company\u2019s share of the assets.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that you reached an agreement to divest from onshore and shallow waters JVs,\u201d the letter read, adding, \u201cClearly we are interested.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the agreement, ExxonMobil had earlier said that the deals were subject to approval and the new position of NNPC, meaning that the whole process of sale and purchase agreement between ExxonMobil and Seplat Energy has to be discontinued. It was gathered that NNPC had already notified Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited of its intention to exercise the right of pre-emption on ExxonMobil\u2019s planned sale of its entire asset in Nigeria\u2019s onshore and shallow waters.However, a reliable source told THISDAY that the politics underlying the stoppage of the deal could markedly derail the new verve the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was expected to bring to the industry.It was learnt that NNPC was intending to have a special arrangement with a company belonging to a northerner operating in the oil and gas industry, under a \u201cstrategic management contract.\u201dIndustry sources said that the state-owned oil firm, which is the major shareholder in the JV with ExxonMobil, might have exercised its right of first refusal on the assets as part of a new era, which will focus solely on building the long-term profitability of the NNPC Limited.The Mele Kyari-led company had previously conveyed its decision to exercise its rights and match any offer by interested parties for the assets following ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to receive bids for their share of the JV, the platform reported.Seplat Energy subsequently put forward a winning bid for the assets and reached an agreement with ExxonMobil.Right of pre-emption is a legal right to parties in a joint venture to be the first to be considered for any planned sale or takeover of assets in the JVs if either party choose to trade them off.A letter sighted by Platforms Africa, signed by the Group Managing Director, Kyari, and addressed to ExxonMobil, quoted NNPC as reiterating its resolve to take over the company\u2019s share of the assets.\u201cWe are aware that you reached an agreement to divest from onshore and shallow waters JVs,\u201d the letter read, adding, \u201cClearly we are interested.\u201dAnnouncing the agreement, ExxonMobil had earlier said that the deals were subject to approval and the new position of NNPC, meaning that the whole process of sale and purchase agreement between ExxonMobil and Seplat Energy has to be discontinued. Seplat Energy, the company that made the winning bid, had staked over $1.2 billion for the deal to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU plus contingent consideration and was waiting for the minister\u2019s consent before the latest development.\n\nThis meant that the state-owned oil firm must not, based on its exercise of right of first refusal, pay below the $1.2 billion mark.\n\nAccording to the letter, NNPC also reiterated that it had already transformed from being a corporation to being a profit driven company and it now had the capacity to buy over the share of ExxonMobil in the Joint venture.\n\nThe NNPC had recently announced a funding agreement with Afreximbank for up to $5 billion to grow its investment in new and existing upstream assets.\n\nRecently, the publishers of Africa Oil and Gas Report raised the alarm over the attempt by the national oil company to crowd out private investors, saying that enough space should be created for some level of diversity in investment. That alarm has now proved to be a wakeup call on increasingly seemingly grab all posture.\n\nCommenting on the pre-emption rights as expressed by NNPC, Publisher of the magazine, Toyin Akinosho, who had spoke on Arise News Channel, urged NNPC to free the space for entrepreneurs to come in, insisting that the company already has a lot in its basket and was even finding it difficult to cope.\n\nAkinosho maintained, \u201cNNPC is in JV with companies that produce at least 45 per cent of our crude. That\u2019s a lot of material for them already. The assets they operate are the least optimised of all the assets in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhile accusing NNPC of grabbing assets all over the country, he wondered why the national oil company was allegedly stifling investment in the sector. According to him, the kind of partners that NNPC may hand over the assets to are always not the most experienced in the space, adding that the whole idea is \u201cgift\u201d it to a third party.\n\n\u201cIt would not manage the assets, so any excuse about \u2018this being taken over in the interest of the state\u2019 is untrue. In the last three years, it has implemented Finance and Technical Service Agreements (FTSAs), with companies that it chooses to work the assets,\u201d he added.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
