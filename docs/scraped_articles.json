          "text": "No river bank handed over to Fulani herders\n\nSays Bill will change narrative in water sector\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Water Resources, Engr Suleiman Adamu, has said it is ignorant and unpatriotic Nigerians who are criticizing the National Water Resources Bill before the National Assembly and misleading others.\n\nAdamu stated this during a press conference at the Ministry\u2019s headquarters, where he said some Nigerians are deliberately misinforming and misleading others about the provisions of the Bill, whereby inciting them against the Bill, because they have failed to understand the provisions of the Bill which is in the interest of Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, those opposing the Bill are people who are mining water without paying the necessary taxes and licencing fees at the detriment of other Nigerians.\n\nRead Also:\n\nProposed water bill and best practices in water resources management\n\nHow FG will control water resources if Reps\u2019 bill passes into law\n\nWater Resources Bill: FG has ulterior motives \u2014 Ndokwa youths\n\nWhile some do not want to read the Bill because they do not believe in the Buhari-led administration.\n\nHe added that the bill is being done by Nigerian experts including those from the southern part of the country.\n\nHe said the Bill is basically to improve the water service delivery based on the new draft of the Bill, which is all encompassing.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will not stop talking about them because a certain segment of society that does not seem to appreciate has taking it upon themselves this Bill as political when it should not thereby causing a lot of misconception, and deliberately misleading Nigerians knowing fully well that some people will not even bother to look at what is happening, they prefer to take issues from the headlines and just continue to harp on them.\n\n\u201cPeople take water for granted because they don\u2019t accord it the priority it deserves and also being elitist society people tend to look at issues that have on them on what they do on day-to-day basis maybe transportation and others\n\n\u201cPeople ignorantly say what they don\u2019t know about the Bill.\n\n\u201cWe cannot just keep quiet while the Nigerian citizenry is being fed false narratives about what we are trying to do.\n\n\u201cOne of the ironies of this issue of the National Water Resources Bill that is very important is there had always been a kind of accusation maybe complaints about the water sector; water service delivery is not there, and others.\u201d\n\nHe also made it clear that the Bill never made provision to grab land or river banks for Fulani herders as being conceived by a section of Nigerians, because State Governments still retain power over land resources as contained in the Bill.\n\n\u201cPeople are talking about land grab and say throw away this bill in what we call in local parlance, \u2018throwing the baby with the bath water\u2019.\n\n\u201cCould it be there is nothing good about this Bill? That everything about this Bill is negative that people are saying throw it out.\n\n\u201cIs it not time for people including skeptics to sit down and say wait a minute, what are the key provisions of this Bill, but the antagonists have keep on harping that this is about land grab, RUGA, providing Fulani herders banks of the river, and others.\n\n\u201cThese laws in the water resources sector have been in existence for nearly 40 years ago, Fulani herders have never been given that land because there is no provision in that law.\n\n\u201cWe must not be made a laughing stock at the international level. Let common sense prevail\u201d, he stated.\n\nHowever, he explained that the bill, having generated controversies over the years has been reviewed by many water experts and highly skilled legal professionals.\n\nSome of the innovations captured in the review include the institutionalization of independent body to help reposition and regulate the water sector.\n\nMeanwhile, he (Adamu) expressed confidence about the commitment and patriotism of members of the National Assembly in passing the Bill into law based on their knowledge to take decisions in favour of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThey are our representatives and I am confident that they will represent us well\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso speaking was a water resources expert, Engr Benson Ajesegiri, stressed that the Water Resources Bill will bring peace and development to the people while speaking via zoom during the media conference.\n\nA legal consultant for National Water Resources Bill 2022, Tanwa Koya, called for.closer view and understanding about the Bill, \u201cWe look at the bill from the perspective of what we tend to achieve as a nation.\u201d\n\nKoya added that the bill provides an institutional framework for the effective governance of the Water Sector.\n\nThe Executive Director of Nigeria Integrated Water Resources Management Commission, Engr Bashir Magashi, said the Bill is for the best interest of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

In 2020, also under Buhari\u2019s government, the union was on strike for 9 months.\n\nThe industrial action has crippled academic activities in government universities across the country.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Adamu Adamu, Minister of Education, was granted approval by President Buhari to resolve issues of contention regarding the ASUU strike.\n\n\n\nIn an old video trending online, Buhari was heard castigating then-President Jonathan\u2019s administration for failing to reach an agreement with the lecturers\u2019 union.\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the 2014 National Conference convened by the ex-President, Buhari picked holes with the timing of the event which came at a time ASUU, Polytechnic lecturers and other arms of tertiary institutions unions were on strike.\n\n\n\nHe faulted the government for earmarking the sum on N7 billion for the confab, saying a serious government would not spend so much money on frivolity while the tertiary institutions workers were on strike.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you could recall, at the time the government said it was voting N7 billion for the conference, ASUU was on strike. And teachers of other tertiary institutions, like the polytechnics, were on strike,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis strike was on for almost an academic year and a serious government, if they had N7 billion to throw about, would go and negotiate with ASUU and the teachers\u2019 organisations and the teachers\u2019 unions of the tertiary institutions of the polytechnics downwards so that our children will remain in schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is there, if you want to amend the constitution so why go and take N7 billion that we could not afford when our children are on the streets? I think this government has the capacity for wrong priorities that are hurting us as a nation.\u201d",

          "text": "In 2014, Muhammadu Buhari, as a member of the opposition criticised the then President, Goodluck Jonathan \u202aover a strike action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\n\n\nASUU is currently on strike after embarking on industrial action on February 14, 2022, over President Buhari\u2019s government\u2019s failure to honour an agreement on issues relating to funding of universities, and lecturers\u2019 salaries and allowances.\n\nThe ongoing strike action by the university lecturers\u2019 union is in its fifth month. In 2020, also under Buhari\u2019s government, the union was on strike for 9 months.\n\nThe industrial action has crippled academic activities in government universities across the country.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Adamu Adamu, Minister of Education, was granted approval by President Buhari to resolve issues of contention regarding the ASUU strike.\n\n\n\nIn an old video trending online, Buhari was heard castigating then-President Jonathan\u2019s administration for failing to reach an agreement with the lecturers\u2019 union.\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the 2014 National Conference convened by the ex-President, Buhari picked holes with the timing of the event which came at a time ASUU, Polytechnic lecturers and other arms of tertiary institutions unions were on strike.\n\n\n\nHe faulted the government for earmarking the sum on N7 billion for the confab, saying a serious government would not spend so much money on frivolity while the tertiary institutions workers were on strike.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you could recall, at the time the government said it was voting N7 billion for the conference, ASUU was on strike. And teachers of other tertiary institutions, like the polytechnics, were on strike,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis strike was on for almost an academic year and a serious government, if they had N7 billion to throw about, would go and negotiate with ASUU and the teachers\u2019 organisations and the teachers\u2019 unions of the tertiary institutions of the polytechnics downwards so that our children will remain in schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is there, if you want to amend the constitution so why go and take N7 billion that we could not afford when our children are on the streets? I think this government has the capacity for wrong priorities that are hurting us as a nation.\u201d",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft. Later this year, starting with the US and Canada, the platform will introduce a cheaper ad-tier option for streamers.\n\nThe platform is also taking a tough stance on password-sharing as it announced the testing of an \u201cadd a home\u201d feature which will charge users an extra $3 to share accounts with users in other households. \u201cWe know this will be a change for our members,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023.\u201d\n\nRevenue soars\n\nIn its letter to its shareholders, the service stated that Q2 was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d.\n\nWhile its total number of subscribers might have declined by 970,000, its year-on-year revenue, however, increased by 9% in Q2 2022.\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nThe streamer\u2019s net profit for the quarter was $1.44 billion, up 6.5% from $1.35 billion in Q2 2021. It, however, noted that it expects its revenue growth would slow to 4.5% by Q3.\n\nDespite this news, Netflix\u2019s shares jumped by 7% after the report was released.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Hannah Subayi believes the gap between Anglophone and Francophone African startups is reducing",
          "text": "Hannah Subayi Kamuanga\u2019s passion for investing is evident in the many hats she wears as a foremost investor in the African tech ecosystem.\n\nShe\u2019s currently the country manager for development finance institution Propaco in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a board member of the African Business Angel Network, and a partner at Dazzle Angels, a female-focused angel fund. She\u2019s also an investment committee member in 2 pan-African investment funds: Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures.\n\nPrior to her taking up these roles, she spent 7 years at South Suez Capital, an African private equity fund, and 2 years at the Switzerland-headquartered financial services company, Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cI love to find, identify talent, provide capital, and see talent grow to create something out of the business, see it grow over time,\u201d Subayi shared with TechCabal over a call. \u201cInvesting in companies allows me to combine my data crunching technical skills and legal skills, such as poring over legal briefs or policy documents, while redefining the future of Africa one investment at a time.\u201d\n\nTechCabal sat down with Subayi to learn more about her experience and life as an African investor.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What does investing mean to you?\n\nHannah Subayi: Investing is really about identifying talent, whether it\u2019s a startup, a large business, or a team of promoters trying to set up infrastructure projects. You assess funding needs, structure a deal, invest and monitor the investments. This turns out to have a massive impact in Africa, which I\u2019m very passionate about, and then obviously, you make money while at it.\n\nCurrently, as Propaco\u2019s country officer in DRC, which is a frontier market, I have the opportunity to invest through the entire spectrum of different projects from infrastructure financing, down to early-stage startups. Without any conflict, I also advise Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures, which is the most active fund on the continent with 90% of our founders being local African founders and 25% of them being female.\n\nAs an investor, I\u2019d like to ensure that founders in markets like DRC and Madagascar are also getting the funding that they need from institutional investors.\n\nPersonally, I have set up a new investment club here in the DRC. In March, we did our first seed investment in a local Congolese company manufacturing and distributing industrial cleaning products such as soaps and toothpaste, which are made from local African products like palm oil.\n\nThis investment is a big deal for us because DRC is a typical African country where about 80\u201390% of our products are actually imported. We don\u2019t have any active industries outside of the mining industry. One of our mission statements as an investment club is that we\u2019re going to support local companies that\u2019ll turn out to become as big as Africa\u2019s leading industrial conglomerate, Dangote, and help industrialise the economy in DRC.\n\nDA: What has the transition from private equity to angel investing and venture capital been like?\n\nHS: As an investor, I\u2019m quite passionate about reinventing myself. Every 3\u20134 years I discover new industries, new financial instruments, and products. I started out investing through private equity in Africa for a few years; this prepared me as I built my own personal wealth to become an angel investor to back the next wave of entrepreneurs.\n\nI started Dazzle Angels angels back in 2019, right after investing for many years through private equity. I think my experience as an angel investor led me to become more passionate about startups and early-stage investments. And with many investment clubs behaving more like VC firms, despite not having the same technical skills, network and funds, it\u2019s natural that many angel investors move over to become VC investors.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in startups you want to invest in?\n\nHS: For me, I really like to focus on the team, focusing on their consistency and ability to deliver, as well as their resilience, because I think it\u2019s really important in Africa to be resilient.\n\nI ask questions such as do I like the business? Do I understand what they do? Do I feel like there is a prospect for growth and profitability? How disruptive are businesses or what type of impact do they have on the ground?\n\nWhat is the execution risk? Personally, when I look at an investment opportunity I think of how I can mitigate all of those risks. Obviously, you have to consider the competitive dynamics of the sector and the regulatory environment. But again, with the right team and the right business model, you can navigate those things pretty easily.\n\nIn addition, the deal structure is important because you need to make sure that you\u2019re providing the right amount of funding.\n\nDA: What red flags do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nHS: Personally, it\u2019s always down to the people. For me, a red flag is when the entrepreneur is not completely committed or convinced by his business, his venture\u2014if he\u2019s running 4 or 5 other projects.\n\nThe next has to do with the deal terms, which is also a reflection of the team. I think as an investor if you\u2019re not comfortable with the deal terms, and you feel that the entrepreneur is asking for a valuation that\u2019s too high or asking for terms that are too negative for you, then it\u2019s something you might want to walk away from.\n\nFor example, there have been instances when entrepreneurs that don\u2019t have a turnover or make less than $5,000\u201310,000 per month state that their valuation is $5 or $10 million. I often reply by telling them that\u2019s not how it works. These unreasonable expectations are reflected in the terms of the percentage founders offer investors. This also comes up when founders expect investors to make too many business introductions for them. Obviously, as an investor, you\u2019re to make a few introductions but not to become the commercial director.\n\nSo already during the due diligence phase, if you hear that the entrepreneurs are asking for many things like commercial introductions that you can\u2019t deliver, then I think you should walk away, and vice versa.\n\nDA: Can you share an overview of what investing in the different regions of Africa look like?\n\nHS: The difference between regions in Africa is a reflection of the economic and social development history. As you know anglophone Africa tends to be a bit more advanced than Arab-speaking and francophone Africa.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak too much about lusophone Africa\u2014Portuguese-speaking countries\u2014even though I\u2019ve made an investment in a startup in Mozambique because I think these are frontier markets with a different language, which are not that connected to the rest of the continent.\n\nNevertheless, we noticed that in all the 3 main regions\u2014anglophone, Arab-speaking, and francophone\u2014we see more and more local institutional funders being active with the right technical skills and willingness to back local champions, which is very optimistic.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an improvement in the regulatory environment. More startup investment clubs are being supported by local governments. We see universities putting in place structures to assist students who want to create their own startups. We see VC firms being more active at the seed level, series A, and other levels. Generally speaking on the continent, there is still a lack of sufficient pre-seed funding, which typically is taken care of by the government.\n\nThe quality of companies is increasing everywhere. I\u2019m always happy to demonstrate that even in francophone Africa, you\u2019ll find 5 founders and startups who have better metrics in terms of turnover, number of users, and profitability than in Anglophone Africa.\n\nHowever, we cannot deny that the operational environment remains a bit tougher to some extent in francophone Africa. So, obviously, if you\u2019re a founder in one of these francophone markets, compared to someone who might be in South Africa, or Egypt, you\u2019ll struggle a bit more and the pace at which your business grows is not the same.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an increase in intra-Africa transactions. So, we see more North African investors who are trying to get into anglophone Africa. We see more anglophone African investors trying to invest in francophone Africa. So it\u2019s very exciting to be alive at this time when investors and startups are operating across different regions.\n\nPart of the reason why this is happening is that there are more investors just like me who have worked and studied across different regions, enabling them to understand the different contexts and navigate them better. We have more African investors who are well-rounded in terms of understanding the different ecosystems and we see an increase in investment into the 3 regions, and hopefully, francophone Africa will continue to catch up.\n\nDA: Anything more, especially about the francophone Africa space?\n\nHS: Historically, francophone Africa, just by virtue of the language, mainly only looked to France for funding and expansion. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case anymore.\n\nIf you look at startups, like Wave, you can see that most of the funding came from the US and other international investors. If you look at francophone African startups, they are incorporated in Paris but that\u2019s not any different from other startups that are incorporated in Delaware.\n\nIrrespective of where startups are incorporated, I think that there\u2019s some uniformity around standard practices and strategies of startups in the continent, which also explains why we see an uptick in investments for Africa. There\u2019s a similarity in the way entrepreneurs think about their growth and expansion and how they talk to investors, which is literally what you want because you want to make sure that everybody\u2019s playing on an equal field and to make sure that startups are receiving the right level of funding.\n\nDA: What\u2019s it like being a female investor?\n\nHS: I think there are many features in my profile that some people might interpret in a good or negative way, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about positioning. It\u2019s all about being consistent in terms of who you are as an investor, what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and connecting with the right type of opportunities.\n\nAs a female investor in francophone Africa, I haven\u2019t really felt potentially discriminated against because I\u2019ve worked with entrepreneurs who respect me. Typically, if you demonstrate that you have the right technical skills, the right network, and are a nice person, people will work with you.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to managing our careers or raising funds, it might be more challenging for female investors. But it\u2019s a representation of the issues that female professionals face in all industries. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the worst in the investment space.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding what you can bring to the table and adapting your strategy to suit the person you\u2019re dealing with. Also, at the end of the day, as an investor, you also have to walk away from situations and opportunities that are clearly not capable or willing to work with you.\n\nDA: How do you spend your time? What does a typical day look like?\n\nHS: When I look at all the great African investors like Mariame Diop, Zachariah George, or Tomi Davies who are doing much more than I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s always humbling.\n\nManaging Propaco in DRC takes most of my time, attending investor committees, talking to CEOs of large companies and startups to talk about due diligence processes monitoring, investment, doing site visits, as well as here in DRC. I also occasionally deal with lawyers to be sure the legal documentation is correct or dealing with litigation.\n\nI do all of this and attend social events like seminars and conferences. We don\u2019t talk enough about that because as an investor, it\u2019s quite important to be well connected to your business community, whether it\u2019s other investors or entrepreneurs.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nHS: When we started Launch Venture Africa last year, we were investing in startups with no revenue but now it\u2019s difficult for us to look at a startup that\u2019s not generating at least $20,000. That\u2019s how competitive the market has become.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more investments between various financial institutions. We\u2019re seeing more synergies between investment clubs, and there are new structures that are put in place that are a mix of investment clubs and VC funds, like Future Africa and Dakar Network Angels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Inside Kenya's messy money laundering spat with Nigerian fintechs",
          "text": "Inventing Anna and Ozark, two movies that have attracted global attention for their engaging crime-focused narratives, have lured Netflix subscribers into spending what amounts to be 208 centuries (20,800 years) during their runtime. A major similarity between both shows is the theme of money laundering. A phenomenon governments are grappling with globally. Kenya has featured some interesting news in recent weeks. Does it befit a movie? Well, why not read on.\n\nOn July 6, 2022, Kenyan publication, Star.co announced that a Kenyan high court had ordered the freezing of 56 accounts mainly belonging to Nigerian fintech juggernaut, Flutterwave. The decision to freeze these accounts, which had the sum of Ksh7 billion ($59 million) was made after the Asset Recovery Agency of Kenya, (ARA) told the court that the accounts were suspected money laundering conduits.\n\nHuge reactions followed this news, and while things didn\u2019t look good for Flutterwave given its recent run-ins with controversies, the skies were not clear for other Nigerian fintech companies.\n\nOn July 14th, 2021, a Kenyan high court again ordered that the accounts of two more Nigerian fintech startups, Korapay and Kandon technologies be frozen with the sum of ksh 45 million ($380,000).\n\nThe ARA alleged that both companies siphoned up to $6 billion with the suspicious movement of funds. It also stated that both companies were linked to Flutterwave and the related companies it accused of money laundering.\n\nBoth Flutterwave and Korapay have come out to deny these claims in their respective official statements. While Flutterwave stated that the allegations were false, it did not provide further information on the actual realities of the situation.\n\nKorapay, on the other hand, explained that the frozen funds in question were part of the requirements to obtain a payments processing license in Kenya.\n\nHowever, the issues run deep, and this is not the first time Nigerian companies have been flagged in Kenya. So far, the Kenyan government has frozen $*** billion in funds belonging to Nigerian firms.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a quick detour to understand the space.\n\nKenya\u2019s battle with money laundering\n\nMoney laundering regulations are very strict globally, and the laws constantly need to be updated. According to the UN, about 2- 5% of the world\u2019s GDP 800 billion to $2 trillion is generated from people trying to conceal the origin of illegally obtained funds using foreign banks or legitimate businesses as a front.\n\nA company or its founder could be directly involved in money laundering activities, or customers of financial institutions could take advantage of a loophole to facilitate their criminal process.\n\nAs you can already guess, that\u2019s why financial services companies are big on know-your-customer (KYC) requirements when opening an account. The potential for financial losses, organised crime, and terrorism, have made the financial sector one of the most heavily regulated in the world.\n\nWhile financial services institutions have strict regulations, money laundering still drains an average of $1.6 trillion annually from the global economy.\n\nTraditional finance companies have long struggled to keep up with the dynamism of fraudsters that keep finding creative ways to launder money, but research shows that fintechs have higher risks.\n\nThe rise of fintechs has reshaped the way we look at the financial services space globally. Per Sanction Scanner, the high growth and massive transaction volumes expose fintechs to several bad actors which might be difficult to control.\n\nHow? Criminals are constantly finding loopholes in an airtight system and when the company in question is a fintech, this can happen at high volumes. Against this backdrop, regulators either readjust or overhaul any existing frameworks.\n\nKenya\u2019s Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act (POCAMLA) 2009 contains comprehensive guidelines for guarding against money laundering processes and other significant financial crimes.\n\nThis led to the formation of the ARA which is tasked with identifying, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscating crime proceeds in Kenya. An analogous body in Nigeria is the National Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU).\n\nMost times, issues in the regulatory space do not get to the ARA. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) does the heavy work of keeping financial services companies in line with these regulations. On occasions when companies work on the fringes of these regulations and escape the direct lenses of the CBK, it\u2019s inevitable that the ARA would swoop in.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, when a bank flags a suspicious transaction, it flags the account and invites the customer to clarify what the transaction was meant for. In more serious cases In Nigeria, the bank could report to the NFIU, or if it\u2019s high profile enough, the body could become actively involved in the process.\n\nInterestingly, the POCAMLA allows the ARA to freeze the account of any company where a suspicious transaction is flagged. The agency can freeze it for 45 days, and if it\u2019s not convinced, it can ask for an extra 90 days to finalise its investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that if the ARA freezes accounts it will still have to determine if there was any wrongdoing from the affected parties.\n\nSo far, the agency has made some high-profile issued court orders to freeze accounts of suspected companies. However, recent reports suggest that Kenya is becoming a hotbed for money laundering, and Nigerian fintech companies are seemingly facing the heat of its renewed stringent measures.\n\nWhy is Kenya seemingly attacking Nigeria?\n\nIn many quarters, Nigeria\u2019s reputation as the origin of several Internet-based scams precedes it. The narrative is, however, not so straightforward as shown in this video below.\n\nAt first glance, it would seem that the ARA of Kenya seemingly has it out for Nigerian companies. A closer look at Flutterwave\u2019s and Korapay\u2019s statements, makes this seem like this is yet another case of regulations not catching up nicely with innovation.\n\nHowever, deeper research shows there\u2019s smoke emanating from the bunch of coals. Whether you interpret the series of information I\u2019m about to provide as suspicious or par from the course will depend on where you stand in the innovation vs regulation debate.\n\nNigeria has featured heavily in Kenya\u2019s recent crusade against money laundry. Before KiwiPay, Flutterwave, KoraPay, and Kando Technologies, Nigerian company Multigate Limited, and Avalon offshore logistics were also implicated in the ARA\u2019s investigation.\n\nMultigate Limited, founded by Nehikhare Eghosasere and Demuren Olufemi Olukunmi (who is an executive at Venture Garden Group, is reportedly the subject of an Interpol and ARA investigation.\n\nHowever, the current investigation on money laundering is not solely targeted at Nigerian companies. In June 2022, a Kenyan court, on the ARA\u2019s appeal, froze Sh2.3 billion ($19.48 million) in KiwiPay\u2019s account, a Singapore-based fintech startup. The appeal was based on money laundering suspicions, similar to those levelled against Flutterwave and Korapay.\n\nAbout four Kenyans were named as directors in these companies, and the KRA showed that this company could be involved in a larger and more complex money laundering scheme. South African company, OIT Africa was also among the companies with frozen accounts in Kenya.\n\nThe directors of RemX capital were also of Kenyan origin, and the entire series of allegations have featured Kenyans and Nigerians working in tandem.\n\nSo why has Nigeria stolen the limelight\n\nFlutterwave CEO, Gbenga Agboola, alluded to the imminent elections in Kenya as a possible reason for what seems to be a witchhunt of Nigerian companies.\n\nOther sources close to these fintech companies cautiously agree, stating that a sure-fire way to get people united during an election is to unite against a common, albeit, imaginary enemy.\n\nWhile the political undertones are not clear, reports that featured RemX Capital and Multigate Limited also claimed these companies were backed by a powerful Kenyan politician that remained unnamed for legal reasons.\n\nThe counterargument against this notion is that the investigations have seemingly started since 2020, and the ARA alleges that these companies are linked.\n\nHowever, if there\u2019s reason to believe that opposition parties are bringing funds into the country, the recent moves from the ARA would make sense.\n\nWhile there might be political undertones, we can take a progressive spin to this conversation.\n\nCross-border fintechs vs regulations\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from\n\nSince all companies have denied these allegations, and investigations are still ongoing, it would be imprudent to jump to conclusions. If you\u2019ve been following the startup space, you\u2019d observe that companies use technologies to exploit loopholes in regulations.\n\nThe now-defunct motorcycle hailing companies of Lagos found theirs with the government\u2019s permitted bike capacity, solar companies are producing lower wattage mini-grids in high volumes to skirt around the regulatory limits, while digital banks acquire a state-level microfinance bank licence that allows them to operate nationwide with the aid of technology.\n\nAn investor with deep knowledge of Kenya\u2019s fintech space states the Kenyan government has actually been supportive of fintechs, so the recent moves have been quite surprising.\n\nIf the country of origin is irrelevant and not all fintechs are facing the ire of the ARA, it would be helpful to note what these fintechs have in common. All the fintechs in question are all operating some form of cross-border payment service. Either with cards or remittance.\n\nInterestingly, you\u2019d find that the cross-border payments space in Africa has been historically difficult, and legacy companies like Western Union and Moneygram have to constantly deal with tough regulations, making sub-Saharan Africa the most expensive region for you to send money to other countries.\n\nWhile most reports have focused on individuals sending money, what they haven\u2019t shown is how much more difficult it is for companies running global operations from these companies to manage payments and move funds across borders.\n\nEnter fintech companies looking to play in the cross-border payments space and make things significantly easier for Africans to send money to and from the continent. Flutterwave has established a presence in 33 African countries for B2B payments, Korapay, which recently expanded to the UK, Kandon Technologies, and Multigate Limited also help businesses manage funds across geographies, and different currencies.\n\nSo when you narrow things down, the ARA\u2019s suspicion is seemingly targeted at companies playing in the B2B cross-border payments service. For such companies, huge amounts of funds would have to be moved.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that large amounts of money are moved by our businesses does not make it money laundering and demonstrates a lack of understanding of our business model,\u201d says Multigate in a public statement to Nairametrics.\n\nConsidering Africa\u2019s tough regulatory environment, it\u2019s hardly surprising that they\u2019ve chosen to move money through weird routes that have raised the suspicion of the ARA regarding money laundering.\n\nLet\u2019s take Flutterwave, for example, which settles transactions for a global ride-hailing company, Uber, in Nigeria. The company collects payments from customers in naira but would sometimes need to settle a merchant like Uber in naira.\n\nIn Nigeria, the CBN has constantly implemented stringent measures to limit access to foreign exchanges, and that has become a huge issue. Consequently, the company would have to make use of partners in countries with similarly developed and FX friendly policies. That\u2019s were Kenya comes in.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\n\nA critical point the ARA made was that all the companies were linked in a complex money laundering scheme. While I could continue playing devil\u2019s advocate and put it down to fintechs collaborating, conversations I had yesterday and raised up further weirdness.\n\nWhile the ARA linked Korapay to Flutterwave, I gathered from an off-the-books interview that both companies have not had a transaction in Kenya.\n\nYes, both companies had no official transactions, but business daily reports allege that Flutterwave made payments to Boxtrip capital, a company registered by Enyioma Olufemi Madubuike who\u2019s the Chief Compliance and Legal Officer of Korapay. Efforts to reach him have proved abortive. Some funds were also transferred to other companies registered to individuals with ties other companies.\n\nWhile I\u2019m careful not to draw any conclusions from this, it shows that the ARA probably has good cause to be suspicious of such account activities. It\u2019s also another wake-up call for fintechs to rethink their approach to compliance and regulations.\n\n\u201cIf a licensed company in Nigeria sends a certain sum of money to a Kenyan account, the initial reactions shouldn\u2019t be money laundering. The ARA should, at least call the company to ask them what the transaction is for,\u201d a source argues.\n\nAccording to our source, the ARA\u2019s approach has created room for extortion of the respective companies, even though no clear case of money laundering has been stated beyond money entering an account.\n\nIn Korapay\u2019s case, the company reported that the money the ARA froze was meant to acquire a payment licence to operate in Kenya. Apparently, the money has reportedly been sitting in the said account since 2021.\n\nWe were able to obtain documents from the CBK that showed all the amounts needed to obtain a payments license in Kenya, and when we added up everything, it amounted to $250,000, the same amount of money that was frozen in Korapay\u2019s accounts.\n\nAs for the amounts Flutterwave transferred to the likes of Boxtrip travels limited, Bagtrip travels limited, and Rainbow technology solutions, we could make reference to Nigeria\u2019s FX difficulties once more, a tell-tale sign that these companies must be part of a loophole to bypass the CBN\u2019s tight ship.\n\nThis example of regulators freezing accounts was seen last year with Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission and Chaka Technologies. It could be a sign for regulatory tightening, instead of the unpleasant narratives currently ongoing in several quarters.\n\nAlso, even if the companies are not engaged in anything on towards, we have to recognise that making cross-border transactions seamless for honest customers also could also mean seamless transactions for dishonest actors constantly looking to exploit financial loopholes.\n\nThe companies could also be in cahoots with these actors as we found with Ping express, a US cross-border payments startup whose founders were jailed for facilitating the proceeds of romance scams in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria reported the 2nd highest number of cyberattacks, and it has reported massive losses to fraud. On a global stage, it\u2019s a similar story, with $28 billion lost to card fraud alone.\n\nThe details of this story are far from over, and I\u2019ve refrained from disclosing some key information I can\u2019t yet confirm. Watch this space for constant updates. You can also catch up with us on Twitter by 7 pm on Friday, July 22, 2022, to discuss compliance as a fintech founder.",

          "title": "Nigerian fintechs grapple with KYC amid rapid growth",
          "text": "Nigerian financial technology companies are grappling with the aftermath of a Kenyan court account freeze order and a decision by a Texas court to jail the founders of Ping Express over money laundering.\n\nThe charges against the four fintech companies are the most money laundering allegations the fintech ecosystem in Nigeria has seen in a month and could have ramifications for the image of startups in the country looking for investors abroad.\n\nExperts say that henceforth many startups will be compelled to focus on strengthening lax Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) practices.\n\nKYC refers to due diligence that banks and other financial institutions must perform on their customers before doing business with them to prevent corruption, identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering and terrorism financing, according to Fraud.net.\n\n\u201cAML and KYC requirements are more or less the same globally. I however opine that with the many finance and technology innovations, they should be reviewed and scope broadened to include all emerging, and continuously emerging innovations,\u201d said Evalyn Gachoki, a fintech law practitioner.\n\nWhile Anslem Oshionebo and Opeyemi Odeyale, Nigerian founders of Ping Express, a Texas-based fintech company, pleaded guilty on Saturday to failing to adequately guard against money laundering in a court in the Northern District of Texas, Flutterwave, Korapay, and Kandor are battling for access to their accounts frozen by the Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) of Kenya.\n\nFlutterwave is the most affected, with 56 accounts it has with Guaranty Trust Bank (29 accounts), Equity Bank (17), and Ecobank (six) all frozen. The 56 accounts held about $56 million.\n\nKorapay Technologies had one of its accounts with $249,565 frozen, while two accounts worth a combined $126,841 belonging to Kandor Technologies also suffered the same fate.\n\nAlthough the tech companies insist that they followed due process and every KYC practice, experts say cases of money laundering usually happen because someone may have ignored KYC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d argue poor KYC exposes them to fraud and non-compliance on AML,\u201d said Victoria Crandal, a tech PR expert and founder of No Filter PR. \u201cFintechs prioritise growth and user experience and KYC becomes an after-thought. This partly explains the fraud within MTN\u2019s PSB and possibly FW (Flutterwave) alleged AML problems in Kenya.\u201d\n\nVictor Asemota, chairman of Edo Innovates, has a slightly different opinion. According to him, KYC is not a fintech problem because the government owns identification. Since fintechs do not control identification, they have to prioritise KYC.\n\n\u201cWe have helped MTN do AML on their mobile payments platforms for a decade. They take it extremely seriously; same with Flutterwave. Misunderstanding by regulators of settlement occurs. Tech glitches are a reality,\u201d Asemota said.\n\nOther experts say anti-money laundering issues arise when tech startups try to outsmart the regulator. For example, merchant transactions are facilitated through merchant category codes (MCC).\n\nAn MCC is a four-digit number used by credit card companies to classify businesses. A business that sells both services and products will typically reflect the business type that makes up the dominant amount of sales. Businesses can request additional MCC for a different part of a business. For example, a pharmaceutical store that has a grocery store in one location would likely have different MCCs within the same building.\n\nEvery merchant has a unique ID and every transaction has a code. There are codes that when merchants are initiating transactions, they raise a red flag, like gambling, and pornography. Usually, the Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) is supposed to know when a merchant is making a particular transaction.\n\nHowever, there are cases of abuse. Merchants that want to help people move funds would simply change the code from which the transaction is originating and use another code that diverts attention. While some companies often get away with it, others do not.\n\nThe anti-money laundering policy is usually strong in many countries including Nigeria where the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit is in charge of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism; however, there are jurisdictions where the enforcement is stricter.\n\nKenya happens to be one of them, according to several people knowledgeable about the issue. Patrick Ngugi Njoroge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, said at a conference organised by Visa in April that the country was intensifying compliance as part of measures to strengthen the financial system of the country.\n\nThe country, in September 2021, gazetted the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-money Laundering Bill, which seeks to amend the current Proceeds of Crime and Anti-money Laundering Act, 2009.\n\nThe bill expands the definition of \u201creporting persons\u201d under the Act. This will now include advocates, notaries, and other independent legal professionals who are sole practitioners, partners, or employees within professional firms so that the obligations to monitor complex unusual, suspicious, large, or other transactions and to report any transactions that constitute or may be related to money laundering as provided under Part IV of the Act apply to them.\n\nThe bill also seeks to give the centre the authority to interrupt a transaction for not more than five working days where there is evidence of suspicious activity taking place. This will allow the centre adequate time to investigate the transaction.\n\nThe bill also seeks to introduce provisions that will limit the right to privacy enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 in relation to the prevention, detection, and investigation of money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\nAccording to a legal compliance professional who spoke to BusinessDay on condition of anonymity, the existing Kenyan anti-money laundering law allows ARA to hold on to the funds in the frozen accounts pending when it has concluded investigations. This could mean 45 days at the lower court and 90 days at the higher court.\n\n\u201cThis whole area is confusing, to be honest. The startups are not entirely guilt-free. But it\u2019s not as simple as Nigerian founders doing fraud. They are not that stupid. The reality is there are a lot of loopholes in corridors outside of their control. KYC is set by the government mostly.\n\nBVN, NIN, and ID cards all come from the government. If the government doesn\u2019t tighten up its process, people will take advantage and the result will reflect on the fintechs processing value,\u201d said Henry Ojuor, founder in residence with Startupbootcamp, a global startup and innovation accelerator for startups, corporates, and governments.\n\nRead also: How to Leverage Happy Customers to Promote Your Brand\n\nA tech expert who wants to remain anonymous, told BusinessDay that enforcement often depends on the regulatory focus of the jurisdiction in cross-border payments.\n\n\u201cDespite the strides achieved by Nigerian fintech firms, you can hardly get public data on their activities from the CBN or NIBSS.\n\nThe incentives driving Nigerian fintechs, and possible lax domestic regulations, may not be tolerated in jurisdictions that are strict. The allegation against the affected firms is not unique to Nigerian fintech, and dare I say, not borne out of envy,\u201d the expert said.\n\nWhile the companies continue to proclaim their innocence, a bigger challenge they face is how to access the funds in those accounts.\n\nFor companies like Flutterwave, the more days the funds spend in ARA\u2019s custody, the worse the anger of merchants they have to deal with.\n\n\u201cThese funds do not belong to these companies. They are given to them by merchants, and there is a limit to how long a patient can be patient with you,\u201d the compliance officer said.\n\nKandon Technologies, in its statement, described itself as a liquidity management startup offering treasury solutions, alternative trading, and related financial services. The company said it has facilitated transactions for a host of its partners doing legitimate businesses and it has records of these transactions, which are available and can be verified.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we have always adhered to applicable regulatory requirements in our transactions and engaged with regulatory bodies to stay compliant,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe pledge to continue working with regulatory bodies and all relevant stakeholders to prove our innocence and straighten the records.\u201d\n\nKorapay, on its part, said it deposited the funds in its freshly opened bank account as a capital requirement from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) for obtaining a payment service provider and remittance operator licence. In line with the CBK requirements, this amount was left untouched pending the granting of the licence. The company claimed that the $250,000 deposit is the only transaction carried out on that account to date.\n\nOne of the options being explored by the companies includes filing a legal action asking the court to compel ARA to put the funds in accounts or assets that yield interest and allow them access to the interest to enable them to fulfill their obligations to their merchants.\n\nEvalyn Gachoki said government agencies like ARA need to engage fintech experts, regulators, and stakeholders towards identifying gaps, if any.\n\n\u201cAnti-money laundering laws were created way before fintech was birthed. The laws should be reviewed to incorporate the many solutions technology has introduced into finance,\u201d Gachoki said.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe defeat of Governor Oyetola in Osun 2022 election is a big blessing to APC as well as a wakeup call to all those concerned. Those with the mindset of too much confidence should be careful. It was an embarrassment to Osun electorates for Governor Oyetola to blame Aregbesola for abandoning governance and developmental projects in Osun State. The defeat of Oyetola will reposition Osun APC to win future elections. His defeat will facilitate the conduct of local government election by the next administration. The result of the election showed that God has answered the prayer of most people in Osun State for power to shift to Osun West senatorial zone.\n\nGovernor Oyetola abandoned the Cocoa Products Industry Nigeria Limited in Ede, the first company to produce chocolate in Nigeria (SKYRUN COCOA FACTORY) has suspended its operations. The Cocoa Products Industry Nigeria Limited in Ede, (SKYRUN COCOA FACTORY) had suspended its operations. The set of Chinese running the company abandoned it in 2018. Currently, the facilities at the company are being used as stores for COVID-19 relief items donated to the State Government of Osun. It would be recalled that the company was revived by the Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola administration after 15-years of being in moribund state.\n\nWith the high level of impunity and manipulations involved in the month of May APC primaries and shenanigans engaged to get rid of some people, the joke has now turned to defeat. Governor Oyetola\u2019s group, as all its aspirants in various constituencies are laying claims to victory and confirming it with concocted figures aimed to suite their fraud. It is unheard of, and even a shameful experience, that four and three days after the primaries have been held, the governor and his collaborators in the party are unable to declare the winners in the contests. The results sheets were written in Governor Gboyega Oyetola office and the results sheets were filled with the names of the governor\u2019s cronies who never won the primary elections.\n\nNo fewer than 10 aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Osun State, had jointly called for the cancellation of the House of Assembly and National Assembly primary elections of the party, which they described as a sham. The aspirants, who were made up of 10 for House of Assembly and two for House of Representatives, pointed accusing fingers on Governor of Osun State, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, and alleged acts of impunity and total disregard to democratic principles on the conduct of the primaries. The aspirants contended that the direct primaries were conducted without any election material or party document like membership register, result sheets, among others.\n\nIn 2018, the agitation for the OSUN WEST SENATORIAL DISTRICT to produce the next Governor was fierce and huge. It was so fierce that all party leaders, starting from the elders, Agba Osun caucus of APC, majority of the State Executive Council, virtually all organs of the party were hell bent on \u201cWEST LOKAN AGENDA.\u201d In spite of this clamour, the then Chief of Staff, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola, was produced as the APC candidate for the State Gubernatorial Election.\n\nThat decision alone fragmented the party such that a section of the party decamped to ADP, costing APC at least 49,000 votes in the 2018 election. Eventually, the election was declared INCONCLUSIVE and a RERUN was ordered, with Alhaji Oyetola eventually winning with a slim margin. Although, many factors were responsible for the declaration of the election being INCONCLUSIVE, among which was the decamping of aggrieved section of APC Members to the ADP party \u2013 costing APC over 49,000 votes, the unpopularity of the APC\u2019s fielded candidate as well as the general clamour for OSUN WEST DISTRICT to field the next Governor were the driving factors for APC\u2019s unusually slim victory in the 2018 Huber elections.\n\nInstead of considering the above factors as the main factors responsible for the declaration of the election INCONCLUSIVE, Governor Oyetola , from the inception of his administration embarked on a campaign of calumny and politics of division within the Party. Under the Oyetola administration, whoever is perceived to be associated with or harbour any interest in the legacy of immediate past administration or commitment to his predecessor is alienated from the party and government regardless of their contribution to the success of the party.\n\nGovernor Oyetola used his position as a member of the Caretaker Extraordinary and Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC with the support of Senator Iyiola Omisore, to influence the Chairman of the Osun Convention planning committee, Hon. Elegbeleye to declare the Governor\u2019s group consensus list as duly elected ward Executives; TOP then petitioned the National Secretariat in the form of an appeal and eventually the Appeal Committee came, they were equally compromised by the Governor, using his influence as a member of CECPC. But one significant thing about the Appeal was during its sitting, known thugs from the Governor\u2019s group came to disrupt the proceedings.\n\nDigging deeper into the unpopularity of the candidate, If we compare the results of Alhaji Isiaka Gboyega Oyetola in his home local governments and that of his closest rival, the PDP in his home Local Governments, we will discover the huge difference of 21,525 votes in favour of PDP. This is significant, considering the fact that, PDP could only lead APC after the first ballot by only 353 votes.\n\nA former governor of Osun State and current Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, said his successor, Adegboyega Oyetola, waged a war against him after becoming the governor. Aregbesola spoke in Ikire while addressing a rally held to garner support for his anointed candidate for governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress, Moshood Adeoti.\n\nSpeaking in Yoruba language, Aregbesola said he pleaded with Oyetola for about two years not to fight him, adding that his successor rejected his advice, which made him to call his supporters to salvage the party. He said, \u201cI begged him (Oyetola) for two years; I told him that people must not mock us; I told him that he was heading for destruction. I served this state with the whole of my heart; I also positioned Oyetola so that he could succeed me in office.\n\nI told my successor not to destroy my legacies, says ex-gov \u201cWhen we came to this town (Ikire) for his campaign, we were drenched in rain from the Akire\u2019s palace to this place. He got to the office and claimed I am his enemy; those who contested against him during our party primary he pulled closer, while he fights me. \u201cSince Oyetola assumes office, he has waged a war against me as if I once harmed him. He claimed that I did not want him to emerge as the governor; I told him that I heard him and that now that he had been governor, what else did he want?\n\n\u201cI begged him for two years; I sent people to help me beg him and that he should not love me, but he must not fight me; even if he wanted to fight me, he should not abuse me and destroy my legacies. \u201cAll that I warned him not to do was what he did. He opposed what I did; all the things I did together with him for eight years, he opposed and reversed them. He thought he can destroy me through my work; nobody was pushing him, he is pushing himself. He deliberately towed that path. He waged a war against me and refused to listen to my pleas until he got rid of me.\u201d\n\nGovernor Oyetola used a coalition of civil society organisations in Osun State to petitioned the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to sack or redeploy the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, for \u201cabdicating his primary responsibilities for petty political fights\u201d and for \u201cpromoting inter-agency war\u201d and using \u201cgovernment paraphernalia for the prosecution of political battles.\u201d\n\nThe coalition comprises the Osun Masterminds, Transparency and Accountability Group, Centre for Sustainable Dialogue, Centre for Democratic Ethics, Oodua Youth Parliament, Osun Young Professionals, Nigerians for Good Governance, Nigeria Youths Representatives Council and Gender Tonic Initiative. In the petition delivered to the Presidency, the coalition said, \u201cIf the Federal Government under the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), fails to caution Mr Rauf Aregbesola and charge him to focus on his official responsibilities instead of going about causing civil unrest, he will end up inflaming the otherwise peaceful Osun State.\n\n______________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Osogbo\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has said the forthcoming presidential election is a \u201cmust win\u201d for his party to bring jobs, education, food, medicine and hope among others.\n\nTinubu also defended his choice of former Borno state Governor Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate, saying he remained unwavering in his belief that the lawmaker is \u201cthe very best person to run for office and to, hopefully, govern by my side.\u201d\n\nThe event had in attendance about 30 clerics, one of whom said the Body of Christ should be differentiated from political parties.\n\nSpeaking at the official unveiling of Kashim Shettima as his running mate Wednesday at the Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre Abuja, Tinubu said he believed Nigeria\u2019s diversity is her strength and \u201cwe must be victorious in order to achieve the greatness of which this country is capable.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery election brings with it the promise of renewed hope. This one shall be no different. For our party and for our nation, we hold the chance to move the nation and our collective cause forward as never before.\n\n\u201cWe must be wise of thought and courageous of action. We must win this election so that we can bring jobs, education, food, medicine, hope and belief in a better life to the people of this country.\u201d\n\nThe former Lagos state governor also said: \u201cMy decisions regarding the team around and supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\n\u201cThis chapter in our nation\u2019s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach. In selecting Senator Shettima I have committed myself to this path. I have made the hard choice because I believe it is the best choice.\n\n\u201cThis is where politics must end and leadership must begin. True Leadership is not grounded in religion, populism or sentiment. To forge ahead as a nation toward development and prosperity, we must break free of old binds.\n\n\u201cSenator Kashim Shettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the Vice President. As a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism he has my implicit confidence and faith.\u201d\n\n\u2026Ticket not sectional- Shettima\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Senator Shettima declared that his joint ticket with Tinubu \u201cisn\u2019t an imposition; it\u2019s an outcome of democracy at its practical best, and based on the aggregation of the ideas and insights.\n\n\u201cIf this were an unpopular option, as the cast of partisan provocateurs has attempted to paint, there wouldn\u2019t have been the tonnes of goodwill messages, especially from distinguished Christians, from all over the country. This ticket is a Nigerian project, not a sectional agenda that the frightened camps have been struggling to sensationalize.\u201d\n\nThe former Borno state governor further said: \u201cMy emergence as the running mate of the inimitable Jagaban Borgu, is based on the party\u2019s very forthright assessment of the threats ahead; and I\u2019m most honoured by the consensus of the distinguished stakeholders of our party, to trust me, with representing the nation\u2019s interests, under the leadership of the very sage, the youths all over our country, fondly refer to as \u201cCity Boy\u201d, in honour of his cosmopolitan profile.\n\n\u201cToday, I must also testify to the cyclical nature of history. But, like those before us, we must resist the temptation to throw a feast, over an invitation to serve the people. We must always take the past as our finest teacher, one never to be taken for granted. This would guide our staring into tomorrow. I\u2019m not unaware of the difficult political arithmetic that produced this moment, especially the understanding of our great Party\u2019s stakeholders and supporters, across religions, regions, and ethnicities. Their resolve to settle for this ticket is a testament to the faith they have in us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sincerely proud of the rational citizens, who view this, as nothing but a pragmatic permutation, to defeat our opponents at the polls, and based on acknowledgment and implementation of the candid perspectives of our Christian brothers and sisters in the APC, who, like us, are bound by the passion for us to retain power, in order to deepen the delivery of unifying and transformative governance, to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShettima promised \u201cto work with commitment for all Nigerians, especially the youths, give a firm assurance that no discrimination of any form will arise, from this patriotic alliance for the deepening of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cI want to assure our teeming supporters that, in the coming days, we will be rolling out our plans for a greater Nigeria, and pointing towards the bright future that we envisage; and away from the destination of those with nothing, but mudslinging to market, as the reason they deserve to be elected. Such hollow strategies shouldn\u2019t be the ideals of a nation, yearning for an experienced and documented visionary, like Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, at the wheels.\u201d\n\n\u2026Adamu cautions\n\nWhile officially unveiling Shettima, National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who recalled how the nation witnessed Muslim-Muslim ticket during the 1993 presidential election, said Nigeria needed men and women of character, competence and demonstrable evidence of their performance in public or private offices and not religious sentiment.\n\n\u201cSenator Shettima brings to the joint ticket impressive antecedents as a political leader and administrator. Senator Tinubu could not have made a better choice of a running mate. He chose a man he believes can partner with him to undertake the urgent task of our economic recovery as well as social and political development in peace and security,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nAdamu, however, warned the APC against disunity, saying the party leaders must purge themselves of the bitterness arising from our individual losses in the party primaries.\n\n\u201cThe unveiling of the vice-presidential candidate today sends out a strong signal to the country that our great party is ready and united around the common cause of coasting home with victory at every level in 2023. But we must not be unmindful of the hurdles ahead.\n\n\u201cIt is time to purge ourselves of the bitterness arising from our individual losses in the party primaries. It is time to submit ourselves to the Will of God and the party and do nothing to sabotage its well-laid plans for victory. The other political parties want what we want, and that is, to win and form the next government.\n\n\u201cIf by any acts of omission or commission we give in to bitterness and pettiness or fail to see the larger picture or take any of the political parties for granted, we would constitute an obstacle to the victory of our party. As the faithful would like to say, that will not be our portion. Our winning strategy must be anchored on a unity of purpose. I urge us to begin our march now towards the sunrise,\u201d the party\u2019s nation al chairman also said.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi state, Atiku Bagudu, described Shettima as one of the Nigeria\u2019s finest, adding that the nation\u2019s \u2018s hope has resonated since Tinubu was announced as the APC presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cHe is undoubtedly the Nigeria\u2019s candidate,\u201d Bagudu said.\n\n\u2026Bishops, pastors attend\n\nMeanwhile, contrary to position of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) which rejected the ticket, a coalition of Bishops and some pastors showed up at the Musa Yar\u2019Adu Centre, venue of the unveiling of APC vice presidential candidate.\n\nThe Christian clerics, about 30 of them, were seen dressed in their cassock.\n\nThe Christian body Tuesday issued an official statement to reject any political party that settled for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nSpeaking newsmen, one of the clerics who identified himself as Bishop Oguba said he was not aware CAN had taken any position on the Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cIf CAN has taken a decision, I am not aware of it and the body has not communicated to me in writing over the decision to oppose Muslim-Muslim joint presidential ticket. I am surprised you are asking me about the decision of CAN. My ministry is duly registered with Corporate Affairs Commission. I am not just running a ministry.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter about Muslim-Muslim ticket is an issue I have tried to call the attention of all clergies to differentiate whether we are politicians or servants of God. As far as I am concerned, the body of Christ is not a political party.\n\n\u201cSo, if APC decided to adopt Muslim-Muslim ticket, I have no business with that. What concerns me is the economy of the country and I will continue to advise all the clergies in this country not to use their selfish interest to bring down the economy of this country because the economy is greater than all religions in this country.\n\n\u201cThe clergies should be concerned about the security of the country not the same faith ticket by any political party. It is purely the decision of the political parties and CAN must take a stand, they would have gotten our addresses with CAC and send circulars to us over their decision.\u201d\n\n\u2026Anti-Muslim-Muslim protest thickens\n\nIn a related development, hundreds of protesters Wednesday stormed the national secretariat of the APC to register their grievance over the position of the party on the contentious Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe protest took place almost at the same time the leadership of the APC was unveiling Shettima at the Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre Abuja as Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe demonstration, which was led by few party members under the aegis of APC Hausa-Fulani Youth Forum, saw the delegation arrived the APC national secretariat in six luxury buses and few cars, raising different banners and chanting solidarity songs.\n\nSome of the banners read \u2018A cry for justice\u2019, \u2018Drop Shettima and give slot to our Christian brothers\u2019, \u2018Discrimination and mutual suspicion in our country\u2019 among others.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, Convener of the Forum, Abdullahi Bilal Mohamadu, said they would not stop protesting until the party does the right.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the party\u2019s national chairman, Mohammadu stated that they saw Shetiima\u2019s selection as an aberration that should be corrected immediately by the leadership of the party.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe write to your good office in light of the prevailing circumstances arising from the decision of our Presidential candidate to select a Northern Muslim as his vice presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile it must be stated that there is a right to make decisions, however, such decisions must not be made to the collective detriment of the sensibilities of the people that make up the country of Nigeria especially at a time of mutual suspicion amongst the Christians and Muslims in the northern part of the country.\n\n\u201cAs concerned stakeholders of the APC and those who constitute the voting strength of our party, we find it worrisome that such a decision could be taken without recourse to its implication on the electoral chances of the party and the attendant uproar such a decision could bring about in the country.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, this is insensitive and a gross display of a lack of respect for our Christian brothers and sisters especially the Middle Belt minority who have given all their best to us as one northern Nigeria. Picking another Muslim from the north eastern part of the country as his running mate is politically and morally indefensible.\n\n\u201cIn Northern Nigeria, there are credible candidates with rich credentials and with massive grassroots following that can complement the presidential ticket of the APC in the presidential elections. As such, the Hausa \u2013 Fulani Youths Forum sees the selection of Senator Kashim Shettima as an aberration that should be corrected with immediate effect by the relevant authorities within the party.\n\n\u201cThe implication of non-action in this regard can only be imagined, so much so that the majority of the eligible voters in Northern Nigeria have elected to boycott the APC in protest of the disrespect and disregard to our Northern Christian brothers, whose population and relevance in the scheme of things in the region cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cIf our party is desirous of recording electoral success in the 2023 presidential elections, it must retrace its steps by selecting a Christian from the Middle Belt as its vice presidential candidate. The party must not be perceived as promoting a religious agenda by fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cWe consequently say no to a Muslim-Muslim ticket by the APC. We call on President Muhammadu Buhari to kindly intervene to save the party from an electoral crisis. We urge Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to emulate the example of President Muhammadu Buhari in the choice of his running mate in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections.\n\n\u201cOur Christian brothers and sisters deserve a place in the scheme of things, and our party must not be seen as a religiously insensitive party. The time to act is now.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The federal government Wednesday said the planned street protest by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in solidarity with the striking members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is illegal.\n\nFielding questions from State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the decision of the NLC to join the strike would create anarchy\n\nHe said it\u2019s illegal for the union to embark on a protest because the congress has no dispute with the federal government.\n\nHe said as the umbrella body of workers\u2019 unions and associations, there was the need for the NLC to detach itself from politics.\n\n\u201cWe should also start to interrogate what labour is doing. The NLC is not a political party. The NLC can go on strike or protest if the rights of NLC members are involved. What the NLC is planning in the next two days is about interest.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no dispute whatsoever between NLC as a body with the federal government. Well yes, there\u2019s a dispute between some members of NLC, ASUU and the federal government which is being looked into.\n\n\u201cAnd NLC itself is a party to the committee that is looking into the solution. So, calling out people on street protest you begin to wonder, what is the motive of NLC in this matter?\n\n\u201cBut you see here, we do not interrogate what NLC is doing. NLC by its own laws, cannot even give out pamphlets. And NLC is supposed to be completely insulated from politics.\n\n\u201cNow, if you declare dispute with us, yes you can go on strike. Even that one would depend on whether certain steps have been taken or not. But this particular NLC, you know, asking and mobilising people to come out on strike on July 26 and 27, is clearly on nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nReminded that members of the NLC were worried about the prolonged strike which was also affecting their children, the minister said: \u201cThe federal government is as worried as NLC and everybody, but the law is the law. What we are saying is that rather than that, what I expect NLC to do as an umbrella body is to find solution, to join federal government in finding solution.\n\n\u201cThey are parts of the tripartite agreement that have been negotiating with federal government on this ASUU issue. So why are they now going out to take sides? I think you should also interrogate it yourselves.\n\n\u201cI think it is popular to get NLC out and support but ask yourself how does that help the problem? How does that solve the problem? What you are going to create is more anarchy. And I think the NLC should think twice about their proposed strike in solidarity with ASUU.\u201d\n\nSirika\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika said the threat by workers in the aviation industry to shut down airports in solidarity with ASUU would have grave implications on national security.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m naturally concerned about this if the aviation union will shut down in support of ASUU. I would say they have no need to. I will say also that we should begin to look at civil aviation as a critical national security enterprise. It has all the implications.\n\n\u201cWe should not contemplate or think about an aviation disaster. We should also think about the general activity on the economy of Nigeria without civil aviation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. This is democracy, you can push for demands, but in pressing for demands you should be reasonable in doing so. Where, the life that you\u2019re trying to promote, would be seriously affected and hampered, where lives can be lost because of your own activity, I think it should be reconsidered.\n\n\u201cSo, civil aviation workers, I think should not be part of this. Yes, I am concerned and yes we\u2019ve spoken to them and I don\u2019t think they will join because they know that there\u2019s huge responsibility of lives on their heads. If you\u2019re an air traffic controller, it involves national security. It involves the capability of preventing external aggression and so on so forth.\n\n\u201cI believe that they are very aware of the enormous responsibility upon them in civil aviation and they should continue to see it so and continue to be as law abiding as we want them to be,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige said President Muhammadu Buhari never ordered him to hands off negotiations with the striking varsity lecturers.\n\nBriefing State House correspondents, the minister said: \u201cThe truth of the matter is there is no such thing, it\u2019s just categorically untrue. There is nothing like hands off.\u201d\n\nAsked if the two-week directive by the president to resolve the issue is achievable, the minister said he had proposed one week to resolve the issue but the Minister of Education, Mr Adamu Adamu, volunteered to resolve the issues with ASUU in two weeks.\n\nThe minister said he hopes the issues would be resolved at the stipulated time.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026 Says Bayelsa Airport Is Not Downgraded\n\nBy Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Bayelsa State Government has made a clarification that the state-owned international airport had not been downgraded, as being insinuated in some quarters.\n\nHe said the absence of scheduled flights to and from the Bayelsa International Airport for a couple of weeks now was not the making or fault of the state government, but has to do with some technical issues with the two airline operators.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, gave the clarification on Wednesday when the Federated Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Bayelsa State Council, paid him a courtesy call in Government House, Yenagoa.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo explained that two airlines, Ibom-Air and United Nigeria Airlines, were carrying out what he called D-Check on their aircraft, which had also affected their flight operations from their primary routes.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Governor, the D-Check is a major maintenance check to determine the air-worthiness of an aircraft after it had made commercial flights for a period of 10 years.\n\nHe pointed out that the state government was in touch with the management teams of both airlines, giving the assurance that normal flight operations would resume at the airport before the end of the month.\n\nHis words: \u201cI can assure you that the Governor Diri-led Administration is very much on course. I know that you are going to ask us what is happening to the Bayelsa International Airport.\n\n\u201cThere are a few issues, but they are not really our issues as a government per se. We are aware some persons are pushing the news that the airport has been downgraded. That is not true. The Bayelsa Airport has not been downgraded.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is that the two airlines working with us have gone for D-Check. The D-Check means a plane going for a major maintenance check after it had been put to flight operations for 10 years to determine its airworthiness.\n\n\u201cIf you watch very well, even flights in their regular or primary routes, like the Port Harcourt to Abuja route, have now been reduced to only one daily flight.\u201d\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, who noted that government was doing its best to change the general impression of leadership in the state, said the administration had taken proactive steps to checkmate the impact of the forecast impending large flood.\n\nHe called on the Federated Correspondents Chapel to help push out the good things government was doing in Bayelsa, noting that the Prosperity Administration was not resting on its oars in all sectors ranging from agriculture, sports, health to security.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, thanked the media for their support to the present administration right from its inception to date and assured the Chapel that government would support their annual lecture slated for November this year.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, however, observed that the standard of journalistic practice was in a steady decline in Nigeria, and therefore, called on the Correspondents Chapel and its parent body, the Nigeria Union of Journalists, to raise the bar.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the state Chairman of the Federated Correspondents Chapel, NUJ, Mr. Tife Owolabi, said the visit was meant to formally introduce the newly elected executive members of the Chapel to the Deputy Governor.\n\nMr. Owolabi, who poured encomiums on the Deputy Governor for being media friendly, prayed the state\u2019s government to carry the correspondents chapel along in its programmes and events, even as he appealed for support towards their annual lecture programme.",

          "text": "By Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Niger Delta Development Commission, (NDDC) has launched a novel Niger Delta Talent Hunt (NIDETH) to harness creativity among youths in the entertainment industry and address unemployment in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe Interim Administrator, NDDC, Dr. Efiong Akwa, who spoke on Wednesday during the inauguration of the programme at the NDDC headquarters in Port Harcourt said it was designed to tackle the challenges and lack of opportunities facing youths in the region.\n\nDr. Akwa commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Mr. Umana Okon Umana, for supporting activities aimed at harnessing the creative potential of youths in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe entertainment industry is growing bigger everyday. The Nollywood industry occupies a major platform amongst other entertainment industries in the world. When you talk of entertainment the next thing you hear is Nollywood industry in Nigeria. Niger Delta is blessed.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to tell the world that youths of the Niger Delta are the best you can find around the world. They are calm, confident, they seek to excel in whatever endeavour they find themselves.\n\n\u201cIn the field of soccer the youths of Rivers State and Akwa-Ibom are taking the lead; wrestling, Delta and Edo are tops; swimming Bayelsa and Rivers are unbeatable.\n\n\u201cOur focus in this programme is to identify the talented youths, build them up and expose them to the world. We want to use this as an opportunity to provide a platform to expose the hidden talents in the region. If you build the youth, you build the nation.\u201d\n\nDr. Akwa\u2019s Special Adviser on Youths, Engr. Udengs Eradiri, described the Niger Delta youths as enterprising, observing that artistes from the region had challenges of getting support and platforms to express themselves.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe creative industry is one area that we can engage a lot of idle young people. We will continue to play our role in supporting institutions to create the platform to push our young people to the international community. We must keep the creative sector alive in the Niger Delta to develop young talents and to showcase them to the world.\n\n\u201cWe expect that after this process, we will be able to identify unique talents that would be able to showcased to the world. If you look at the entertainment industry you have employment opportunities that are waiting for us.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta youths need to be a part of these opportunities. We need to create engagements so that young people, who have a lot of energy can channel it towards talent development. The work of the NDDC is that of an interventionist agency. It is part of our job to create opportunities for young people to express themselves.\n\n\u201cThe sky is our starting point. We expect that after this talent hunt which is geared towards entertainment, we will be looking at sports\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the NDDC Director, Youths and Sports, Mr. Offiong Ephraim, said that NIDETH was a flagship programme of the NDDC Youths and Sports Directorate aimed at exposing the inherent talents in the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe said the talent hunt programme would kick off from the first phase which is Ondo, Edo and Delta State and followed by the other phases with the grand finale taking place in Port Harcourt, Rivers State noting that it would cover the nine states of the Niger Delta Region.\n\nOne of the leading artistes in the region and consultant for the programme, Mr. Okiri Harrison, also known as Harry Song, said that the new NDDC youth programme was a dream come true for those in the creative sector.\n\nHe said that 80 per cent of the entertainment industry was rooted in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe musician said: \u201cIn the entertainment industry, cutting across music, comedy and theatre, the top talents are from the Niger Delta region. The main issue is that most talents remain unharnessed because there is no proper platform to identify and develop them. I am glad because this is where NIDETH comes in\u201d.",

Buildings have sprung up, filling stations and so on and so forth. So, which of course cause is at several point to redesign the project. Now, we are poised to complete it. And one of the key issues is that the project is based on pumping.\n\n\u201cAt the time it was awarded, diesel was very cheap. But now diesel is so expensive. So, we provided a solar component to provide energy for the pumps, to irrigate the land and this is one of the reasons in addition to variation of prices, foreign exchange fluctuation that calls for a review of this project, seeking for augmentation of about N6 billion and an extension of time to complete the project. At the same time, we felt the need for strengthening the technical, financial, managerial capacity of the company, which has dwindled over time.\n\n\u201cContractors of the company have been there on the site for like 24 years and they\u2019ve lost quite a lot of experts along the way. And therefore, we have now been able to reinforce the original contractor. Rather than terminate the contract, we feel it\u2019s better to just continue by reinforcing the efforts of the contractor through a joint venture with another company which is a Nigerian company, Messers Hydro Source and Resources Limited.\n\n\u201cSo is a joint venture between Messers Impressive Bakolori and Messers Hydro Source and Resources Limited and augmentation it for N6 billion to take the project to N11.026 billion with additional extension period of 24 months, plus 12 months effect liability period, making a total of 36 months.\u201d",

          "text": "By Naomi Douglas\n\n\u2026Call for solution to JetA1, forex scarcity to avoid shutdown\n\nAirline Operators of Nigeria AON, has lamented the closure of Runway by Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria FAAN, for 90 days.\n\nIn a statement signed on Wednesday by AON spokesperson, Professor Obiora Okonkwo said the action will further worsen the crisis facing Nigeria\u2019s aviation industry.\n\nOkonkwo urged federal government to quickly provide solutions to aviation fuel, foreign exchange scarcity to avoid total shutdown, collapse of the sector.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe reality of the situation in the industry is exacerbated by the action of the Federal Airports\n\nAuthority of Nigeria FAAN, which in a NOTAM of July 5, 2022 announced the closure of the\n\ndomestic runway 18L of Murtala Muhammed Airport MMA, Ikeja, beginning July 8, 2022.\n\nThe closure is for a period of 90 days.\n\n48, Awolowo Road, S.W. lkoyi, L.\n\n\u201cJetAl crisis which began in late February and deteriorated further through the months of March to May, has further worsened and is threatening the ability of airlines to continue operations.\n\n\u201cPrice had skyrocketed to over N800 per litre, adding that on top of the continuous rise in the price of Aviation fuel, supply was at best epileptic and unpredictable at several airports across the country, thereby causing flight delays, and even cancellations, as airlines queued for fuel at airports across the country\u201d.\n\nProfessor Okonkwo further noted that airlines carried out most of their activities in US dollars \u201cwhich today sells for N630 to $1; and is sadly also, in short supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a major influence on how quickly a grounded aircraft can be fixed and restored for flight operations, which impacts greatly on the reliability of schedules, growth of the industry and economic growth and sustainability.\n\n\u201cIn the face of the heavy burden already inflicted on airlines by the worsening Jet Al crisis, it is most unfortunate that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria FAAN chose this period to close the runway.\n\n\u201cThe ill-timed and unfortunate decision taken at very short notice to airlines has further crippled air transport operations by causing unsustainable additional operating costs and severely inconveniencing the airlines and passengers.\n\n\u201cThe closure of the main domestic runway of MMA automatically adds an additional 10-15% more fuel costs per sector into and out of the domestic airport in Lagos, based on the\n\nadditional flight and taxi time incurred as a result. The airlines have already felt these additional costs within the first week of the closure of the runway.\n\nThis unnecessary burden is\n\nunsustainable for a 3-month period on the airlines; especially for the fact that the Jet Al crisis has worsened significantly and the situation remains unpredictable.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the additional 30 minutes taxi time to the apron forced on the airlines by the closure of runway 18L impacts negatively on schedule reliability to sunset airports around the country leading to delays and cancellation of late flights to such airports.\n\n\u201cWhile we welcome the effort by FAAN to install runway lighting on Runway 18L after being delayed for so long, it is pertinent to state that international best practice for such critical\n\nairfield infrastructure projects is for the airport operator to enter into discussions with all affected parties, to arrive at an optimal arrangement that allows the work to be done, while limiting the inconvenience, economic impact and safety implications on all concerned.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, the Airline Operators of Nigeria AON wish to use the medium to graciously show appreciation to the Federal Government of Nigeria for its concern, and previous actions, which led to a mutually beneficial and cost-effective three-month aviation fuel supply window through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC. That intervention\n\ngreatly impacted on the aviation sector and solved what would have been a major national embarrassment.\n\n\u201cHowever, the issue is yet to be fully and generously resolved. We, therefore, call on the Federal Government to, once again, look critically at the issues raised in the statement as they affect scarcity and cost of aviation fuel and foreign exchange so as to find ways of ameliorating the problems that are likely to cause a shutdown of this very nationally essential service sector, which had contributed, and continues to contribute, to national economic development through jobs creation, taxes and increased commercial activities.\n\n\u201cAON also thanks the traveling public for empathizing with us in this critical time. Ours is an essential service that is patriotically, and selflessly, driven to serve Nigerians with our best and ensure that they continually, and safely, engage in business and leisure travels that help them achieve their objectives and also contribute positively to national economic development\u201d the statement reads.",

In its wake, a train of events ensued \u2013 culminating in the collapse of the national grid.\n\nShe further noted that \u201cas obtainable in all systems, when a component of the electric power system is defective, the entire configuration is vitiated. However, inspite of setbacks encountered at the initial stage, grid restoration had almost been completed as at 11:00pm when this report was filed.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the kind understanding of Government and consumers of electricity within and outside the country, the GM said the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry is committed to leveraging the concerted interventions instituted thus far to enhance power supply reliability so that the issue of system collapse will soon become a thing of the past.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Mbah asserted that a full-scale investigation is being conducted to establish the cause of this failure.",

          "title": "Nigeria: New Senate Bill Allows States to Generate, Distribute Electricity",
          "text": "The Nigeria Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow states to generate and distribute electricity.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage was sequel to the consideration of a report by the Committee on Power.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Senator Gabriel Suswam (PDP, Benue North East), in his presentation, said the bill seeks to, amongst others, provide an Ideal legal and institutional framework to leverage on the modest gains of the privatisation phase of the electricity power sector in Nigeria.\n\nHe also said anyone or firm generating electricity below one megawatts do not need licence to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bill, when signed into law, will open up the space in the power industry and allows states or individuals with capacities to generate their own power and distribute.\n\n\u201cSince electricity is on the Concurrent List in the constitution, the bill has allowed state governments to license people who intend to operate mini grid within the state.\n\n\u201cThe bill also gives legal backing to renewable energy. If you decide to generate one megawatt of power using solar as energy source, that is also provided for.\n\n\u201cThat is the only way the power problem would be solved. The space is now opened. There is little restriction as to who will generate power and distribute.\n\n\u201cWhat is obtainable now is that any power generated must be put on the national grid for transmission and distribution.\n\n\u201cThe bill also provides that any power generated below one megawatt does not require license to distribute.\u201d\n\nHe added that when signed into law, the bill would improve utilisation of generated power through increased investments in new technologies to enhance transmission and distribution of generated power to minimise aggregate value chain loses.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the piece of legislation would, \u201creinvigorate the Institutional framework for the reform of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) initiated and implemented by the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the provisions of the bill seek to promote policies and regulatory measures that would ensure the expansion of power transmission networks in Nigeria in order to address any imbalance in the existing transmission infrastructure.\n\nSuswam noted that the bill would stimulate policy and regulatory measures to scale up efficient power generation, transmission and distribution capabilities of the sector; as well as address technological limitations and outdated infrastructure that are responsible for value chain loses.\n\nThe Senate President midway through consideration of the bill sought to know the role and operational capacity of banks that had taken over distribution companies (discos) indebted to them.\n\nResponding, Suswam explained that the take-over of entities (Discos) by banks was duly carried out in collaboration with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE).\n\nAccording to him, there was a transitional process put in place during the take-over of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) by the United Bank for Africa (UBA) to ensure efficiency in service delivery.\n\nHe noted that such transitional process usually involves the invitation of new investors to scale up generation and distribution capacities.\n\nHe further disclosed that the federal government had disbursed $100 million to Siemens to kick-start transmission in the distribution end of the power sector.\n\nOn his part, Senator Ahmad Babba-Kaita (PDP \u2013 Katsina North), said the faulty way in which Discos were created was largely responsible for their inability to live up to expectations.\n\nHe, therefore advised the federal government to ensure a transparent process in the selection of companies to take-over power generation and distribution across the country.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks after the passage of the bill, said, \u201cbecause of its importance and sensitivity, we would like to see a quick concurrence by the House of Representatives, because time is of essence as far as Nigeria is concerned when you talk about electricity and energy supplies in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, we would like to see that this bill is fully processed in the National Assembly and sent to the Executive side of government for the consideration for assent by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this piece of legislation can change the fortunes of the electricity industry in Nigeria for the better.\u201d\n\nSenate passes Nigeria Start-up Bill\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has passed the Nigerian Start-up Bill, 2022. The passage of the bill followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on ICT and Cyber Security.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Senator Oseni Yakubu (APC \u2013 Kogi Central), in his presentation, said the bill seeks to provide for the establishment of the National Council for Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship.\n\nAccording to him, the council, upon its establishment, would create and develop an enabling environment for technology-enabled start-ups in Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, a bill for an Act to provide for the ease of doing business to ensure transparency, efficiency and productivity in Nigeria and for other related matters, on Wednesday, scaled second reading.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by the Deputy Senate Leader, Ajayi Boroffice (APC \u2013 Ondo North).\n\nThe bill after consideration, was referred by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, to the Committee on Trade and Investment for further legislative inputs.\n\nThe Committee was given two weeks to report back to the chamber in plenary.\n\nIn a related development, another bill to establish the Federal Nephrology and Kidney Research and Treatment Centre Hadejia, also scaled second reading on the floor.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Senator Hassan Ibrahim Hadejia (APC \u2013 Jigawa North-East), was referred by Lawan to the Committee on Health (Secondary and Tertiary).\n\nThe Senator Yahaya Oloriegbe-led Committee was given four weeks to turn in its report.\n\nSunday Aborisade in Abuja",

We will keep you updated on the situation.\u201d\n\nThe development threw many parts of the country , including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT,) into total darkness and had yet to be resolved as of yesterday evening.\n\nAlso, the Head, Corporate Communications, Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company (KAEDC), Abdulazeez Abdullahi, announced the incident on behalf of the company in a statement published on its Facebook page.\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform our customers that the power failure currently being experienced is as of the collapse of the national grid which occurred by 11:28 this morning.\n\n\u201cWe hereby assure our esteemed customers of restoration of normal power supply as soon as TCN restores supply to us.

          "text": "The Group Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari on Wednesday disclosed that \u2013 working with the Board, management and staff of the company \u2013 his target is to make the entity be among the top 50 among the Fortune 500 Companies in three years.\n\nThe NNPC Limited on Tuesday officially transitioned into a private entity that is now regulated in line with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the GCEO explained that with the huge assets available to the company and the new corporate culture of profit orientation, NNPCL would soon become the toast of the entire continent.\n\nFortune 500 refers to a list of 500 of the largest companies compiled by Fortune magazine, United States, every year wherein companies are ranked by their annual revenues for their respective fiscal years.\n\nThe list includes both public and private companies using publicly available revenue data. According to him, the target would be achievable in the near term.\n\nWhile admitting that because of the mode of operation of the company in the past, Nigerians had lost faith in it, Kyari stated that henceforth the company has no room for excuses not to deliver on its mandate as a commercial venture.\n\n\u201cWe have to deliver together and we are ready to deliver. We know our shareholders, the 200 million Nigerians are doubtful, but we need to surprise them because we know that there is a new expectation and this expectation can be met and this will be led by culture change.\n\n\u201cBefore, you could lose money and nothing will happen, government could always pay, but the law now says we have no recourse to public funds, it will be a commercial relationship\u2026and we have no room for excuses,\u201d he assured.\n\nKyari pointed out that the net assets of the new company remain a major factor working in its favour, stressing that its upstream assets alone could be worth between $80-$90 billion.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this is that the NNPC will clearly not be below 150 (currently) in the Fortune 500 companies and I can tell you this upfront: Our target is that by sheer act of doing things right, we are getting into a business, delivering value and investing appropriately and within three to four years\u2019 time, we should be counting ourselves among the first 50 in the Fortune 500 companies,\u201d he boasted.\n\nHe disputed insinuations that the NNPC was presently in a, \u2018deep financial hole,\u2019 insisting that no company declares profit when its finances are in trouble like the NNPC did last year.\n\nHe added that although Nigerians were losing faith in the NNPC as a corporation, the company would shock doubters by its new mode of adopting global best practices in its operation.\n\n\u201cThings have changed and that change is now being amplified because we have an enabling legislation and we are bound by a new set of rules under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA),\u201d he noted.\n\nStating that the oil and gas industry remains a very profitable one and that the company was willing to scale up its value, he lamented that oil firms less than half of NNPCL\u2019s assets were making more profit.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be IPO ready by the middle of next year,\u201d he reiterated, insisting that the company\u2019s processes will henceforth be world class, reducing wastes as well as paying more taxes to the government.\n\nAlready the largest company in Africa, Kyari noted that Nigerians will be proud of the new NNPC in years to come, with a clear deviation from the way it operated in the past.\n\nIn the coming years, he stated that the company would have private equity, explaining that this would mature in the next 11 months, culminating in a mixed ownership of its shares.\n\n\u201cWe are not in the rank of companies which will be talking about N287 billion (its profit in 2020). We felt very little doing that last year, but we also know we are coming from a past. It\u2019s a process and it will be scaled up,\u201d he added.\n\nOn subsidy, he reiterated that it would no longer be a burden to the NNPC like it was in the last, explaining that it would not affect the company\u2019s bottom line as the oil firm would henceforth charge a fee for providing such service to the government.\n\nHe noted that the ministry of petroleum incorporated and the ministry of finance incorporated currently hold the shares of the company on behalf of over 200 million Nigerians.\n\nOn the contention that the states and local governments are not currently represented on the board of the NNPCL since it\u2019s a federation asset, Kyari stated that the National Assembly which made the law clearly represents every Nigerian.\n\nNNPC: Why Refineries May Not Operate at 100% Capacity After Rehabilitation\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC has said it may not be possible for the Port Harcourt, Warrri and Kaduna oil refineries to function at their full capacities when they come back on stream after rehabilitation.\n\nThe Group Chief Financial Officer (Group CFO) of NNPC, Umar Ajiya, who also spoke on Arise News Channel, noted however, that they would operate at about 80 to 85 per cent nameplate capacity because they constructed roughly 30 years ago.\n\nAjiya disclosed that work on the Warri refinery would likely start next week, noting that the newly adopted model would ensure that the right thing was done so that lenders on the project can be paid back as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to Ajiya, the NNPC decided to repair the assets because it would endanger its objective of ensuring energy security for the nation without some level of operation in the downstream.\n\n\u201cAs envisaged in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), we have to ensure energy security for the country. To that extent, we cannot run away from the refineries. We have to rehabilitate them.\n\n\u201cBut what is changing is that the refineries are going to be rehabilitated with a combination of our own equity and lenders\u2019 money and no lender will lend you money unless they know the money will come out after the rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cBut on top of that, the lenders have also insisted that there has to be O&M contractors supervising the operation of the refineries day in day out. So, rehabilitation is ongoing. Port Harcourt is ongoing, Warri is about to commence any moment, probably next week,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nThe CFO argued that if the nation were to build new refineries, they would cost too much, maintaining that the rehabilitation undertaken by the NNPC remains the best in the circumstance.\n\n\u201cSo, we have that intention to make sure these refineries come back. New refineries are very expensive. You are talking about $3 billion to $5 billion, but the rehabilitation is costing $1 billion and Warri is less than $500 million.\n\n\u201cThese refineries will be rehabilitated but they cannot operate at 100 per cent nameplate capacity. They were constructed almost 30 years ago, so you will expect that when they are fully rehabilitated, they will deliver between 80 per cent to 85 per cent capacity.\n\n\u201cHowever, these same refineries that are being rehabilitated are going to deliver value to not only the shareholders but to lenders who have put money on the table. So, we don\u2019t see any issue because irrespective of whether you rehabilitate or not, you have to do the regular maintenance needed for any plant, whether annual or biannual,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said some other commercialised government businesses failed in the last because in those circumstances, the code of corporate governance was not institutionalised, adding that even after privatisation, government still controlled majority holding.\n\nFor him, in the short to mid-term, the NNPCL will require private funding so that all control mechanisms will be fully activated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why in the PIA, the law envisages that we should go public. When you bring private equity participants, they will ensure that the code of conduct works and that if the board is not performing, its easy to fire them and if management is not doing its work, it will be fired by the board,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has welcomed with high expectation the transition of the NNPC to an independent limited liability company.\n\nNEITI, in a statement released in Abuja, said that the transition was in line with the recommendations of NEITI industry reports for the oil and gas sector covering 1999 to 2019 which equally led to the emergence of the PIA 2021.\n\n\u201cIn the NEITI oil and gas reports that covered 1999 \u2013 2019, NEITI has consistently recommended that Nigeria\u2019s national oil company should be privatised to make it competitive like other national oil companies across the globe,\u201d it stated.\n\nNEITI\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji expressed hope that with the transition to a commercial entity, the NNPC is now in a better position to compete favourably with leading international oil companies around the world.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a business oriented NNPC to deliver the country\u2019s energy needs, energy transition, energy security, diversification of its economy and the building of a sustainable energy future for the country\u201d, Orji noted.\n\nHe further explained that the immediate challenges that the new NNPC needs to tackle is to free Nigeria from fuel importation.\n\n\u201cThe immediate questions that an average Nigerian is asking are: What is likely to change from the NNPC we know and the new NNPC Limited? What will happen to jobs, institutions, profit making, transparency and accountability?\u201d Orji stressed.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Buhari to Shettima: I\u2019ll Hand Over to You and Your Boss in 2023, God Willing",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, at the State House, Abuja, told the Vice-Presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Kashim Shettima, that he was confident he would hand over the leadership of the country to him and his principal, Bola Tinubu, in 2023, God-willing.\n\nBuhari, however, in spite of the growing concern over APC\u2019s preference for a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, expressed optimism that the party would win the February 2023 presidential election regardless.\n\nThe president, who spoke while playing host to Shettima, after he was formally unveiled at the Yar\u2019Adua Centre as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, boasted that the APC would return to power next year.\n\nIn the same breath, Tinubu, at Shettima\u2019s unveiling reiterated that he was committed to his choice of a Muslim-Muslim preference, even as the former Borno State governor explained that his pick was in no way an imposition.\n\nAt the same time, the Director, Media and Communication, Tinubu Campaign Organisation (TCO), Mr. Bayo Onanuga, for the umpteenth time, has reacted to the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the APC, saying it was far from religion and ethnicity considerations, but performance-enhancement based.\n\nHowever, responding to Shettima\u2019s speech, Buhari, who was absent at Shetiima\u2019s official unveiling as the APC leader, said, \u201cI will respond to your speech, when I am handing over to you and your boss. God willing, you are going to win,\u201d adding that, he is very happy with the choice of the former governor of Borno State as Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\n\n\u201cI wish you the best. Your consistency in the party is very respectful. You served your two terms as governor and finished well. You have kept touch with your base. At every important occasion or event, you are maintaining support for the one who succeeded you. This is commendable,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Shettima thanked the president for his empathy, support and positive role, leading to his emergence as running mate to the APC presidential candidate.\n\nWhile praising him for having a special place in his heart for Borno and Northeast, he added: \u201cI can cite 20-30 instances of support you have rendered, for which you will be remembered.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned the establishment of the North East Development Commission (NEDC) and the Independent Power Plant for Maiduguri by the NNPC, \u201cafter many years of darkness,\u201d noting that, \u201cwords cannot describe our appreciation of your support. We will remain eternally grateful.\u201d\n\nHe requested of the President to appreciate his successor, Babagana Zulum, who was in his company, along with the Minister of State, Agriculture, Mustapha Baba Shehuri, for spurning \u201crecurring mention\u201d of him and pressure from his governor colleagues to bid for the vice-presidential ticket.\n\nShettima, however, pledged to remain \u201cloyal and devoted\u201d to the President, promising that his vice-presidency would not be for the \u201ctroika of Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri,\u201d but for all Nigerians, irrespective of ethnicity, religion or geographical place of origin.\n\nSpeaking at the unveiling ceremony, Tinubu said, every election brings with it, the promise of renewed hope, and that, the 2023 elections would be no different. He, however, insisted that, the APC must win the 2023 elections in order to bring a better life to the people of this country.\n\nTinubu said: \u201cEvery election brings with it the promise of renewed hope. This one shall be no different. For our party and for our nation, we hold the chance to move the nation and our collective cause forward as never before.\n\n\u201cTo do this, we must be wise of thought and courageous of action. We must win this election so that we can bring jobs, education, food, medicine, hope and belief in a better life to the people of this country.\n\n\u201cI stand ready to make this journey and, today, I am delighted to stand shoulder to shoulder with my good friend, brother and running mate, His Excellency, Senator Kashim Shettima.\u201d\n\nTinubu who noted that much has been said and written about his decision to pick Shettima as partner, insisted that he remained committed in the choice of Shettima.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs a committed democrat and progressive, I have read and listened to all that has been written and said. It has been an emotional and moving period. I understand the strength of feeling that has been displayed by some within our party and I cherish and respect the views of all.\n\n\u201cYet, I remain steadfast in my belief in the selection of Senator Shettima. I am unwavering in my belief that, he is the very best person to run for office and to, hopefully, govern by my side.\n\n\u201cI believe in the project this party embarked on at the moment of its foundation. I believe our diversity is our strength and I believe that we must be victorious in order to achieve the greatness of which this country is capable.\u201d\n\nShettima, at his unveiling, said his emergence as the running mate to Tinubu was based on the party\u2019s forthright assessment of the threats ahead, adding that he was honoured by the consensus of the party\u2019s stakeholders to trust him and represent the nation\u2019s interests.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere\u2019s no weight I carry very carefully, as much as the burden of trust, and learning from public servants, who never take the expectations of the public, for granted. I\u2019m standing here today, because of the benign testaments of those, who believe in me \u2013 those who crawled so that some of us could walk, and those who walked, for others to run.\u201d\n\nShettima noted that he was not unaware of the difficult political arithmetic that produced this moment, especially, the understanding of the party\u2019s stakeholders and supporters, across religions, regions, and ethnicities, adding that, their resolve to settle for this ticket, was a testament to the faith they have in them.\n\n\u201cThis ticket isn\u2019t an imposition; it\u2019s an outcome of democracy at its practical best, and based on the aggregation of the ideas and insights, of our great party\u2019s stakeholders. If this were an unpopular option, as the cast of partisan provocateurs has attempted to paint, there wouldn\u2019t have been the tonnes of goodwill messages, especially, from distinguished Christians, from all over the country. This ticket is a Nigerian project, not a sectional agenda, that the frightened camps have been struggling to sensationalise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sincerely proud of the rational citizens, who view this, as nothing but a pragmatic permutation, to\n\ndefeat our opponents at the polls, and based on acknowledgment and implementation of the candid perspectives of our Christian brothers and sisters in the APC, who, like us, are bound by the passion for us to retain power, in order to deepen the delivery of unifying and transformative governance, to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShettima recalled that about 30 years ago, Nigerians came together to market the Muslim-Muslim ticket of MKO Abiola and Babagana Kingibe, adding that, the Abiola and Kingibe ticket defied the stereotype of Nigerians, as hopelessly sectional, and incapable of prioritising reason over sentiments.\n\nHe said; \u201cThis reincarnation of the 30-year-old hope that produced the late MKO Abiola and Babagana Kingibe, came at a time the country is being pushed to the edge of anarchy, by conflict entrepreneurs, in gaudy suits and babanriga.\n\n\u201cBut the overwhelming endorsement of Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, at the APC presidential primaries, by aspirants from the very groups predicted to reject him; and his subsequent election by delegates from the same groups, is a clear message, that Nigerians are beyond the stereotypes of those desperate to tear the people apart.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, said Tinubu chose to work along the path of Abiola by choosing a Muslim to be his running mate.\n\nHe stated categorically that Tinubu as a person, has also thrown his arms around every tribe in the country and has offered his shoulders for those in pain to lean on, stressing that he could be trusted to run an inclusive government.\n\n\u201cThose of you who are students of our recent political history will note that in choosing Shettima as his running mate, Jagaban chose also to walk along the path that other great son of this country, Aare Onakakanfo, the late Chief M.K.O. Abiola, did. He chose a Kanuri, Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe from the North-East geo-political zone, as his running mate in the 1993 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to suspect there must be some synergy between the Yoruba and the Kanuri. Maybe there is a mutual attraction between them that the rest of us do not know. Never mind, we will put the searchlight on them.\n\n\u201cThe 1993 presidential ticket and the current one bridged one of our fault lines in the management of our diversities. Nigerians overwhelmingly voted for that ticket, because they trusted Abiola, a man, who opened his arms to every tribe and religion in the country, to run an inclusive government in which no man or woman would be denied his or rights as a Nigerian citizen by the profession of his faith\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a man, who has also thrown his arms around every tribe in the country. He has offered his shoulders for those in pain to lean on; he has used his wealth to bring succour to the needy. He can be trusted to run an inclusive government in which character, competence and vision matter to his administration.\u201d\n\nIn his submission, Fayemi said no doubt, APC governors would have preferred one of them to be the running mate to Tinubu, but added that Tinubu couldn\u2019t have made a better choice.\n\nFayemi expressed optimism that Shettima being a former governor would protect the interest of APC governors.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju can\u2019t find no better assistant, no better partner, no better companion than Shettima. Even in the toughest of time, he led with courage, he led from the front, he challenged us to do more\u2026,\u201d he said, stressing that Tinubu has found himself not just a governing partner, a bridge builder, a consensus builder, but a talent sporter in Shettima.\n\nAccording to him, Shettima would not be a \u201cYes Man\u201d to Tinubu, adding: \u201cAsiwaju is someone that I know very well, and he does not like \u2018yes people\u2019 around him. Kashim Shettima is not going to be a \u2018yes man\u2019. Kashim Shettima is going to offer honest, sincere, independent, verified advice that will be to the betterment of our country.\u201d\n\nThe APC governors that graced the occasion were, Chairman of APC Governors\u2019 Forum and the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu; Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje; Nasarawa State Governor, Abdulahi Sule; Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; outgoing Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola; Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zullum; Deputy Governor of Kogi, Edward Onoja; Kastina State Governor, Bello Masari; Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun; and former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio.\n\nGroup Protests Muslim-Muslim Ticket in Abuja\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Muslim-Muslim protesters, on Thursday, stormed the national secretariat of the APC to register their grievances. The protest took place almost at the same time the leadership of the APC was unveiling Shettima.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, Convener of Forum, Abdullahi Mohammadu, said they would not stop protesting until the party does the right this.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Adamu, Mohammadu stated that they saw the selection of Shettima as an aberration that should be corrected immediately by the leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cWe write to your good office in light of the prevailing circumstances arising from the decision of our presidential candidate to select a Northern Muslim as his vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile it must be stated that there is a right to make decisions, however, such decisions must not be made to the collective detriment of the sensibilities of the people that make up the country of Nigeria especially, at a time of mutual suspicion amongst the Christians and Muslims in the northern part of the country,\u201d the letter read.\n\nDirector, Media and Communication, Tinubu Campaign Organisation (TCO), Bayo Onanuga, has said if Tinubu intended to cash in on ethnicity, he would have picked a running mate from the North Western part of Nigeria, which has the highest number of registered voters.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf he wanted to appeal to the base instincts of religion, he would have also gone for a candidate in the Christian dominated parts of Nigeria. But there was no such consideration. Instead, he picked a tested politician and technocrat from the minority Kanuri ethnic group from the North East,\u201d\n\nHe added that the factors at play were issues germane to confronting the multi-dimensional crises the nation faces today, which included insecurity, economic problems, such as the unemployment crisis facing our youths.\n\n\u201cOur candidate canvassed on his track record in Lagos to win the APC primary last June. As governor between 1999 and 2007, he was able to transform a decadent state into the fourth biggest economy in Africa. He believes that his feat in Lagos can be replicated all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo assist him in realising this vision, he picked Kashim Shettima, who also established a track record of development in Borno State ,while he was governor for eight years, despite the Boko Haram crisis. Surely, only the deep knows how to call onto the deep. Nigerians have a lot to gain in having the two tested leaders at the helm of affairs.\n\n\u201cNaturally, some Nigerians with closet motives have failed to see the opportunities and possibilities the twin candidates present to our country at this time of difficult security, economic and political developments, preferring to fan the embers of religion and ethnic divisions among their unsuspecting and vulnerable compatriots,\u201d he explained.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
