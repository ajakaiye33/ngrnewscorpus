We, therefore, call on the state government to effectively monitor the same.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Child Protection Network says all schools have full responsibility in respect of their \u2018duty of care to protect children and to support pupils/students in the school. These givers/teachers have day-to-day contact with individual children during school terms, they are therefore particularly well placed to observe outward signs of abuse, changes in behaviour, or failure to develop.\n\n\u201c(Working Together \u2013 Under the Children Act, 1989). Teachers, teaching assistants and other school supervisors should note that reporting the suspicion of child abuse, \u201cin good faith\u201d exempts them from sanction by the law.\n\n\u201cWe demand an abuse free environment for children in Lagos State irrespective of the kind of school they attend, private or government.\n\n\u201cWe demand that child protection policy should be mandatory for every school or places where children are and must be pasted in a conspicuous area within the premises. In case of any mishap or abuse while in the school\u2019s custody, the caregivers/teachers & support staff must be responsible and accountable for their safety.\n\n\u201cA few weeks back, a girl in America took her own life because she was being bullied. We thought that was the worst-case scenario until a few days ago when we heard that this boy was allegedly beaten to death by his schoolmates. This is so worrisome\u201d, Oyelakin lamented.\n\nSpeaking on parents\u2019 roles in child upbringing, Aderonke called on the parents and guardians to up their games on raising children properly. \u201cThe question is, who is raising these children that committed these acts? Parents need to do more and know who their children are. You need to know if your child is a bully or an accomplice to a bully or even a bystander when another child is being bullied. Parents also need to ask themselves a question whether he or she is contributing to making his/her child a victim of bullying\u201d.\n\nAderonke added that many parents outsourced the grooming responsibilities to the schools who are mostly interested in the school fees. She advised parents to become conscious and deliberate about raising kind and confident children who know how to stand up, speak up and defend themselves against bullies.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026.Says hapless natives dying in droves due to artificial gridlock by security agents\n\nSoni Daniel, Abuja\n\nAlarmed by the organized extortion of ordinary road users in the Southeast, a member of the National Human Rights Commission, Ozo Joe Mmamel, has petitioned the Enugu State Police Commissioner, and the General Officer Commanding the 82nd Division of the Nigerian Army to call their fraudulent officers and men to order in order to save the lives of the people of the area.\n\nOzo Mmamel, who is a special rapporteur on corruption, election and good governance, said he was forced to petition the two top security agencies because of increasing extortion of poor natives of the state by soldiers and policemen, who are statutorily meant to protect and defend the hapless natives.\n\nIn the two separate letters addressed to the GOC 82 Division and the CP Enugu State, Mmamel drew the attention of the GOC and the CP to illicit activities of soldiers and policemen, who have turned the highways into a mining field by placing heavy fees on all motorists passing through the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway via Independence Layout, Enugu-9th Mile Express by Uguwu Onyeama and 9th Mile-Udi Old Road.\n\nIn the letter to the Enugu CP dated November 9, 2021, the Human Rights Commissioner wrote: \u201cI have received several complaints from well-meaning citizens on the degrading and inhuman treatment being meted on travelers by the military and the police force, especially on these roads mentioned above.\n\n\u201cThese roads blocks manned by personnel of the Nigerian army and the Nigerian police, have caused untold hardships to the road users, who most of the times stay in artificially-created traffic gridlock by soldiers and policemen who openly collect money from transporters who ply the roads without caring about how long they stay on the hot sun.\n\n\u201cAs it has emerged, it does not seem to bother these soldiers and policemen that they are subjecting innocent citizens of Nigeria they are expected to protect and defend, to undue and avoidable hardship as long as they collect bribes openly from the poor transporters without any form of shame and empathy on the poor souls they are exploiting.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these mindless exploitations by soldiers and policemen, travelling in and out of Enugu metropolis is now a nightmare because of the traffic gridlock mostly occasioned by these roadblocks and checkpoints. There are at least four roadblocks/checkpoints by both military and police force from Naira Triangle/NNPC Mega Station to Four Corner Ozalla Junction Enugu-Port Harcourt Express Road, a distance of about ten kilometers.\n\n\u201cSir, imagine the mental and physical torture a traveler on that road goes through daily in these hard times. Sir, it is pertinent to inform you that the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Ituku, Ozalla, a major health service provider, is situate along the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway. Many patients have lost their lives because they cannot not quick access /emergency service to the referral hospital. Medical personnel and other employees have the same sad tales to tell arising from the desire by soldiers and policemen to make quick money at the expense of human lives.\n\n\u201cAs you may be aware, this is a violation of the right to dignity of human person as enshrined under Chapter Four of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and does not conform to the international best practices expected of a modern society like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe humbly request you to use your good offices to abate these infringements of rights to dignity of our people plying these roads in order to ameliorate their plights on a daily basis. Please, accept the assurance of our highest regards,\u201d Joe Mmamel, wrote and copies the GOC 82 Division of the Nigerian Army Enugu.",

          "text": "Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, has said the zoning of the 2023 presidency to the southeast would end the secession agitation in the region.\n\nNgige said all the agitations for Biafra and the wounds of the civil war would be permanently healed if an Igbo person emerges as President in the 2023 general election.\n\nSpeaking with Channels Television, the minister said the Southeast would forgive the entire Nigeria for the \u201csins\u201d of the civil war.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians of all shades of opinion in all the political parties agree to send down the presidency in both parties to the South-East, you would have buried the ghosts of the civil war permanently.\n\n\u201cYou would have buried all the separatist agitations permanently; you would have buried all the sins of \u2018oh no appointments, these and that\u2019 permanently. Everything will begin to rest,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that the zoning of the presidency to the Southeast was a sensitive one considering the issues surrounding it.\n\n\u201cWhy do I say so? I say so because we have a constitution of Nigeria which does not have the issue of zoning and rotation entrenched in it.\n\n\u201cBut that same constitution, in section 14 talks about federal character and that in any establishment of government, there must be semblance of everybody participating so that there would not be any perception of monopoly of functions of the office there or the powers there by any section of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, that area of the constitution, if you extrapolate it, it is talking about rotation. If you extrapolate it, it is talking about zoning, states to be represented in government or any government institution.\n\n\u201cThat is why some political parties like the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) now have zoning and rotation. In the APC, we don\u2019t have rotation entrenched there. But by mutual agreement, we\u2019re doing zoning.\n\n\u201cWe zoned the offices in the party. That\u2019s why whenever you have the chairman coming from the North, the secretary will be South and vice versa. These are the two effective offices or power in any political party,\u201d he added.\n\nNnamdi Kanu and his group, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, have been in the forefront agitating for the restoration of Biafra.\n\nTo this end, Kanu was arrested in July in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria, where he is being detained by the Department of State Services, DSS.",

This is another desperate but futile attempt by the Nigerian security agencies to implicate IPOB and ESN operatives. It, however, did not come to us as a surprise because it has been their stock in trade. This is another blatant falsehood.\n\n\u201cFor the records, IPOB and ESN operatives never planted, and have no plans to plant IEDs in any part of Biafra land. ESN since its inauguration by our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU in December last year has never engaged in any terrorist activity. Its mandate has not changed: protection of our ancestral land against Fulani herdsmen and bandits attacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only ridiculous for the security agencies to try to link IPOB or ESN with the planting of IEDs, when in fact Nigerians know who those who plant IEDs are. Planting explosives is the signature tune of the Fulani terrorists and bandits.\n\n\u201cAssuming but not in any way admitting this idiotic trash, if we should resort to the planting of IEDs, who do we want to kill? What do we want to achieve? How can we be stupid to begin to plant bombs that will kill our people whom we are staking our lives daily to protect and defend against Fulani terrorists?\n\n\u201cTo further punctuate their lies, how come these shameless liars claiming to be security agents are only swift in discovering IEDs purportedly planted by IPOB and ESN but fail to detect the same IEDs planted by Fulani bandits and terrorists which have claimed thousands of lives in the North including security operatives themselves although mainly from Southern Nigeria? It is now clear that these terrorists in military and police uniforms are working in cahoot with their rag-tag counterparts in the forests to achieve the same agenda. While they keep betraying Southern troops serving in the North, these jihadists and terrorists in security uniforms deployed to Biafra land are now busy planting IEDs in their desperation to implicate IPOB and ESN.\u201d",

We shall begin to resist any clandestine attempt to silence or ridicule us to oblivion. Nigeria, to the best of my knowledge, is not a lawless society.\n\n\u201cWe should begin to do things that will project us favourably and rightly, too, to the International community.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Fred Itua, Ndubuisi Orji, Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), yesterday, confirmed three additional cases of COVID-19 with the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 lineage, the Omicron variant.\n\nThe three cases were in addition to the three earlier announced on December 1. This brings the tally of confirmed Omicron cases in Nigeria to six.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nNCDC, in a statement by its Director General, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, noted that all the Omicron cases, so far, were detected in persons with recent travel history to South Africa in November.\n\nThis came as the United Kingdom government said seven travelers from Nigeria had returned positive for Omicron.\n\nNCDC boss confirmed that the UK has formally written to Nigeria on the matter in line with the global health practice.\n\n\u201cIn line with Article 44 of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) reporting framework, the Federal Government of Nigeria through the NCDC has been notified by the UK Government of seven cases of travellers from Nigeria with the Omicron variant.\u201d\n\nDr. Adetifa, however, said that given the reports of increasing numbers of Omicron cases in the UK, the NCDC was also prioritising the sequencing of COVID-19 positive samples in travellers with history of travel to the UK.\n\n\u201cAll viruses naturally mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 was first identified, several mutations have occurred with the emergence of new lineages.\n\n\u201cThis will continue to happen as long as the world does not act in concert to significantly reduce transmission through vaccination and adherence to effective public health measures such as face mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, andensuring good ventilation.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that compliance with the travel protocols provided by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC-COVID-19) is mandatory for all international travellers arriving in Nigeria from any country and advised incoming travellers to ensure their day two and day seven tests were done as stipulated in Nigeria\u2019s travel advisory, otherwise, there would be consequences which may include publication of details, suspension of their passports and ban on travel to Nigeria.\n\n\u2022Govs Fumes\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has called on the World Health Organisation (WHO) to intervene by setting uniform standards that are acceptable to all for banning countries across the globe.\n\nThe call followed the travel ban placed on Nigeria by Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe NGF described the inclusion of Nigeria among the Omicron present countries which must stay away from their shores as as precipitate, unfair and discriminatory.\n\nIts chairman and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, in a statement he personally signed, drew the attention of WHO to what the governors called arbitrary stigmatisation that is caused by the recent banning of countries from visitation based on omicron spread.\n\nAccording to the NGF, \u201cOmicron still remains relatively unknown globally as it is not yet clear whether it is more transmissible from person to person compared to other variants including Delta.\n\n\u201cIt is very discouraging to note that there are several countries that have reported cases of Omicron similar to or higher than Nigeria\u2019s, that have not been banned from entry to the UK and/Canada.\n\n\u201cConfirmed Omicron cases as at December 3rd, across some countries are: Nigeria (3 ); Australia (7); Brazil (3); Germany (9) Israel(4); Italy (9) and Netherlands(16). There is also no evidence that harsh, blanket travel bans will protect the countries that impose them.\n\n\u201cIt is ironical that this ban comes at a time when the DG of the WHO, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has advised that \u201crational proportional risk reduction measures\u201d be taken by countries such as screening passengers prior to departure and/or upon arrival in a country, or enforcing a quarantine period.\n\n\u201cThe NGF, therefore, urges the WHO to intervene in this matter by setting uniform standards that are acceptable to all for banning countries across the globe.\n\n\u201cAs we know, vaccine hesitancy is quite high and for many reasons including disruptive announcements like this which could exacerbate distrust of the vaccine and heighten hesitancy.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders and stakeholders in the West need to remember that with the COVID-19 pandemic, until everyone is free, no one is free. Variants will continue to appear and spread across the globe as long as global herd immunity has not been achieved.\n\n\u201cWe call on countries to be guided by science and fairness in setting the criteria for updating their red list. We encourage both public and private stakeholders to continue to support vaccination efforts and address hesitancy. We encourage Nigerians not to be discouraged and to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u2022Senate seeks ban reversal\n\nAlso reacting to the travel ban, the Senate advised the British government to be sensitive to the diplomatic relationship between both countries when taking a decision that affects Nigerians.\n\nIt urged the Federal Government to engage the British authorities to reverse Nigeria\u2019s inclusion on the red list andcharged the administration to remain firm in the enforcement of necessary protocols in the containment of every COVID-19 variant in Nigeria.\n\nIt also called on major vaccines powers, namely, Britain, Canada, America and the European Union, among others, to take urgent and bold steps to ensure vaccine equity in the interest of the entire human race.\n\nThese were parts of resolutions reached by the chamber, following the consideration of a motion on the \u201cNeed for Government of the United Kingdom to remove Nigeria from COVID-19 Red List.\u201d\n\nThe motion was sponsored by Ike Ekweremadu.\n\nComing under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules, he noted with satisfaction the efforts of the Nigerian government in the containment and treatment of COVID-19 cases.\n\n\u201cNigeria is among the countries with the lowest cases of COVID-19. The decision by the British government to include Nigeria in their COVID-19 list, with its concomitant implications, will affect many citizens of Nigeria, who had planned to spend their Christmas and New Year holiday with their families.\n\n\u201cAlso worried that Nigerians with genuine needs to visit the UK within this period will be denied visa and those with visa will not be allowed to enter the UK.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker noted that Nigerians have consistently complied with all the COVID-19 protocols required by the WHO and UK government for travelers prior to the ban.\n\nHe emphasised that \u201ctargeting African countries, especially in the COVID-19 travel ban, amounts to profiling and discrimination as well as an attack on our cordial diplomatic relationship with the UK.\u201d\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the decision to include Nigeria on the UK COVID-19 red list poses a strain on the diplomatic relationship between both countries. He bemoaned the poor treatment of Nigeria by the UK government.\n\nLawan, therefore, called on the British parliament to intervene with a view to having Nigeria removed from the country\u2019s COVID-19 red list.\n\n\u201cLet there be justification for it. We are not saying that they cannot put any country on the red list, including Nigeria, but there must be reasons for doing that.\n\n\u201cNigeria has done so well to the admiration of many countries in the area of containment of COVID-19. Therefore, we don\u2019t see any reason why Nigeria will be on that so called red list.\n\n\u201cI believe that Nigerians deserve better treatment from the British government. I\u2019m using this opportunity to ask the British Parliament to mount pressure on their government to remove Nigeria from the so called red list.\u201d\n\nReps kick over UK travel ban\n\nThe House of Representatives also called on the UK to rescind the ban immediately and urged the Federal Government to interface with the UK authorities, immediately over the issue.\n\nElumelu, in a motion moved under matters of urgent public importance, on the \u201cneed to intervene in the issuance of visitors visa to Nigerians by the United Kingdom Government\u201d explained that the ban affects those going to the UK for tourism, visiting friends and family, business trips, exchange programmes, as well as medical reasons.\n\nElumelu expressed worry that \u201crather than seek to work with its commonwealth ally on ways to combat and curtail the spread of this new variant, the UK government decided to out rightly ban Nigerian travelers from entering their country which is a sharp contrast to that of the United States government whose response is for travelers to produce evidence of negative test result at the point of departure as well as a day two test result after arrival in their country, a response that have received wide commendation across board.\n\n\u201cThe UK government chose to announce the ban without discussing the data in its possession with the Nigerian government but instead gave an hour notice to the Nigeria authorities before its inclusion on the red list, contrary to known international convention. \u2026Omicron variant has now been found in over 40 countries around the world including many from the European Union but only Nigeria and a few African countries have been banned by the UK government.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

He stated that would cost the country serious revenue loss. The House mandated its committees on health and foreign affairs to interface with the ministries of health, foreign affairs and the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on how to resolve the issue.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "A Federal High Court, Abuja, yesterday, declined to vacate its order restraining the Federal Government from deducting monies accruing to the 36 states from the federation account to settle $418 million judgment debt in relation to Paris Club Refund.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo adjourned the matter until December 13. He held that since the order was made based on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion on notice filed before the court, all pending applications would be taken on the next adjourned date.\n\nThe judge had, on November 5 made the order after counsel to the 36 state governments (plaintiffs), Jibrin Okutekpa, SAN, moved an ex-parte motion, seeking an order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from deducting any money accruing or due to all or any of the 36 states of the federation.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe court had also ruled that the restraining order would subsist pending the determination of the substantive suit.\n\nWhile the 36 states Attorneys-General are the plaintiffs, some of the defendants listed in the suit include the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Accountant General of the Federation and Ministry of Finance. Others are Central Bank of Nigeria, Debt Management Office, Federation Account Allocation Committee, Incorporated Trustees of Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), among others.\n\nAccording to the motion dated and filed October 27, 43 defendants are sued in the matter.\n\nAt the resumed hearing, counsel to the plaintiffs, Okutekpa told the court that the matter was slated for hearing. He said he had two motions which he intended to move.\n\nHe told the court that though most of the defendants had responded by serving on them various applications, the ninth defendant (Dr. Chris Asoluka, who does business under the name and style of NIPAL Consulting Network) had refused to receive their court processes.\n\n\u201cWe have a motion ex-parte to serve the nine defendant an originating process. The process dated December 6 was filed on December 6 and it is praying for an order of substituted service on the ninth defendant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge granted prayer one of the motion and ordered that the service be made on the ninth defendant within three days through pasting of the notice on his address.\n\nThe senior lawyer told the court that the second motion was an application praying the court for an extension of time to file and serve their counter affidavit and all other processes in response to the defendants\u2019 applications.\n\nEkwo also granted prayer one of the motion and granted prayer two in part subject to the service of the motion on the two counsel who appeared for 15th, 16th, 10th and 11th defendants.\n\nThe two counsel had opposed the motion on the ground that they had not been served with the copy.\n\nOkutekpa then asked for a date for hearing.\n\nHowever, Oyin Koleoso who appeared for the first, 2 second, fourth and sixth defendants (president of Nigeria, AGF, Ministry of Finance Incorporated and Debt Management Office), informed the court that a motion asking the court to vacate the earlier order made had been filed.\n\nWole Olanipekun, SAN, who appeared for the 14th defendant (Dr. Ted Iseghohi-Edwards) also urged the court to set aside the order.\n\nHe argued that he made the plea based on the Supreme Court and Appeal Court decisions under which the judge took the application.\n\nChief Olusola Oke, SAN, who is lawyer to 12th and 13th defendants (Riok Nigeria Ltd and Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu) also supported Olanipekun\u2019s submission.\n\nOke, who told the court that his clients were affected by the order, urged the court to take their application seeking for the order to be vacated.\n\nOrji Orizu, who appeared for himself in the suit as 18th defendant, backed Oke\u2019s statement.\n\nHe argued that since an ex-parte motion lasts within 14 days, the lawyer prayed the court to discharge the order.\n\nIdumodin Ogumu, who represented 15th and 16th defendants ( Panic Alert Security Services Systems Ltd and Dr George Uboh), said he aligned himself with submissions of other counsel.\n\nHe argued that based on the rule of the court, the order granted by the court was deemed to have elapsed and no longer had effect.\n\nHowever, counsel to the plaintiffs, Okutekpa, disagreed with the defence submission.\n\nHe referred the court to the order which its made. The senior lawyer argued that it was an order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government, acting through its agencies also joined in the suit, from deducting the plaintiffs\u2019 monies pending the determination of the motion on notice.\n\nHe said the order was also made in compliance with the rule of the court.\n\n\u201cYour Lordship was aware of the rule when you were making the order.

          "text": "\u2022Wants restriction scrapped\n\n\u2022 Travel ban discriminatory, attack on diplomatic relations, Senate tells UK\n\n\u2022NCDC confirms three new cases\n\n\u2022Seven travellers from Nigeria test positive in UK\n\n\u2022NCAA threatens to ban international airlines that flout COVID-19 protocols\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Adedayo Akinwale,\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Chinedu Eze in Lagos\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Rev. Justin Welby yesterday waded into the growing outrage among Nigerians condemning the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) inclusion of Nigeria in its COVID-19 red list without justification, saying it was a \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d and calls for it to be scrapped.\n\nIn series of tweets on his Twitter handle,@JustinWelby, the Archbishop of Canterbury urged the UK government to abolish what he described as the \u201cmorally wrong and self-defeating\u201d red list.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary General had a few days ago described the action of the UK government as travel Apartheid, targeted at poor nations.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Senate yesterday, also insisted that the travel ban was discriminatory and an attack on diplomatic relations between the two nations and called for the UK to remove it.\n\nThe Red chamber at plenary accordingly, called on the British authorities to consider removing Nigeria from the red list.\n\nHowever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) yesterday confirmed three more omicron cases in Nigeria.\n\nThe centre also said that Nigeria has been notified by the UK government of seven cases of travellers from Nigeria with the infection.\n\nThis was just as the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has threatened to ban from Nigeria, any airline operating international services that do not abide by the country\u2019s COVID-19 protocols for passengers as issued by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC).\n\nNigeria became the 11th country to go on the UK\u2019s red list for international travelon Monday. All nations currently on that list are African.\n\nThe only people allowed to enter the UK from these countries are UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents. They would have to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked government-approved hotel for a total of 10 days.\n\nBut in a message to his 165,000 Twitter followers, the Archbishop wrote: \u201cWith #Omicron set to become the dominant variant in the UK, I appeal to the British government to remove Nigeria and South Africa from the red list \u2013 together with all other countries currently on it.\n\n\u201cWe must find fair and effective approaches for those who are vaccinated and tested to enter the UK. I agree with the Nigerian High Commissioner to the UK \u2013 we cannot have \u2018travel apartheid\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is also morally wrong \u2013 and self-defeating \u2013 effectively to punish other nations for being transparent when they discover new Covid variants, as @ArchbishopThabo of Cape Town has said.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had said that blanket travel bans would not stop the spread of the variant, and could potentially discourage countries from reporting and sharing important data on coronavirus.\n\nWelby had previously criticised the addition of Nigeria, Botswana and South Africa to the red list, saying they were \u201ccountries already suffering that will suffer more.\u201d\n\nSenate Wants Nigeria Removed from Red List\n\nFurthermore, the Senate advised the UK government to be sensitive to the diplomatic relationship between both countries when taking decision that affect Nigerian citizens.\n\nIt urged the federal government to engage British authorities to reverse Nigeria\u2019s inclusion on the red list.\n\nThe upper chamber also charged the administration to remain firm in the enforcement of necessary protocols in the containment of every COVID-19 variant in Nigeria.\n\nIt further advised developing countries which it listed to include Britain, Canada, United States of America, the European Union, among others, to take urgent and bold steps to ensure vaccine equity in the interest of the entire human race.\n\nThe resolutions were reached by the Senate sequel to the consideration of a motion on the, \u201cNeed for Government of the United Kingdom to remove Nigeria from COVID-19 Red List,\u201d sponsored by the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu (Enugu West).\n\nComing under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules, Ekweremadu noted with satisfaction the efforts of the Government of Nigeria in the containment and treatment of COVID-19 cases.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cNigeria is among the countries with the lowest cases of COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision by the British Government to include Nigeria in their COVID-19 list, with its concomitant implications, will affect many citizens of Nigeria, who had planned to spend their Christmas and New Year holiday with their families.\n\n\u201cAlso worried that Nigerians with genuine needs to visit the U.K within this period will be denied visa and those with visa will not be allowed to enter the U.K.\u201d\n\nThe ranking Senator noted that Nigerians have consistently complied with all the COVID-19 protocols required by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UK Government for travelers prior to the ban.\n\nHe emphasised that, \u201ctargeting African countries, especially in the COVID-19 travel ban, amounts to profiling and discrimination as well as an attack on our cordial diplomatic relationship with the UK.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu drew the attention of the lawmakers to global concerns over vaccines hoarding and inequity and the resulting consequences on low-income nations in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nIn his contribution, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the decision to include Nigeria on the UK COVID-19 red list posed a strain on the diplomatic relationship between both countries, just as he bemoaned the poor treatment of Nigeria by the UK government.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the British Parliament to intervene with a view to having Nigeria removed from the country\u2019s COVID-19 red list.\n\nLawan added: \u201cLet there be justification for it. We are not saying that they cannot put any country on the red list, including Nigeria, but there must be reasons for doing that.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, Nigeria has done so well to the admiration of many countries in the area of containment of COVID-19. Therefore, we don\u2019t see any reason why Nigeria will be on that so called red list.\n\n\u201cI believe that Nigerians deserve better treatment from the British government. I\u2019m using this opportunity to ask the British Parliament to mount pressure on their government to remove Nigeria from the so called red list.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, members of the House of Representatives were sharply divided yesterday, following a debate on the decision of the UK to place temporary visa ban on Nigerians after the discovery of omicron variant.\n\nWhile some House of Representatives members were of the views that the decision of the UK government against Nigerians was harsh and racist, others believed it was a wake-up call on the government and those in authority to fix the country, especially the health and education sector.\n\nWhile the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase who presided over the plenary allocated more time for the debate on temporary visa ban to run for almost an hour, the debate on the death of a pupil at Dowen College, Lagos didn\u2019t enjoy the same preference.\n\nMoving the motion, the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu said the decision of the UK government came only a few days after Canada extended its travel ban to travelers who recently visited Nigeria.\n\nHe said though the ban was for Nigerians bound for the UK, it does not exempt over 8,000 Nigerian travelers that had bought air tickets to visit Nigeria during the yuletide period, saying the restriction would affect their re-entry into the UK after holidays.\n\nElumelu noted that rather than seek to work with its commonwealth ally on ways to combat and curtail the spread of this new variant, the UK government decided to outright ban Nigerian travelers from entering their country.\n\nAccording to him, this was in sharp contrast to that of the United States government whose response was for travelers to produce evidence of negative test result at the point of departure as well as a day two test result after arrival in their country, a response that have received wide commendation across board,\n\nThe lawmaker further expressed worry that the UK government chose to announce the ban without discussing the data in its possession with the Nigerian government, but instead gave an hour notice to the Nigeria authorities before its inclusion on the red list, contrary to known international convention.\n\nElumelu said the Omicron variant has now been found in over 40 countries around the world including many from the European Union, but only Nigeria and a few African countries were banned by the UK government.\n\nThe minority leader stressed that if the Nigerian government does not urgently engage the authorities of UK, the decision could have a significant impact on businesses and travelers intending to carry out lawful transactions in the UK as opportunities and investments already made would be lost, hence the need for a quick interface.\n\nElumelu noted that children who school abroad and had thought of returning home during this festive period to rejoin with their families and with fears that when they later go back would be subjected to 10 days mandatory isolation centre and be made to pay \u00a32,700 for such hotel bookings may be totally discouraged from coming home and thereby deny such families the opportunity of their children rejoining them for this annual family union.\n\nContributing, Hon. Aminu Suleiman said there was a need for the country to do internal assessment.\n\nHe said Nigeria has already admitted to having an omicron variant, saying there was no need castigating another sovereign country for taking such a decision as it has the right to do so.\n\nOn his part, Hon. Nicholas Ossai said the issue canvassed by the minority leader was germane, adding that there was need to meet with the British government and resolve the issue diplomatically.\n\nIn his submission, Hon. Nnonli Nnaji said inasmuch as he aligned himself to the motion, the message from the action by the UK government was for Nigerians to fix their country.\n\nOn his part, Hon. Onofiok Luke said there was a need for introspection, stressing that there was need to join hands with the leadership to make sure that the right things are done.\n\nHe said rather than blaming other countries, there was a need to fix the country and make things work.\n\nNCDC Confirms Three New Cases of Omicron Variant\n\nHowever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has\n\nconfirmed three more cases of the COVID-19 with the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 lineage, which is the omicron variant, in Nigeria.\n\nA statement signed by the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, noted that given reports of increasing numbers of omicron cases in the UK, the NCDC was prioritising the sequencing of COVID-19 positive samples in travellers with history of travel to the UK.\n\nThe three new cases bring the total number of omicron variant so far detected in Nigeria to six.\n\nNCDC had previously announced the detection of three cases of omicron variant on December 2021.\n\nIn the statement, Adetifa said all omicron cases so far detected in Nigeria were detected in persons with recent travel history to South Africa in November.\n\n\u201cIn line with Article 44 of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) reporting framework, the federal government of Nigeria through the NCDC has also been notified by the UK government of seven cases of travellers from Nigeria with the Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cGiven the reports of increasing numbers of Omicron cases in the UK, the NCDC is also prioritising the sequencing of COVID-19 positive samples in travellers with history of travel to the UK,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe NCDC said it would through the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) continue to coordinate genomic surveillance activities across the country to sequence all positive COVID-19 samples from international travellers arriving in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis includes sequencing of positive samples from international travellers from October 2021 to date,\u201d said NCDC.\n\nThe Centre however maintained that the Delta variant has remained the dominant variant than the new omicron variant.\n\nIt also stated that there was no evidence of generalised or community transmission of this variant in Nigeria.\n\nThe Centre said it would continue implement effective public heath measures such as mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and defaulters which may include publication of their details, suspension of their passports take personal and collective responsibility to ensure the safety of all Nigerians.\n\nFurthermore, it advised that incoming travellers should ensure their day two and day seven tests are done into effect on day five in compliance with the travel protocols provided by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID19.\n\n\u201cThe NCDC and the Federal Ministry of Health urges members of the public to continue to COVID-19 (PSC-COVID-19) is mandatory for all international travellers arriving in Nigeria and ban on travel to Nigeria by the PSC-COVID-19.\n\nNCAA Threatens to Ban International Airlines\n\nThe NCAA has threatened to ban from Nigeria any airline operating international services that does not abide by COVID-19 protocols for its passengers, as issued by the PSC.\n\nIt stressed that non-compliance to the boarding requirements by any airline would attract a penalty of $3, 500 per passenger adding that airlines which consistently fail to comply with these requirements, may be banned from coming to Nigeria.\n\nThe aviation regulatory authority insisted that the airlines must follow revised quarantine protocol for travellers arriving or departing Nigeria. It also said passengers must follow the revised provisional quarantine protocol as updated by the PSC on COVID-19.\n\nNCAA therefore directed all airline operators to convey to travellers the revised provisional quarantine protocol.\n\nIn a statement dated December 3, 2021, and directed to airline accountable managers and country manager, it stated: \u201cAirlines are to however note that protocols for international flight operations issued on 1st July 2021 still subsists.\u201d\n\nOn inbound passengers, the NCAA stated that airlines are to only board passengers travelling to Nigeria who are in possession of a paid permit to travel with QR Code and result of a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours from time of boarding the flight.\n\n\u201cFor any inbound passenger who is unable to either make payment for his /her repeat PCR test(s) or generate a paid permit to travel via the Nigerian international Travel Portal (NIPT), airlines are to send an email to designated email addresses for necessary assistance,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement which was signed by the NCAA Director General, Captain Musa Nuhu also stated that for outbound flights, airlines are to only board passengers travelling out of Nigeria with evidence of either full vaccination for COVID-19 or result of negative COVID-19 PCR test done at NCDC accredited private laboratories not later than 48 hours from time of boarding.\n\nNigeria Can Only Embark on Retaliatory Action as Last Resort, Says NIIA\n\nIn a related development, the Director General of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Prof. Eghosa Osaghae, yesterday argued that unless all other avenue\u2019s had been exhausted, Nigeria may not retaliate.\n\nSpeaking on ARISE Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Osaghae who was reacting to calls by some Nigerians to ban UK citizens from the country in like manner, argued that until all other alternatives to a peaceful resolution were fully deployed, retaliation would not be necessary.\n\n\u201cBy the way, if you have exhausted all possible avenues for addressing disagreements or conflicts of this nature, then of course, you know if all these fail, you can then resort to reciprocity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that you know that this is not something that is beyond resolution and as the chair of our response team, the secretary to the government of the federation said yesterday that there are talks going on behind the scene and we hope that this issue will be resolved,\u201d he stressed.\n\nOsaghae expressed the hope that the issue doesn\u2019t degenerate in the coming days, saying that the British response had been too highhanded and discriminatory.\n\n\u201c At the last count, there were 47 countries that had reported cases of Omicron, the variant, and out of these 47, there are only about six in Africa. And when you introduce travel restrictions, it is not to all of these 47 countries, it\u2019s only to the Southern African countries and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd yet the evidence suggests that this (virus) is not restricted to Africa. It\u2019s not restricted to Nigeria. And Nigeria itself is not a source. It\u2019s not an originator. The fact that it was detected, that doesn\u2019t make South Africa the owner,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emma Okonji\n\nWith the successful acquisition of GPX India and 13 Bell Data Centers in Canada, Equinix, one of the world\u2019s digital infrastructure companies, yesterday announced its expansion into Africa through a deal to acquire MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider.\n\nAccording to a statement, the transaction has an enterprise value of $320 million.\n\nMainOne currently has presence in Nigeria, Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, with establishment of its tier 111 Data Centre in the aforementioned countries and is also building a second data centre in Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nThe acquisition was expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nThe transaction was expected to be Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) accretive upon close, excluding integration costs, marking the first step in Equinix\u2019s long-term strategy to become a leading African carrier neutral digital infrastructure company.\n\nWith more than 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest economy and, along with Ghana, has become an established data center hub.\n\nThis makes the acquisition a pivotal entry point for Equinix into the continent.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, the company has enabled connectivity for the business community of Nigeria and now has digital infrastructure assets including three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022.\n\n\u201cUpon closing, these facilities will add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to Platform Equinix, with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions,\u201d it added.\n\nMainOne owns and operates a subsea network from Nigeria to Portugal, as well as 1,200 kilometers of reliable terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese are all improving connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries and the major business communities in Nigeria. When completed, this acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa, giving organisations based inside and outside of Africa access to one of the world\u2019s fastest growing markets,\u201d it stated.\n\nSpeaking about the planned acquisition, President and CEO, Equinix, Charles Meyers, said: \u201cThe acquisition of MainOne will represent a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly growing African market.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa. \u201cGrowth of data consumption in Africa is amongst the fastest in the world, and our customers are looking for a trusted partner to pursue the opportunities presented by broad mobile adoption and greater connectivity across the region.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Opeke said: \u201cEquinix will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa. I thank our founding shareholders led by Mr. Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, AFC, PAIDF, FBN, Polaris and AfDB for investing in the MainOne vision to bridge the digital divide in Africa.\n\n\u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have jointly built in twelve years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey. The MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition, and we look forward to building our next chapter together.\u201d\n\nThe President, EMEA, Equinix, Eugene Bergen also said the expansion in Africa, \u201chas long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets, but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cCEO Funke Opeke and her team have built a powerful and dynamic infrastructure that will enable international customers\u2019 access to the continent and African organisations access to the global Equinix platform.\n\n\u201cCustomers can take full advantage of Equinix\u2019s leading global interconnection services to connect with customers and partners, participate in rich digital ecosystems and expand their business across Africa and around the world,\u201d he added.\n\nUnder the terms of the transaction, the management team, including Opeke, would continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\nOpeke holds a master\u2019s in engineering from Columbia University and was named one of the World\u2019s Top 50 Women in Tech by Forbes in 2018 for her efforts in sparking internet adoption.

          "text": "\u2022Facility to save $7bn annual medical tourism spending, says Oramah\n\nDeji Elumoye and\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday conducted the official take-off of the planned $300 million African Medical Centre of Excellence (AMCE) to be implemented in Abuja by the Benedict Oramah-led African Export\u2013Import Bank (Afreximbank).\n\nAt the event which he attended virtually, the president who decried the rising cases of non-communicable diseases like cancer, noted that unfortunately, West African countries lacked the wherewithal to deal with such aliments.\n\nAccording to Buhari, such ailments are now the highest contributors to non-communicable disease mortalities, representing more than 81 per cent of all NCD deaths in West Africa.\n\n\u201cCardiovascular ailments, cancers and haematological disorders have increasingly become matters of concern to public healthcare. The World Health Organisation (WHO) projects that deaths on the African continent attributable to cancer and diabetes are expected to rise over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe rising NCD burden coupled with inadequate medical infrastructure on the continent threatens the future of our people. Right now, many hospitals in the West African region are underfunded, underequipped, understaffed and relatively inaccessible to most patients especially from rural areas,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe president noted that inasmuch as the situation represents an opportunity for investment in African healthcare, it had not necessarily translated into increased investment activity in the most pressing areas that require intervention.\n\nHe explained that the problem was further exacerbated by the significant brain drain experienced by the continent, adding that the exodus of doctors and nurses to other continents had resulted in a significant gap between the required treatments for non-communicable and the available treatments and care.\n\n\u201cThe above challenges combine to create a regional health market with poor access to critical services and low perception of quality of care available,\u2019\u2019 the president noted.\n\nWhile lauding the bank, Buhari said the 500-bed specialist facility will provide services in the areas of oncology, cardiology, and haematology and will seek to address the significant shortage of clinical care options in the West African sub-region.\n\n\u201cThe AMCE demonstrates that Afreximbank is not only Africa\u2019s trade finance partner, but its a development partner,\u201d he said, adding that a stronger partnership with the private sector will help in improving health facilities and access in the country.\n\nAside Afreximbank , other partners in the project include Kings College Hospital, London, University of Winsconsin Teaching Hospital, USA and Christies Hospital, Manchester.\n\nAccording to the president, in addition to providing comprehensive care across the three critical care areas, the AMCE will offer educational services to develop talent and establish itself as a world-class research centre, in partnership with global institutions.\n\n\u201cThe success of the AMCE will pave the way for future investments and partnerships in the sector while raising the local standard of healthcare and providing a blueprint for quality of services required to address Nigeria\u2019s and Africa\u2019s healthcare and economic challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nOramah, in his remarks said the ceremony was one step towards self-reliance for Africa\u2019s health care delivery as the project will pool world-class technology and global talents, particularly the African diaspora.\n\nOramah noted that the 500-bed and estimated $300 million AMCE was conceived to promote intra-African medical tourism and reduce the outflow of over $7 billion annually in outbound medical tourism.\n\nHe added that the vision for the health centre was borne out of a personal experience he encountered following his recovery from a potentially life-threatening blood disorder.\n\nAside its services in the areas of diagnostics, oncology, haematology, cardiology and general healthcare services, he stated that another significant focus of the AMCE is to perform innovative and ground-breaking research, development and educational programmes in partnership with leading global institutions.\n\nIn addition, the bank said that the facility has the potential to establish the largest and most diverse biobank in West Africa enabling it to attract global and Pan-African partnerships making it a global point of reference and source of medical tourism in the region.\n\n\u201cIt will also offer residency, training and placement programmes such that physicians and students at local teaching hospitals will have opportunities to train under the expertise of its specialists and with the benefit of its AMCE\u2019s patient volumes.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with King\u2019s College Hospital will increase locally available clinical capabilities, provide education and training, relying on KCH\u2019s two centuries\u2019 of experience in providing specialist healthcare services, medicine, and medical research.\n\n\u201cAfreximbank will also set its sights on implementing a continent-wide plan of developing similar AMCEs with the aim of improving the quality of healthcare and health related research to cater for the African population,\u201d the African bank stated.\n\nThe Abuja AMCE is also expected to enhance service exports providing healthcare to over 50,000 people annually, promote employment and creating over 3,000 jobs during its construction and operational phases and conserve foreign exchange.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said all hands are on deck, with the inter-ministerial committee working to ensure that the project is actualised in a way that is beneficial to all parties.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has disclosed that it was engaging relevant stakeholders in a bid to resolve issues of identity management which would assist in solving the rising unclaimed dividends in the capital market as well as other issues.\n\nThe Director-General of the SEC, Lamido Yuguda, stated this during the presentation of the 2022 budget of the Commission before the House of Representatives Committee on Capital Markets and Institutions in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nHe explained that part of the problems of unclaimed dividends had to do with identity management, saying the Commission was engaging the registrars and increasing investors\u2019 education to stem the trend.\n\nAccording to Yuguda, the Commission has set up an identity management committee to harmonise various databases of investors and facilitate data accuracy in the market.\n\nHe said the committee was made up of SEC, the registrars, the stockbrokers, the issuing houses, the Central Securities Clearing System and the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) in addition to the e-dividend management committee.\n\nYuguda said the committee\u2019s assignment would address the challenges of identity management and help tackle some of the issues of unclaimed dividends, direct cash settlement and multiple subscriptions.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have engaged with the industry to see where the issues are. We have understood the problem better and we are working in collaboration with them to ensure that by the end of the first half of 2022 we will be able to report back to this committee some of the milestones achieved in solving some of these issues and we believe it will have a massive impact.\n\n\u201cWe need to transform our IT infrastructure as we superintendent over a market that is vast and technology driven. The Steering committee has started work and we are already looking at the proposals.\n\n\u201cSEC has been collaborating with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria to develop standards for commodities and the Commission has already held two workshops in Lagos and Kano, expressing the hope that it will make the nation\u2019s agricultural commodities acceptable the world over as well as create wealth for the country.\u201d\n\nThe DG also disclosed that the Commission recently approved the first electronic offer in the capital market for MTN.\n\nOn funding, the SEC boss stated that the Commission does not rely on the federal government for funding as it is self-funded, adding that the downturn in the capital market due to the ongoing pandemic has adversely affected the revenue of the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe budget of 2021 has been a huge departure from the past as we have worked on new sources of income and reduced our expenditures.

          "text": "\u2022Refuses to vacate restraining order\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, yesterday adjourned till December 13, for hearing in a motion seeking to temporarily halt the federal government from deducting funds in their bank accounts in payment of Paris Club Refund to consultants.\n\nThe adjournment was made after the court granted an exparte application by the governors to regularise their processes that were filled out of time.\n\nThe application was moved by Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, Mr. Jibrin Okutekpa.\n\nJustice Ekwo, then granted it as prayed and in addition ordered for substituted service on some of the defendants who have allegedly refused to accept court documents regarding the suit.\n\nMeanwhile the court held that its earlier order restraining the federal government from going ahead with its planned deduction from the states\u2019 account in respect of the said payment still subsists.\n\nThe court made the clarification after attempts to make the court vacate the restraining order failed.\n\nChief Woke Olanipekun who represented the 14th defendant had urged the court to vacate the November 5 order in line with the rules of the court.\n\nHis position was supported by some defendants, including, Olusola Oke.\n\nThey argued that by the practice direction of the court, the order of injunction ought to last for 14 days and that it should be deemed as expired and no longer in existence.\n\nBut Okutepa, argued to the contrary, stating that until the motion for interlocutory injunction was decided, the interim order shall be in force and binding on all parties.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Ekwo, advised parties in the matter to thread softly adding that the matter would be deligently determined.\n\nHe subsequently adjourned till December 13 to take all pending applications.\n\nSpeaking shortly after the court session, lawyer to the 10th and 11th defendants, Mr. Onyeka Nwokolo, expressed displeasure over the way and manner the Paris club refund was being politicised and used to blackmail some of the defendants.\n\nHe claimed that the states\u2019 legitimately and on their own volition issued power of attorney to some of the defendants to pursue the Paris Club refund on their behalf, with a condition that 10 percent of the recovered money would be paid insisting that the powered of attorney is binding on the parties.\n\nNwokolo urged the Plaintiffs to be honorable in implementing the contractual terms rather than foot dragging.\n\nThe senior lawyer revealed that a subsisting judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction has ordered the payment of the money to the contractors after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had investigated and confirmed the authenticity of the contract.\n\nThe governors of the 36 states had rushed to court following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s approval of the payment of the controversial $418 million to six creditors as judgment debts in their favour.\n\nThe beneficiaries included: Ned Nwoko \u2013 $142,028,941; Ted Iseghoghi Edwards -$159 million; Riok Nigeria Limited, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 $142,028,941.95 and Panic Alert System Limited and George Uboh \u2013 $47,831,920.\n\nBased on Buhari\u2019s approval, the Federal Ministry of Finance was also said to have directed the Debt Management Office (DMO) to commence issuance of promissory notes to the creditors.\n\nThe governors accused the president of approving the payment without considering their call for a forensic audit into the claims of the creditors.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, wages for formal-sector employees are paid monthly; in the informal sector, however, this is paid daily. Now, when salaried employees go broke between paydays, they have three options: borrow, take a loan, or request a salary advance. But loans, most times, come with exploitative interest rates and salary advance schemes could plunge an employee deeper into debt.\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution, founded by Nonso Onwuzulike, allows employees flexible access to their accrued salaries on any day of the month.\n\nRevising the payday cycle\n\nIn 2019, Onwuzulike started a recycling company in Accra, Ghana, to reduce plastic waste and enable plastic recycling in the capital city. While running the business, he hired waste collectors and placed them on a monthly payment schedule. However, these employees\u2014all of them coming from informal-sector backgrounds\u2014were unhappy about this. They were used to being paid after a job was completed, or at the end of the workday. The monthly payment cycle left them cash-strapped and unable to match their daily expenses to their income. Consequently, once salaries were paid at the end of the month, many of the workers quit the company in search of other employment.\n\nEager to stem the high attrition rate among the waste collection staff, the company switched from a monthly payment schedule to a flexible one, allowing the workers to be paid more frequently\u2014weekly or bi-weekly. The change increased their productivity and fewer workers jumped ship.\n\nIt was a light-bulb moment for Onwuzulike. He went on to survey 100 formal employees within his network to find out how often they ran out of cash before payday and what their employers did to alleviate their financial difficulties.\n\nOnwuzulike\u2019s original intention for Earnipay was to build a salary advance solution\u2014in keeping with similar solutions already in existence in Nigeria, some of them powered by traditional banks. But plans changed when the results of the 100-person survey showed that 90% of salaried employees would rather have flexible access to their accrued salaries.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need payday loans or salary advances to fund their lives; they just wish to be paid more frequently,\u201d Onwuzulike said on a call with TechCabal.\n\nEarnipay is currently in beta, with Onwuzulike serving as CEO, Busayo Oyetunji COO, and Joshua Ajayi CTO. As Onwuzulike tells TechCabal, all three of them consider themselves co-builders of the product.\n\n\u201cWorks like an ATM\u201d\n\nEarnipay is unavailable to individual employees, so employers need to sign up and onboard their staff. The Earnipay app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month. Earnipay funds the withdrawal.\n\nFor example, if one dips into their salary on the ninth day of the month, it means they\u2019re entitled to half the amount they\u2019ve earned for working nine days. At the end of the month, their employer deducts from their salary the amount withdrawn, uses it to refund Earnipay for initially funding that withdrawal, then pays the employee the balance as their salary for the month.\n\nTransaction-fee tiers are attached to withdrawals. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 attracts a fee of \u20a6500, and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 attracts a \u20a61,000 fee.\n\n\u201cIt works just like an ATM,\u201d Oyetunji said.\n\nIntersecting the formal and informal workforce\n\nThe informal sector makes up about 80.8% of the workforce in urban Africa. In Nigeria where Earnipay operates out of, the sector makes up over 70% of the workforce.\n\nWhen Earnipay piloted three months ago, Onwuzulike envisaged that the solution would be useful only for low-income staff and informal employees, but the income profile of the app\u2019s users vary, Onwuzulike claims. \u201cOne of our customers earns a million naira a month,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, 17 companies have signed onto the app as active users and their employees have used Earnipay over 400 times.\n\nNo doubt, there are upsides to shorter payment cycles. For example, an employee can see their salary breakdown from day to day on the app, and unlike a loan or salary advance, which are borrowed funds, an Earnipay withdrawal is earned wages.\n\nStill, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up here as well. For instance, an earner who is unable to manage their personal finances may end up dipping into their salary before payday for the most frivolous reasons, and even after receiving their salary balance at month end, may still struggle to control their spending.\n\nResponding to these concerns, Oyetunji said, \u201cThe main issue here is, we\u2019re not financially educated. Whether you get your money at the end of the month or access it [daily] as you work, if you\u2019re not financially disciplined, Earnipay may not make a difference to your spending habits.\u201d\n\nScaling up\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Africa\u2019s formal and informal economies took hits. Six percent of formal workers were out of work in Malawi, and in Nigeria, that figure climbed to as high as 45%. Now, as Africa adjusts to the reset forced on the entire world by the pandemic, financial well-being across all employment sectors has become more important than ever. \u201cWe\u2019re in a financial health pandemic,\u201d Oyetunji said. \u201cQuality of life is reduced because people can\u2019t fund their everyday needs. How can our expenses be on-demand yet access to salaries earned isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe Earnipay team began building the product in July, received pre-seed funding of an undisclosed amount in August, and took their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to market in September.\n\nCommenting on Earnipay\u2019s plans for 2022, Onwuzulike said, \u201cOur goal is to partner with employers to improve employee financial well-being. We provide tools for income earners to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life. In addition to flexible salary access, we provide financial education to advise employees on best practices to manage their finances, and other products to assist them daily.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After expanding into financial services last year at the back of a $10 million investment from International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Partech, TradeDepot, a Nigerian B2B eCommerce platform, has now raised $110 million in an equity and debt Series B funding round.\n\nThe fund will support the delivery of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services to 5 million SME retailers and drive further expansion of its merchant platform across the continent.\n\nIFC returned and led the equity round, with participation from Novastar, Sahel Capital, CDC Group, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investors, Partech and MSA Capital. The debt funding was led by Arcadia Funds.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTradeDepot started as a consulting firm in 2005 before pivoting into a product-led startup in 2016 to aid seamless milk distribution across Nigeria. Now, the platform is connecting consumer goods brands in Africa directly to a target market of several million retail outlets across the continent, and also providing micro-loans to retailers to enable them to buy more products.\n\nAccording to The World Bank, SMEs represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. In Africa, SME retailers generate $1 trillion in sales annually and contribute $2.6 trillion to the continent\u2019s nominal GDP. But these numbers are only a tiny representation of the sector\u2019s true potential and can\u2019t solve the problem of fragmented distribution networks and lack of access to financing.\n\nVia its ShopTopUp platform, TradeDepot is solving these two major problems, distributing needed goods to retailers and providing them with credit that allows them to stock their inventories and then pay as they sell the goods which have a repayment value of about 5% per month.\n\nTradeDepot has grown from over 40,000 merchants on its platform last year to more than 100,000 merchants. And it says this new funding will further expedite the delivery of its two unique offerings across its operating markets\u201410 cities in Nigeria including Lagos and Abuja, Accra in Ghana, and Johannesburg in South Africa.\n\nSpeaking about the new funding, Onyekachi Izukanne, CEO and co-founder of TradeDepot, said, \u201cWe remain super focused on making digital commerce and financing both accessible and affordable to neighbourhood retailers across key cities in Africa. We are delighted to be joined by an elite group of new investors and have IFC\u2019s Wale Ayeni and Brian Odhambo of Novastar joining our Board of Directors, to support us on this journey to drive growth and prosperity across the continent.\u201d\n\nA retailer navigating the ShopTopUp app\n\nIn 2021 alone, IFC committed a record $31.5 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of technology to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe informal sector is a large and critical part of Africa\u2019s economy, accounting for around 80% of jobs in the region,\u201d said Makhtar Diop, IFC\u2019s Managing Director. \u201cWe are excited to work with TradeDepot to leverage technology to help small businesses across the continent, particularly the many retailers led by women, access the resources they need to grow and scale.\u201d\n\nThe digitisation of SMEs continues to make headlines in Africa this year as startups in the sector like Nigerian Alerzo, Omnibiz, and Sabi have both raised big institutional funding to capture more market share. Similarly, in Northern Africa, Egypt-based Capiter and Appetito, and Morocco-based Chari are also scaling for more market share across the continent.\n\nIt\u2019s a large market, though, and there are still millions of informal businesses that predominantly function offline. But, as for TradeDepot, it wants to capture more than 5 million SMEs as it continues to leverage and expand its BNPL offering in the 12 cities it\u2019s currently operating in.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nThe payment for the shares on PrimaryOffer is facilitated by Flutterwave. In addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader",
          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Africa\u2019s tech-savvy population, financial exclusion is still a problem on the continent. But with the launch of fintech startups came the challenge of regulatory influence and industry acclimatisation.\n\nIn 2018, a financial expert and tech investor considered it stressful for fintech startups to integrate with banks \u2014 a necessary partnership for the former to enter the banking market successfully. On the other hand, banks need to collaborate with fintechs to increase their revenue and maintain market dominance.\n\nUndeterred by the hassles, Nigerian fintechs have multiplied, with the market growing exponentially, as seen in the increase in investments and frequency of new entrants into the space. Adedeji Olowe saw all this and decided to do something about the challenges in the industry.\n\n\u201cImagine if that pain is taken away entirely and you can easily integrate with any bank,\u201d Olowe said, snapping his fingers to indicate speed, \u201clike what takes years or months can be done in a day. When this happens, fintechs will spend more time delivering their services instead of trying to connect to a bank.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnable to resist bringing up open banking as we chatted in his Lekki Phase 1 home, he referred to it as his most daunting challenge in what can aptly be called a flourishing career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatting with Adedeji Olowe in his Lekki Phase 1 home\n\nThe father of three has helped many people build companies. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, was an early member of the TeamApt board and now an independent member of the Paystack board. He is also a board member of Nigerian digital bank, Sparkle. Olowe leads Trium, a venture capital firm, and is seen globally as the leader of open banking in Africa.\n\nDespite Africa being slow to enact open banking regulations like other developing regions, he believes now is the time to catch up with Europe and Asia.\n\nSpurred on by his belief, Olowe has taken it upon himself to seek structures that not only help banks and fintechs collaborate seamlessly but also make the process attractive for new entrants.\n\nDespite how much Adedeji has pushed for open banking regulations in the past four years, he maintains that he does not plan to profit from it. He chose not to patent it, preferring to be called a trustee.\n\nSatisfaction for Olowe would be found in the knowledge that his solution positively impacted people for years to come.\n\nPerhaps, the importance of this move isn\u2019t evident yet, but the height of its success would be every bank having the same application programming interface (API) such that it would be easy for any fintech company to integrate. Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll simplify everything later.\n\nAdedeji had achieved a lot before setting his sights on open banking and tech investment. Before we dive in, let\u2019s look at where he is coming from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA background that paid off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nRaised by an academic mom in Southwestern Nigeria, Adedeji bagged his first degree in electrical engineering in 2001. And in the middle of a thriving banking career ten years later, he got a Master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Kings College, London.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent all my life in financial services; I\u2019ve never worked as an engineer,\u201d he stated.\n\nStill, he didn\u2019t forget to add how he owes his current exploits to his academic and exemplary upbringing.\n\nAdedeji\u2019s career trajectory has been steady in its upward and forward climb. So far in his journey, he has taken somewhat uncalculated risks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a curious kid, and my curiosity has always gotten me into trouble. And I\u2019ve always loved to write,\u201d he confessed as he remembered simpler days when he considered his writing as \u201cletters to abuse people,\u201d for which he was spanked many times.\n\nAdedeji\u2019s blog has many articles explaining topical issues in banking and financial inclusion and tech adoption.\n\nSome of his write-ups contain fintech predictions for the year, which he began in 2017. He has an uncanny knack for accurate fintech predictions but is yet to record 100% accuracy. Olowe delivers his predictions matter-of-factly and calls them \u201ceducated guesses, at best.\u201d\n\nCareer track marked with passion and excellence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nIn two decades, Adedeji has risen from an entry-level position in a commercial bank to executive roles in the sector and now heads a venture capitalist firm. After his first two moves, companies sought him for the value he could bring to the table.\n\nAdedeji regularly took the initiative. For instance, in his first stint at Standard Trust Bank as an entry-level member on the e-banking team, he built an intranet \u2014 an internal website \u2014 to fill a gap without being asked to.\n\nTwo years later, at Access Bank, his team built a data analytics system that guarantees easy information access within a bank.\n\nFor some reason, Adedeji often felt the need to prove his worth and take risks. He recalled his best career move yet while at United Bank of Africa (UBA), where he worked for over six years, the longest of all the seven financial institutions he worked with.\n\n\u201cI first worked in finance, and from there, I went back to digital banking. That was when I was in charge of all the card products in UBA across 19 countries. And at that time, I did not know anything about cards, but I always loved to challenge myself. And in about seven months, I became an expert, one of the best. That was a difficult period for me not only because of the demand, but it forced me to grow.\u201d\n\nHe attributes this success to his consistency and obsession with learning, which stood him in good stead for a stint outside Africa before finally focusing on fintech and tech investment.\n\nApart from admitting to a constant need to make an impact by seeking new challenges, Adedeji was deliberate about his career strategy, which was responsible for his steady climb.\n\n\u201cFirst, I was good,\u201d he said quite frankly, \u201cthen, secondly, I moved around.\u201d\n\nThis explains why he had an impact record in many Nigerian banks.\n\n\u201cWhen you move, you get the next thing. When you stay, you\u2019re waiting for the next promotion, which takes longer.\u201d\n\nPausing to add a disclaimer, he said, \u201cThere are risks to it as well. Because if you\u2019re in a good place and you\u2019re greedy and jump to a bad place, you might actually be screwed over.\u201d\n\nPutting it in perspective, like Adedeji\u2019s career shows, being exceptional ultimately does the trick because you would often be called upon for a higher challenge once you have outstanding potential.\n\n\u201cI was solving problems around me instead of joining people to complain about a problem. That\u2019s how I grew.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nHe was emphatic in declaring that this strategy, coupled with work excellence, helped him rise to a senior managerial position in banking in under seven years, something that would ordinarily take twice as long if he remained at one bank.\n\nEmbodying open banking\n\nAdedeji\u2019s journey got even more interesting after 2017 when he decided he was done working in banks. Again, his curiosity and desire to apply himself led him to a more significant challenge with the potential to influence Africa\u2019s financial industry immensely for many years to come.\n\nHe realised, rather disturbingly, the need for all banks to speak the same language after working at SystemSpecs, one of Nigeria\u2019s earliest fintech companies, as an executive director.\n\n\u201cThe first problem I found out was most banks don\u2019t have APIs. The second problem, even when they have APIs doing the same thing, two banks don\u2019t solve a problem the same way. The third? There\u2019s no standardised way for everyone to have access to the APIs.\u201d\n\nOnce all banks can have the same APIs and easy guidelines to access them, a new fintech would only need to understand the API standard, and any code that it writes would work seamlessly with any bank.\n\nEnter open banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new fintech looking to integrate with five different banks with entirely different standards would have to go through a highly time-consuming and intensive process. This is where open banking comes in to take the stress away and save the day.\n\nAdedeji clarifies that open banking is not a technology but a standard.\n\nSimplifying it, he compares open banking to a standard where every bank is required to have an electrical socket type of a particular shape, say, circular holes, and every fintech has plugs with circular points that fit perfectly.\n\nThis means any fintech coming into the market can connect easily without getting a multipurpose adapter or connecting wires directly to outlets.\n\nBut this is easier said than done.\n\n\u201cOne, all the banks have to like the idea. And CBN has to create a rule,\u201d Olowe explained why he almost grew cold feet at the beginning.\n\nHe decided to take the first step on June 1, 2017, just before midnight. He sent an email with a call to action, \u201cLet there be open banking!\u201d to all his friends.\n\nAlthough he received acceptance from friends and other persons of interest, including the CBN, in the following months, there have been many rejections.\n\nAdedeji is pleased that the biggest hurdle is out of the way already \u2014 getting CBN on board \u2014 which means the work is 80% completed. Fortunately, a CBN directive to that effect was released in February, called the \u201cRegulatory Framework on Open Banking in Nigeria.\u201d What is ongoing is creating a standard.\n\nBut he still refers to championing open banking as his highest achievement, \u201cbecause that is me driving something that I\u2019m not going to benefit from, but it will benefit a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAlthough he\u2019s not expecting any monetary gains from this, it would positively impact the investment sector where he now plays. So, win-win.\n\nNot stopping here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nAdedeji has grand plans to solve more than one problem for Nigerians. He dreams of building a school for intensive training in vocational studies and creative and tech skills in rural areas in Nigerian cities where indigents can study on a scholarship. This is on the premise that not everyone is fit for the walls of a tertiary institution, and everyone deserves a better life.\n\nIf he isn\u2019t thinking of tinkering and building stuff, he is curious about human genetic make-up (DNA), metacognition, and the sense of being aware. Adedeji\u2019s hobby is travelling, and having visited thirty countries, he\u2019s thinking of getting a helicopter to fly around Lagos State.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Since then, the company has served over 800 businesses in three Nigerian states. With most Nigerian founders being male, the company\u2019s success is even more impressive when you consider when it was founded.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, MainOne will have access to Equinix\u2019s infrastructure and serve as Equinix\u2019s route to enter the African market. In addition, Opeke and other top management staff would remain in their roles.\n\nRead more: US-based Equinix to acquire Nigeria\u2019s MainOne for $320m\n\nHow Flow is automating real estate advertising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Levy and Gil Sperling. Co-founders, Flow\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, the first thing you do once you wake up is to grab your phone and scroll through your favourite social media app. It could be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn.\n\nAccording to reports, the average user spends about seven hours on social media daily. That\u2019s about a third of the day. So it\u2019s no surprise that businesses are tapping into these habits.\n\nMost businesses would instead advertise on social media than traditional media outlets. Yeah, real estate businesses left the chat. Daniel Levy (not Tottenham\u2019s chairman) and Gil Sperling are building Flow to help property companies automate their social media advertising.\n\nHow do they do this?\n\nFlow uses an API to do this for real estate businesses. Real estate agents simply log in to Flow\u2019s web portal, where they pick the properties they wish to list, and an ad is automatically created.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlready, the startup is serving 4,000 real estate agents \u2014 a number that is reportedly 10% of the real estate agents working in the country. In addition, it plans to expand beyond South Africa in the coming years, kickstarting with a move into Australia announced yesterday, December 7, 2021.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo has more on this story, which you\u2019ll find on the website later today.\n\nHAVAIC\u2019s plan for funding African startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 TEDx Talk, Kola Aina, Founder of Ventures Platform queried somewhat rhetorically, \u201cWho will own our future unicorns?\u201d He pointed out that while African startups were getting attention from investors, they were mostly foreigners.\n\nThat trend has continued, and Techpoint Africa\u2019s Nigerian Startup Report shows that about 71% of investments in Nigerian startups came from outside Africa.\n\nBarely two years after Aina\u2019s TEDx Talk, payment startup, Paystack was acquired by US-based payments company, Stripe.\n\nFortunately, more Africans have taken up Aina\u2019s challenge and are backing more startups. These are early days, but it might only be a matter of time before we have unicorns majorly owned by Africans.\n\nFor this week\u2019s edition of Angels & VCs, we had a chat with Ian Lessem, the Managing Partner at HAVAIC and one of the few African investors. He reveals how the firm started and its process for investing in startups.

          "text": "More than $4 billion of funding has been raised by start-ups in Africa through 754 deals and Nigeria ranks highest among the top four including South Africa, Egypt and Kenya, with $1.41 billion.\n\nDespite this feat, Nigeria has dropped from Africa\u2019s top 10 investment destinations to 14 as Egypt remains the number one nation.\n\nThis is according to a report by RMB, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited, titled \u2018Where to Invest in Africa 2021\u2019. The report positions Morocco as second and South Africa in third place, Rwanda and Botswana, now in fourth and fifth position respectively.\n\nBased on their operating environments, other countries have moved up the rankings as Rwanda and Botswana occupy the fourth and fifth position respectively, while Ghana, Mauritius, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya and Tanzania are the last five.\n\nFor Nigeria, RMB attributed its 14th position on the list to constraints on the nation\u2019s economy by a weak policy environment and sore infrastructure provision.\n\nHowever, the company said Nigeria\u2019s heavy reliance on oil is impacting its economy. \u201cNigeria\u2019s heavy reliance on oil means that the drop in oil prices and production generated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 agreement is strongly impacting the economy. COVID-19 came at a time when the economy was still rebalancing from the drop in oil prices during the 2014 to 2016 period.\u201d\n\nRead also: Again, Nigeria\u2019s effort at salvaging electoral process at risk\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Nigeria was ranked in the top 10 \u2013 eighth in both years, 13 in 2017, and ranked number six in 2016.

          "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic-related school closures have been estimated to cost this generation of students $17 trillion in lifetime earnings, or about 14 percent of today\u2019s global GDP, according to a new report by the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF.\n\nThe new projection far exceeds the $10 trillion estimated in 2020, revealing that the impact of the closures is more severe than previously estimated.\n\nAccording to the report, this will likely increase learning poverty and have a devastating effect on their future productivity.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 crisis brought education systems across the world to a halt,\u201d said Jaime Saavedra, global director for education at the World Bank.\n\n\u201cNow, 21 months later, schools remain closed for millions of children, and others may never return to school. The loss of learning that many children are experiencing is morally unacceptable. And the potential increase of Learning Poverty might have a devastating impact on future productivity, earnings, and well-being for this generation of children and youth, their families, and the world\u2019s economies, \u201d Saavedra said.\n\nRead also: We returned 54,000 Out-of-School children to classrooms in 2yrs \u2013 Oyo Education Board\n\nAccording to the report, the share of children being unable to read and understand a simple text by age 10 which was 53 percent before the pandemic could potentially reach 70 percent given the long school closures and the ineffectiveness of remote learning to ensure full learning continuity during school closures.\n\nThe report also shows that many school children may never return to school post-crisis.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures reduced children\u2019s school attendance probabilities by nearly 7 percentage points. Students aged 15-18, for whom education is no longer compulsory, were 11 percentage points less likely to go back to school,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThere are about 14 million out-of-school children and Nigeria\u2019s abduction epidemic only exacerbates the situation.\n\nIn the past year in Nigeria, more than 600 schools have been closed and 1,000 children kidnapped, according to UNICEF\n\nThe report shows a similar trend in other emerging countries with girls at heightened risk.\n\nFor example, fathers in Nigeria reported actively discouraging their daughters but not their sons from using the internet and were less likely to assist their daughters\u2019 learning through technology during COVID-19. Gendered demands on girls\u2019 time, including increased responsibilities at home, impede their ability to engage in remote learning and lead to less time for schoolwork\n\nData from Bangladesh show that one in ten girls aged 12-15 reported not going back to school once systems reopened after COVID-19 induced school closures.\n\nIn Brazil, one in ten students aged 10-15 is also not planning to return to school while in Ghana, where national re-enrollment was high at 97 percent, 60 percent of the dropouts were girls.\n\nIn Chile, early simulations from the Ministry of Education indicated that dropout rates might double, increasing from 2.6 percent to 5 percent.\n\nThe drop-out cases countries are experiencing were similar to when the Ebola crisis struck in 2013.\n\nAfter the crisis, 27 percent of Liberian secondary school students did not return to formal education while in Sierra Leone, when schools reopened after Ebola, girls ages 12\u201317 were 16 percentage points less likely to be in school.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic shut down schools across the world, disrupting education for 1.6 billion students at its peak, and exacerbated the gender divide,\u201d said UNICEF Director of Education Robert Jenkins.\n\nIn some countries, we\u2019re seeing greater learning losses among girls and an increase in their risk of facing child labor, gender-based violence, early marriage, and pregnancy. To stem the scars on this generation, we must reopen schools and keep them open, target outreach to return learners to school, and accelerate learning recovery,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nThe report also highlights that, to date, less than 3 percent of governments\u2019 stimulus packages have been allocated to education. Much more funding will be needed for immediate learning recovery.\n\nMore than 200 million learners live in low- and lower-middle-income countries that are unprepared to deploy remote learning during emergency school closures, the report stated.\n\nThe institutions have stated that reopening schools must remain a top and urgent priority globally to stem and reverse learning losses.\n\n\u201cCountries should put in place Learning Recovery Programs with the objective of assuring that students of this generation attain at least the same competencies of the previous generation,\u201d the report stated.\n\nThey further recommend that programs cover three key lines of action to recover learning which are, consolidating the curriculum, extending instructional time, and improving the efficiency of learning.",

          "title": "JAILBREAKS AND YEMI ADEBOWALE NEGATIVE CRITICISM \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThere have been coordinated and planned attacks on military, police formations and correctional centres. Yemi Adebowale did not call for the removal of minister of defence or police affairs. Yemi Adebowale hated Aregbesola as governor of Osun State and he has been a paid agent of the opposition in Osun State.Yemi Adebowale is mischievous and purblind about recent security and correctional service developments. Yemi Adebowale used Thisday Newspaper platform to fight Aregbesola as governor of Osun State. The management of Thisday Newspaper should be careful about the character of Yemi Adebowale because he is always a paid agent of the devil. Yemi Adebowale is ignorant of the security situation and spate of security challenges in the country. He is not reasonable and patriotic. He has no sense of worry and concern. More worrisome is Yemi Adebowale negative criticism of Aregbesola.\n\nYemi Adebowale is unaware that of late, there had been series of attacks on military, police and correctional centres facilities. The gory attacks on police stations and other government institutions are launched to strike fear. There are only twelve jailbreaks in five years compare to thousands of attacks on military and police facilities. There are more attacks on military and police facilities than correctional centres. Adebowale is ignorant of the fact that the military and police provide security for our correctional centres across Nigeria. Correctional centres are not operating in isolation. We can count the attacks on correctional centres but the attacks on military and police facilities are countless.\n\nThe attacks on Nigeria Defence Academy, correctional centres etc are part of security challenges facing Nigeria. Nigeria is faced with an unprecedented wave of different but overlapping security crises \u2013 from kidnapping to extremist insurgencies \u2013 almost every corner of the country has been hit by violence and crime and these pose a great danger to our correctional centres. The scale of the insecurity threatens the very fabric of Nigerian society: \u201cWith every attack, human lives are lost or permanently damaged and faith in democracy and the country is diminishing. Between 2016 and 2021 more than 3,000 prisoners/inmates have been illegally freed from Nigeria correctional centres due to coordinated attacks and security challenges. In five months, 10 correctional centres have been attacked. In November, 2020 while counting the costs of the #ENDSARS protests, Information Minister Lai Mohammed had said eight prisons were attacked, \u201cwith 1,957 inmates set free and 31 staff injured. Aregbesola became Minister of Interior in 2019 and he is working hard to prevent future attacks on correctional facilities.\n\nYemi Adebowale must study and ask 19 state governors in the north to as a matter of urgency study and implement Osun 2014 security architecture to tackle kidnapping and bandits. With the Osun security architecture, Rauf Aregbesola purchased Helicopter for Aerial Security Surveillance and presentation of more sophisticated 25 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC) to the Nigerian Police Force, a feat that has never been achieved by any government in the 36 states. The procurement of the helicopter and the APC was the security architecture that particularly drove away many undesirable elements from the state. I challenge any state governor to prove me wrong. The lesson from Osun 2014 security strategy is that former Governor Aregbesola Strengthened the effectiveness of the Nigeria Police Force which required improving trust with local communities and better responding to citizens\u2019 security needs. Doing so requires systemic reforms in the governance and accountability. Tackling modern security threats in Osun, then, was directly tied with improving the governance and oversight of the security sector, especially the police in Osun State. This is the security architecture President Buhari needs now in north-west and north-east.\n\nOsun 2014 security architecture does not left issues of security at the door step of federal government but fill the gap between the security agencies. Former governor Rauf Aregbesola used the security architecture to equip and motivate the security agencies in Osun to stop armed robbery and other security challenges in Osun. Osun 2014 security architecture will assist President Buhari and northern governors to checkmate kidnapping, banditry and others. Osun 2014 security architecture will tackle terrorists in the North East, bandits in North West and Central. Nigeria has, in recent years, witnessed a rise in banditry across the country, including in the north-western states of Sokotom Zamfara and Katsina\n\nI must blame the menace of correctional centres congestion on the nature of criminal justice system in Nigeria. Criminal justice system encompasses all the paraphernalia of justice system in Nigeria; ranging from police, court, correctional centres and other law enforcement agencies. Investigation takes about weeks or months to conclude and when a matter is concluded on investigation and brought to court for trial, if charges are not filed against them in a court of competent jurisdiction you see there will be delay. Minister of Interior is working round the clock within his constitutional powers to decongest correctional centres. Recently, Aregbesola called on the 36 states governors to sign death warrants. In recent years, there are calls for death penalty due to increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery and terrorism. This is the time in Nigeria when we need the death sentence more than another time. Between October,2020 to date 3,000 inmates have escaped from Nigeria Correctional Service yet states governors have refused to sign death warrants of 3,008 inmates condemned by courts.\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola is facing a dilemma when state governors are against calls for the signing of the death warrants for 3,008 death row inmates in correctional centres across Nigeria. The minister had on July 23 accused the state governors of delaying the wheel of justice and contributing to congestion in correctional centres by refusing to sign the death warrants.\n\nAregbesola is facing dilemma over what to do with the 3,008 criminals in Nigeria Correctional Centres that have been condemned to death by the courts. The silent moratorium by state governors which borders on their unwillingness to endorse death sentences of condemned criminals is a big problem to Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior.\n\nThe slow pace of justice dispensation in the country which is attributable to long and, sometimes, mischievous adjournment of cases which has led to non-dispensation of most cases thereby abandoning the inmates in prisons, inadequate funding of the judiciary, slow investigation process by the police. Unfortunately, due to the inherent lapses in the system, the correctional centres system which is supposed to be reformatory has eventually turned to punitive, thereby defeating the true essence of sending convicts to prisons. The implication of this reversed system of prison administration is that the inmates of our correctional centres come out more criminally minded than they were before conviction.\n\nRauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior is bringing reliable field-proven technology backed by professional expertise to safeguard correctional facilicities and detention centres across Nigeria within the available resources. The technology will enable guards to monitor and track inmates, detect illegal activities, isolate and control violent incidents and prevent intrusion to secure correctional centres. But finance is the major problem of Aregbesola to execute his security plans for Nigeria correctional centres.\n\nThe federal government is putting in place enhanced security measures in correctional centres, a slew of advanced equipment to further strengthen the existing arrangements. Aregbesola has planned for Security-related gadgets such as scanners, cell phone jammers and closed circuit television cameras, besides walkie-talkie sets for faster communication, have to be procured.\n\nAlongside improving security measures, the federal government is also putting in place many innovative schemes in correctional centres aimed at rehabilitating inmates and turning them into productive citizens upon their release.\n\nFortifying security at correctional centres\n\nHowever, the authorities of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) say they are doing everything possible within the resources that are available to fortify security at their facilities across the country. Sophisticated weapons, Armored Personnel Carriers (APC) and others have been acquired to prevent further attacks. Aregbesola is working with other security agencies to prevent attacks on correctional facilities. They will provide Armored Personnel Carriers (APC) and some other sophisticated weapons that can help us to fortify correctional facilities. \u201cFor intelligence gathering, the services involved have also been forthcoming. We are increasing our reach and collaboration to ensure that these incidents do not occur again. \u201cSome of these facilities that have been attacked, they are located in areas that are now surrounded by private developers. These correctional facilities are supposed to have what we call buffer areas. And the buffer area is not supposed to be less than 200 meters round the correctional facilities.\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Abuja\n\n...",

The party belongs to all of us. This is the first time in our history when the government will move to a senatorial district to perform a vital ceremony like this.\n\n\u201cNot everything will be done in Benin City; those things you deserve will come and meet you at home. We are moving politics to the people because the people voted us to power.\u201d\n\nNoting that he did not interfere in the selection process for the appointees, Obaseki said, \u201cThe way they gave me the list was how we published the names and appointed you all. We have put an end to godfatherism.\n\n\u201cThose giving appointments are those living at home, not in Benin City. If you know anyone we appoint, and not based or living here, such a person should be reported and he or she will be removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of you moved with us during our campaign last year and we made promises after listening to problems and challenges. You need to help us use the available resources to fulfill our promises and you have to help us with information to achieve our plans,\u201d the governor further charged the appointees.\n\nObaseki said the appointment is not a favour from him but a call to more service following their hard work, commitment and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t accept that somebody helped you to be on that list. Don\u2019t collect your salaries and give them to any godfather. The money is yours, utilize it well and work for your people. Join me to reset the State to make it an envy of all,\u201d he urged.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cSecurity is a major concern and one of the Senior Special Assistants must be responsible for coordinating all the security reports in each local government.\n\n\u201cWe have focused on political development in Edo North as it is treated as a special axis with three Political Advisers against one in Edo South and Central senatorial districts. We are working to make PDP dominate in Edo North.\n\n\u201cWe are working and taking politics to the next level as we are using politics to develop our people and our place. Politics that doesn\u2019t change the lives of our people for the better is bad politics. We want to use our party to deliver services to our people as Edo must be great again.\u201d\n\nChairman of PDP in Edo State, Anthony Aziegbemi who thanked party leaders in Edo North for ensuring harmonization of the party, urged them to ensure that more people are registered through the party\u2019s e-registration process.\n\nResponding on behalf of other appointees, Yakubu Gowon promised to support the Obaseki-led administration in actualising the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda.\n\n...",

We have understood the problem better and we are working in collaboration with them to ensure that by the end of the first half of 2022 we will be able to report back to this committee some of the milestones achieved in solving some of these issues and we believe it will have a massive impact.\u201d\n\nThe SEC boss disclosed that the Commission is also working to combat challenges confronting the Commission on Information Technology.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need to transform our IT infrastructure as we superintendent over a market that is vast and technology driven. The Steering committee has started work and we are already looking at the proposals.\u201d\n\nYuguda said the SEC has been collaborating with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria to develop standards for commodities and the Commission has already held two workshops in Lagos and Kano, expressing the hope that it will make the nation\u2019s agricultural commodities acceptable the world over as well as create wealth for the country.\n\nThe DG also disclosed that the Commission recently approved the first electronic offer in the capital market for MTN.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBefore now, we had rules on electronic offers which we developed but they are only being used now with the MTN offer. These are some of the achievements the Commission has been able to record recently.\u201d\n\nOn funding, the SEC boss stated that the Commission does not rely on the Federal Government for funding as it is self-funding adding that the downturn in the capital market due to the ongoing pandemic has adversely affected the revenue of the Commission.\n\nHe said \u201cThe budget of 2021 has been a huge departure from the past as we have worked on new sources of income and reduced our expenditures. With these efforts, we know that we will have a Commission that everyone will be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe DG commended the Chairman and the Committee members for their unwavering support to the Commission and the capital market.\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Babangida Ibrahim commended the Commission on its efforts so far and assured that the committee would continue to provide support where necessary to ensure that the nation has a vibrant capital market.\n\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to oversight the SEC and that is why we invited them here today to brief us on the performance of their 2021 budget, including the success and challenges they have faced in the year under review. We will continue to engage with the Commission to attain the progress we desire for our capital market\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

Statistics in Kenya show that it is less than seven percent the same with South Africa. Kenya is as rural as Nigeria so what have we done to learn from them.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows the story of M-pesa and we even have a companies such as eTranzact that is as powerful as Mpesa but how do we unlock it. So going forward, we need to develop platforms and products that talk to economic and social characteristics of unbanked or excluded population.\n\n\u201cWhere are they, who are they, how do they currently live their life and what do they like. Even for those of us in the investment world are we designing products to suit these people, are we reducing our products to the lowest denomination, the sachet sized model.\n\n\u201cNigeria is driven by the informal sector with 65 per cent of GDP is in the informal sector, for us to catch these people, we need to go lower.\n\nKenya through the M-pesa which is the non-bank mobile money framework, was able to bring financial services even in the hinterlands with market women in the farms having access to payment systems, savings and investments.\n\n\u201cHere we are talking about capital market, a small aspect of financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cInsurance, pension are also aspects of financial inclusion that we should be exploring, if we are going to grow this market and improve through technology, meet them where they are.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed the need to reach out to the financially excluded through technology saying \u201cthese are the people that need health, so we move into health tech, food tech or agric tech.\n\n\u201cWe have stockbroking firms with minimum account opening of N5 million but then we also have those with minimum of zero balance and that is the sachet size model I am talking about.\n\n\u201cEven big men in Nigeria want to buy things that are very small and we have to replicate the sachet size model in the capital market. It has worked in everything it is applied to in this country so why don\u2019t we in the capital market adopt it,\u201d Onadele said.\n\nHe said market stakeholders needed to design investment products to align with financial inclusion strategies to get to the hinter land.\n\nOnadele added that the exchange will in the first quarter of next year unveil new products tailored to meeting the investing needs of the masses.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Atteh applied to the Court that the documents, which the counsel claimed were the results of the COVID tests, be filed in the Court and served on the prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution will subsequently apply under Section 235 (4) of the Lagos State Administration of Criminal Justice (Amendment) Law 2021 for the defendant to be tried in absentia, if he still fails to appear in Court,\u201d Atteh added.\n\nJustice Oyefeso, thereafter, ordered the defendant to file an affidavit in Court attaching the said documents, which he claimed were the results of the said COVID tests, and also serve them on the prosecution.\n\nThe Court also ordered that the defendant should undergo another test at the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, Yaba on December 6, 2021 and file the result in Court within 48 hours.\n\nThe case was adjourned till February 15, 2022 for continuation of trial.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

While handing the cheques to the winners, who were successful in a business pitch, Polaris Bank\u2019s Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Innocent C. Ike, disclosed that the most important factor required by existing and budding entrepreneurs to get investors interested in their businesses is the entrepreneurial spirit. Aside the business pitch winners, special prizes were also given to the Most Original Store and Best Decorated Store at the Fashion Souk. The winners were given equipment grants by Polaris Bank to further expand their businesses. The overall winner of the pitch, Mrs. Oluwatosin Ogunbanjo, who runs a leather bag and shoes company, Avenue 7, got N750,000 and first runner-up, Victoria Udoh, a painting on Fabric Company, Vudoh was given N500,000 while the second runner-up, Tunde Issa, a Tailor and Founder of male clothing line company, RoyalKlassicKoutoure, went home with N250,000. The hugely attended one-day Fashion Souk/business fair which held at the prestigious Harbour Point facility in Victoria Island, Lagos, on Sunday, provided a platform for more than 150 SMEs in Nigeria\u2019s fashion industry to showcase their creativity, product lines, and economic potentials. Some of the SMEs categories at the fair included: manufacturers, retailers, leather and jewelry/accessories. The objective of sponsoring the Fashion Souk according to Polaris Bank, was a reinforcement of its support to SMEs as the catalyst for propelling the growth of the Nigerian economy. Shedding more light on how fundamental entrepreneurial spirit is for a business success, the Polaris Bank CEO said he has a habit of telling entrepreneurs that what makes the difference, \u201cIs the creative idea that an entrepreneur has and the ability to sit down and put it together diligently in a well-articulated manner.\u201d He added that \u201cCreative ideas are the only way to attract funding from banks and individuals who will like to invest in the idea because they will see clearly that it is viable. He said the only way an entrepreneur can achieve that is by sitting down and putting his thoughts together and by making sure he crosses all the T\u2019s and dots all the I\u2019s.\u201d According the Polaris Bank CEO, \u201cWhen such a business proposal is presented to any investor Bank, it will be very convincing and such an entrepreneur will not get a \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.\u201d Earlier in her address too, Chairman of Eventful/Convener of the Event, Mrs. Yewande Zaccheus, appreciated Polaris Bank for consistently supporting SMEs in the country over the years, remarking that the Bank is not only talking but actually putting its money where its mouth is and urged the Bank to sustain the Partnership for a sustainable Fashion Souk. Highlight of the Fashion Souk was the product launch that SMEs could leverage the Bank\u2019s loan products like: Polaris Business Loan, Invoice Discounting facility and LPO financing among others were pitched with the participating SMEs. The Bank has developed SME-friendly products to cater to the needs of SMEs based on sector/industry-specific, ranging from SMEs in the Health sector, Education, Manufacturing, General business, Agriculture, Export, Creative Industry, etc.\u201d Polaris Bank also provides business advisory at no cost while SMEs are encouraged to send in their business proposal for review via- [email protected] Aside Polaris Bank, the fashion fair also featured product launches by other top participating Fashion companies like Arami, Tara, Mobos and Zaron; as well as runways by Clatural, Aaboux/Cornocupia, Woora and Dyelab, among others.

          "title": "RMRDC: Breaking new ground in malaria cure",
          "text": "Due to the consistent outbreak of malaria resulting in death of millions in Africa annually, the Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC) recently broke new grounds when it developed a plant to cure malaria; BINTA SHAMA reports.\n\n\n\n\u2018Artemisia annua\u2019\n\nArtemesia annua also known as qinghao (sweet wormwood, A. annua yields artemisinin and its derivatives which are potent antimalarial drugs), is a medicinal plants which originated from China. Research, shows that it is an endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone that is effective against multi-drug resistance malaria and is also known to act on P. falciparum, the plasmadium species that causes cerebral malaria. Arteminsinin is a highly effective antimalarial plant extract. However, if used alone, it is observed that malaria parasite cannot be eradicated totally to resistance against arteminsinin.\n\nThe malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum is said to be one of the world\u2019s most lethal pests, accounting for over a million deaths per year. Ninety per cent of malaria cases are in sub-saharan Africa, 85% of these are in children under the ages of 5 years. For over 50 years, study shows that the main tool for controlling the malaria parasite was chloroquine, a synthetic derivative of the plant-based extract quinine. Chloroquine acts as both prophylactic and cure and has the advantage of very low cost ($0.10 per treatment), but unfortunately, in much of Africa as well as South-East Asia, it is no longer effective due to the emergence of resistant strains of the malaria parasite. Malaria has enormous economic costs and was reported to account for 40% of public health costs in Africa, it costs Africa $12 billion of its Gross Domestic Production (GDP) annually. WHO\u2019s estimate put the mortally rate of malaria for children under five in Africa at 729 per 100,000. This is why the development of A. annual is being pursued assiduously at global level.\n\nAccording to further research, globally, Nigeria suffers the greatest malaria burden with approximately 51 million cases and 207,000 deaths reported annually (approximately 30 % of the total malaria burden in Africa), while 97% of the total population (approximately 173 million) is at risk of the infection. Nigeria is said to account for nearly a quarter of deaths from malaria in the world \u2013 in 2018 the numbers stood at 95,000. Three of the country\u2019s top malaria researchers reflect on why the numbers remain so high.\n\nImportance of artemisinin\n\nAccording to research work conducted by the Council, that artemisinin was first isolated in 1972 and has served as a prototype for many semi-synthetic versions such as arteether and artemether. These compounds have increased solubility in vaccines and have improved antimalarial activities. Artemisinin proved to be an excellent antimalarial agent, and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are currently the preferred first-line antimalarial treatment for plasmodium falciparum. Artemisinin\u2019s unusual endoperoxide bridge is a key to its mechanism of action-although the details of this mechanism are still being sorted out. Artemisinin and its derivatives are highly effective against multi-drug resistant parasites and result in rapid clearance of parasitemia and clinical improvement, usually within 24 to 36 hours. They are well tolerated and safe in adults, children and pregnant women. They also have a broad spectrum of antimalarial efficacy and, in particular, show good activity against the young ring forms of the parasite that halts their development into the more mature pathogenic stages. These properties are especially important for the management of severe malaria.\n\nArtemisia annual abundance in Nigeria\n\nStudies have shown that more than 20 medicinal plants have been identified in Nigeria. Some of these exist in various commodities, while some are indigenous to certain communities. While different communities have developed recipes or cocktail from various medicinal plants for the treatment of malaria, the increasing global attention paid to A. annua and the WHO\u2019s support for global development of the plant has made it of global importance. Also while the cocktails developed for malaria in different African communities may have been effective, the incidence of malaria is increasing in rural communities. Closely allied with this is the fact that the active ingredients in some of the medicinal plants have not been adequately characterized for the standardization. Also the plants vary from one community to another even within the same community and State.\n\nResearchers proffer solution on elimination of malaria\n\nA research conducted by Olukemi Amodu, revealed that malaria remains an important public health hazard globally. \u201cIt is responsible for high disease and death rates especially among children under five and pregnant women. The malaria burden in Nigeria is high \u2013 25% of cases globally. The causes include the climate, high transmission potential, socioeconomic development, an overstretched health care system and displaced populations.\u201d\n\nAnother researcher, George Ademowo stated that to beat the mosquitoes efforts should be geared towards drastic reduction of contact between humans and mosquitoes. \u201cSurveillance is a very important component of malaria elimination. Environmental management aims to control mosquitoes by removing their breeding sites and larvae. This can be done through clearing bushes around the house and other buildings. It is important to dispose of broken pots and bottles, fix potholes on our roads and keep gutters clean.\u201d\n\nFor Segun Isaac Oyedeji, artemesia-based combination drugs are the most acceptable treatment. Adding that, \u201cIn 1955, the WHO launched the Global Malaria Eradication Programme to eradicate malaria globally. But not all countries were involved in the programme. After some achieved elimination, its financiers stopped financial support and it stalled. Consequently, the responsibility to eliminate malaria now falls on individual countries which makes Nigeria part of this responsibility as well.\u201d\n\nRMRDC initiatives\n\nIn line with the research conducted and discussed, the Council in conjunction with other stakeholders like the Federal Ministry of Health has commenced the project to develop the antidote value chain in Nigeria. Report by RMRDC projects overview states that several meetings have been held between both organisations to achieve a cure.\n\nDirector General\u2019s view\n\nThe RMRDC Director General, Professor Hussain Doko Ibrahim, explained that in line with the present administration\u2019s resolve to halt importation into the country and encourage more export to add value the nation\u2019s GDP, is one of the major reasonbfoe developing \u2018artemesia annua\u2019 value chain. \u201cInstead of Chinese, the country is now planning to source its technology for artemisinin and ACT\u2019s production from Vietnam.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) in 2004, recommended the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria.",

          "text": "A former Governor of Kano state, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, has urged National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Ahmed Tinubu to help resolve the crisis facing the state chapter of the party.\n\nHe said all aggrieved parties in the dispute are currently waiting on the former Lagos state governor to wade in.\n\nShekarau stated this Tuesday 48 hours after meeting the party\u2019s national leader in Lagos.\n\nSpeaking in a BBC Hausa interview on his visit to Kano, the lawmaker said: \u201cI told Mr Tinubu that the crisis in Kano APC was not between myself and Ganduje, it is a disagreement of the party leadership in the state; we were sidelined in the affairs of the party in the state.\n\n\u201cTinubu told me that Governor Ganduje initially briefed him about the crisis. So, as a leader, he deemed it necessary to invite me to hear from me and he sent for me and we met on Sunday in Lagos.\u201d\n\nThe former Kano state governor also said all rival factions had briefed Tinubu on the crisis with a view to resolving it.\n\n\u201cHe is a party leader; he will eventually render his advice on the next line of action for the success of the party,\u201d Shekarau said.\n\nAt the last APC congresses held October 18, two set of executive councils emerged in the state.\n\nThe Shekarau faction, with two senators and four members of the House of Representatives on their side, elected Haruna Danzago as chairman while Abdullahi Abbas emerged the chairman of the Ganduje group.\n\nBut the APC National Appeal Committee recognised the Ganduje faction led by Abbas, a decision the Shekarau group challenged at a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja.\n\nHowever, in a recent ruling, the court upheld the legality of Shekarau- backed exco.\n\nFurther to this, the court also restrained the Ganduje group from appointing new leaders for the party in the state.\n\nBut the Ganduje-led faction filed a stay of execution as it vowed to appeal the judgement.\n\nSuit on Buni c\u2019ttee\n\nIn a related development, a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) sitting in Jabi, Abuja, has fixed December 17 to commence hearing in a suit filed by an aggrieved member of the APC, Okosisi Emeka Ngwu.\n\nNgwu is seeking an order setting aside all actions and decisions taken by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.\n\nJustice Babangida Hassan gave the order in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/1824/2021 and filed by his lawyer, Chief Oba Maduabuchi (SAN).\n\nThe plaintiff is further seeking an order of court dissolving the Committee known as and called the Caretaker/ extraordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\nOther defendants in the matter are the All Progressives Congress; Isiaka Oyebola; Ken Nnamani; Stell Okorete; Governor Sani Bello; Dr. James Lalu; Senator Abubakar Yusuf; Hon Akenyemi Olaiade: David Leon; Abba Ali; Prof. Tahir Mammam, Ismail Ahmed and Senator James Akpan Udoedehe.\n\nNgwu stated that he wanted to contest the position of the National Chairman of the APC in 2018 when the term of the national chairman of the party expired but was prevailed upon to allow Adams Oshiomhole to be returned un-opposed.\n\nThat after two years, he was surprised to hear that the National Executive Committee and National Working Committee had been dissolved and a contraption known as Caretaker/Extraordinary Planning Committee was created by an unknown person and Mai Mala Buni asked unilaterally to head the committee.\n\nThat he was surprised as by the constitution of the party, the National Executive Committee would be in office for four years until June 22, 2022.\n\nHe is therefore seeking a declaration that unless an election is conducted in accordance with the Electoral Act and by an organ known to and created by the constitution of the All Progressives Congress, no valid candidates can emerge from such a primary.\n\nWhether there is any organ of the All Progressives Congress known as Caretaker/Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) created in or by the Constitution of the party.\n\nWhether the organisation known as and called Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee is one of the organs created by Article 11 of the constitution of the political party known as and called the All Progressives Congress.\n\nHe also sought to know whether a valid candidate or officer of the party can emerge from a congress fixed by any other organ of a political party outside the National Executive Committee of a political party including the APC.\n\nConsequent upon this, the court granted an order for extension of time for the APC to enter its appearance in the suit and to file other processes as was prayed by its counsel, Daniel Akinwale.",

          "text": "\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced intense pressure Wednesday after a video emerged of his senior aides joking about holding a Christmas party at Downing Street last year when social gatherings were banned under COVID-19 rules.\n\nThe leaked video appears to contradict more than a week of denials by Johnson and his ministers that a party took place, following newspaper reports dozens of staff had attended an evening-long gathering on December 18, 2020.\n\nIt is the latest instance of apparent government hypocrisy over restrictions after several previous scandals, including health secretary Matt Hancock resigning in June for breaking coronavirus curbs during an affair with an aide.\n\nREAD ALSO: Trump White House Chief Risks Criminal Charge In Capitol Riot Probe\n\n\u201cWe now know the government broke the rules, they partied and now they\u2019re laughing about it \u2014 they\u2019re treating the public with contempt,\u201d Labour party leader Keir Starmer said.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister needs to step up, accept what happened, and apologise.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who has repeatedly claimed \u2014 including in parliament last week \u2014 that all virus guidance has been observed, faces off again later Wednesday against the main opposition leader in the House of Commons for weekly questions.\n\nAfter the video was leaked to broadcaster ITV News late Tuesday, his office continued to insist no party had taken place.\n\nHowever, Health Secretary Sajid Javid cancelled a series of broadcast interviews Wednesday morning amid uproar about it, leaving no minister to answer questions.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Cheese and wine\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe footage shows Johnson\u2019s then press secretary Allegra Stratton fielding questions from advisor Ed Oldfield and other staff during a rehearsal press conference on December 22 with no media present.\n\nThe group laughs and trade jokes as they discuss a \u201cfictional party\u201d four days earlier, which reportedly involved food, drink, games, and \u201csecret Santa\u201d gift-giving.\n\n\u201cThis fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced,\u201d she laughs over joking exchanges about \u201ccheese and wine\u201d and whether the prime minister would \u201ccondone\u201d such an event.\n\nAt that time, London was under strict restrictions and indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned, while office parties were specifically outlawed.\n\nThe video, which has led main news bulletins and drawn millions of views online, drew prompt condemnation from across the political spectrum, with some even calling for Johnson\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cIt really isn\u2019t acceptable and I have to say, unfortunately, that on the basis of this behaviour\u2026 he should go, and he should go now,\u201d leader of the Scottish National Party Ian Blackford said. Conservative lawmakers were also among those demanding answers.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a laughing matter,\u201d Tory MP Roger Gale told the BBC after he watched the footage with \u201ctotal incredulity\u201d.\n\nHe added Johnson must provide a full explanation to parliament, adding: \u201cof course, to mislead the House of Commons deliberately would be a resignation matter\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Upsetting and shameful\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe scandal has echoes of an infamous incident earlier in the pandemic involving Johnson\u2019s then chief aide Dominic Cummings, who drove hundreds of kilometres to stay away from his London home during a lockdown.\n\nIt triggered outrage over perceived double standards by the government, and is widely seen as leading to a drop in compliance with restrictions in its aftermath.\n\nWith the fast spread of the Omicron variant in Britain, some Conservative lawmakers said the latest scandal would make reintroducing curbs \u201cmuch more difficult\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe events of the last 24 hours make it probably almost impossible now,\u201d influential backbench MP Charles Walker told Times Radio.\n\nMeanwhile, COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said it showcased \u201cthe behaviour of people who think they\u2019re above us\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are simply no words to describe how upsetting and shameful it is to then hear Boris Johnson\u2019s team laughing about breaking the rules they had made,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOthers followed them and could only say goodbye to their loved ones through a screen.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday conducted the official take-off of the planned $300 million African Medical Centre of Excellence (AMCE) to be implemented in Abuja by the Benedict Oramah-led African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank).\n\nAt the event which he attended virtually, the president who decried the rising cases of non-communicable diseases like cancer noted that unfortunately, West African countries lacked the wherewithal to deal with such ailments.\n\nAccording to Buhari, such ailments are now the highest contributors to non-communicable disease mortalities, representing more than 81 per cent of all NCD deaths in West Africa.\n\n\u201cCardiovascular ailments, cancers and haematological disorders have increasingly become matters of concern to public healthcare. The World Health Organisation (WHO) projects that deaths on the African continent attributable to cancer and diabetes are expected to rise over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe rising NCD burden coupled with inadequate medical infrastructure on the continent threatens the future of our people. Right now, many hospitals in the West African region are underfunded, underequipped, understaffed and relatively inaccessible to most patients especially from rural areas,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe president noted that inasmuch as the situation represents an opportunity for investment in African healthcare, it had not necessarily translated into increased investment activity in the most pressing areas that require intervention.\n\nHe explained that the problem was further exacerbated by the significant brain drain experienced by the continent, adding that the exodus of doctors and nurses to other continents had resulted in a significant gap between the required treatments for non-communicable and the available treatments and care.\n\n\u201cThe above challenges combine to create a regional health market with poor access to critical services and low perception of quality of care available,\u2019\u2019 the president noted.\n\nWhile lauding the bank, Buhari said the 500-bed specialist facility will provide services in the areas of oncology, cardiology, and haematology and will seek to address the significant shortage of clinical care options in the West African sub-region.\n\n\u201cThe AMCE demonstrates that Afreximbank is not only Africa\u2019s trade finance partner, but its a development partner,\u201d he said, adding that a stronger partnership with the private sector will help in improving health facilities and access in the country.\n\nAside Afreximbank , other partners in the project include Kings College Hospital, London, University of Winsconsin Teaching Hospital, USA and Christies Hospital, Manchester.\n\nAccording to the president, in addition to providing comprehensive care across the three critical care areas, the AMCE will offer educational services to develop talent and establish itself as a world-class research centre, in partnership with global institutions.\n\n\u201cThe success of the AMCE will pave the way for future investments and partnerships in the sector while raising the local standard of healthcare and providing a blueprint for quality of services required to address Nigeria\u2019s and Africa\u2019s healthcare and economic challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nOramah, in his remarks said the ceremony was one step towards self-reliance for Africa\u2019s health care delivery as the project will pool world-class technology and global talents, particularly the African diaspora.\n\nOramah noted that the 500-bed and estimated $300 million AMCE was conceived to promote intra-African medical tourism and reduce the outflow of over $7 billion annually in outbound medical tourism.\n\nHe added that the vision for the health centre was borne out of a personal experience he encountered following his recovery from a potentially life-threatening blood disorder.\n\nAside its services in the areas of diagnostics, oncology, haematology, cardiology and general healthcare services, he stated that another significant focus of the AMCE is to perform innovative and ground-breaking research, development and educational programmes in partnership with leading global institutions.\n\nIn addition, the bank said that the facility has the potential to establish the largest and most diverse biobank in West Africa enabling it to attract global and Pan-African partnerships making it a global point of reference and source of medical tourism in the region.\n\n\u201cIt will also offer residency, training and placement programmes such that physicians and students at local teaching hospitals will have opportunities to train under the expertise of its specialists and with the benefit of its AMCE\u2019s patient volumes.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with King\u2019s College Hospital will increase locally available clinical capabilities, provide education and training, relying on KCH\u2019s two centuries\u2019 of experience in providing specialist healthcare services, medicine, and medical research.\n\n\u201cAfreximbank will also set its sights on implementing a continent-wide plan of developing similar AMCEs with the aim of improving the quality of healthcare and health related research to cater for the African population,\u201d the African bank stated.\n\nThe Abuja AMCE is also expected to enhance service exports providing healthcare to over 50,000 people annually, promote employment and creating over 3,000 jobs during its construction and operational phases and conserve foreign exchange.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said all hands are on deck, with the inter-ministerial committee working to ensure that the project is actualised in a way that is beneficial to all parties.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday alerted the people of the state to a fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, noting that in the last three weeks, cases had risen from 0.1 per cent to 6 per cent.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, the governor who commiserated with all Lagos residents who lost their loved ones during the third wave of the pandemic, stated that aside the state, most of the continents of the world \u2013 including Africa \u2013 are now experiencing another round of the pandemic.\n\nBased on the state\u2019s analysis, Sanwo-Olu said the fourth wave was brought by the non-adherence to the laid down protocols to mitigate the pandemic and pleaded with residents to get vaccinated and follow the guidelines regarding the use of facemasks, public gatherings and travelling.\n\nAs of the 5th of December 2021, the governor stated that Lagos had recorded a total of 78,564 confirmed cases of COVID-19, explaining that of this number, 71,977 had recovered while 612 were being managed actively in the communities.\n\nIn addition, he said that over the course of managing the pandemic, about 6,066 patients had been admitted into the various COVID-19 care centres in the state with 686 registered fatalities.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Lagos State is not left out as we are also experiencing the beginning of a fourth wave with current positivity rate at 6 per cent. This is against the positivity rates of 0.1 per cent as at the middle of November 2021,\u201d he noted\n\nOn what the government is doing to mitigate the new wave, he said that the state had ramped up the percentage of vaccinated residents from 1.6 per cent to 30 per cent within one year.\n\nFurthermore, Sanwo-Olu said he had specifically mandated the state ministry of health to administer 8 million doses to 4 million residents by the 25th of December 2021 under the \u201cCount Me In campaign\u201d and deployed a robust strategy that involves the private sector to improve access to vaccines.\n\nIn addition, the governor said the state was launching 30 private priority sites for those who want to be vaccinated within a private health facility, clarifying that while vaccination at public centres remains free, there is an administration fee (N4,500 per dose and N6,000 for two doses) at private centres.\n\nWhile advising the people of the state to register for the vaccination to visit the registration portal at https://nphcda.vaccination.gov.ng/, he stressed that over the next couple of days, the state government will release policies to facilitate the uptake of vaccines to achieve desirable herd immunity.\n\nHe insisted that all social events must be duly registered to obtain \u201cEvent Safety Clearance\u201d state government, maintaining that where possible events should be held outdoors.\n\nOther guidelines during the festive season, according to him, are that occupancy limit at any event must not exceed 60 per cent of maximum design capacity of the event centre while every attendee of a social gathering must present their vaccination cards or digital bar code page showing at least first dose.\n\n\u201cIn unvaccinated people, a negative PCR within 72 hours will be an exemption. Everybody, irrespective of vaccination status, must be subject to Rapid Diagnostic test (Antigen) to be conducted at the event venue within 24 hours prior to the event at designated laboratories,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe governor noted that despite the huge financial obligation and constraints associated with managing the pandemic, his administration will continue to do everything within its power to ensure the preservation of the lives and livelihood of residents of Lagos state.\n\nWhile listing the protocols laid out by the presidential steering committee, the governor said that while they may be stringent, the tests are mandatory to assist the state monitor the inflow of positive passengers.\n\n\u201cBased on this, we will commence the prosecution of those that refuse to submit themselves for these mandatory tests by blacklisting their passports for 1 year.\n\n\u201cThis would be carried out in partnership with the presidential steering committee. In addition, all foreigners that flout the rules would be subject to possible deportation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I implore all intending inbound passengers to perform their required tests at any of the private laboratories within the Lagos state private laboratory consortium as and at when due,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also mentioned that the state had received very disturbing information about intending outbound passengers procuring fake Covid test results and/or vaccination cards for travel purposes.\n\n\u201cThis is a very worrisome trend for us to note and we are currently working with the NCDC, DSS and the police to investigate and bring to book the criminal gangs involved in this reprehensible activity.\n\n\u201cWe implore everyone to desist from patronising these gangs, as anyone found with a fake Covid test result and/or vaccination card will also be liable to prosecution and very stiff penalties.\n\n\u201cOur state mobile courts will be used to prosecute all those involved in flouting the regulations; as well as those engaged in the fraudulent production of fake COVID test results and vaccination certificates,\u201d he warned.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
